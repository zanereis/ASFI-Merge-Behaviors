* This change is preparation to support autotuning in microTVM. It\r\n   also cleans up a loose end in the microTVM RPC server\r\n   implementation.\r\n * Randomness is needed in two places of the CRT:\r\n    1. to initialize the Session nonce, which provides a more robust\r\n       way to detect reboots and ensure that messages are not confused\r\n       across them.\r\n    2. to fill input tensors when timing AutoTVM operators (once\r\n       AutoTVM support lands in the next PR).\r\n\r\n * This change adds TVMPlatformGenerateRandom, a platform function for\r\n   generating non-cryptographic random data, to service those

Motivation\r\nCurrently, our NMS API expects input and output data to be in a format ` [batch, num_anchors, 6] `, where 6 is for 4 bbox coordinates, score and class id. This format is highly inefficient for class-aware NMS, because to check if two bboxes are the same class, we need to load other 5 values. More discussion in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7154#issuecomment-750376423 and other comments in that PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR improved the memory layout of buffers used in the NMS kernel. Specifically, it unpacks `[batch, num_anchors, 6]` input into one `[batch, num_anchors, 4]` buffer for bboxes, and two `[batch, num_anchors]` buffers for scores and class ids. \r\n\r\n### Speed up\r\nThis change is expected to give a good speed up for the cases when the number valid boxes is large and there are class ids involved. For example, although the change in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7154 brings only modest speed up, combined with this PR the speed up becomes good, as shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPyTorch NMS workload from FasterRCNN / MaskRCNN (4500 boxes):\r\n\r\nCurrent main : 5.78 milli sec\r\nAfter rewrite in #7154 to restore class aware NMS: 5.23 milli sec\r\nWith memory layout improvement in this PR and the rewrite in #7154: 4.51 milli sec\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other consideration\r\nFor other cases, it is likely that there would be no speed up, but it should be no worse. For example, it doesn't improve NMS workload from Gluon SSD. When `return_indices=False`, which I think only applies to MXNet, there is additional concatenation of three buffers at the end. For Gluon SSD, this concat takes 40 micro sec on GTX 1070 ti, while the main NMS kernel takes 200 micro sec. If people think this additional concat is expensive, we really need to rethink our NMS API: The same concat is already happenning in all other frontends, because all frameworks other than MXNet gives NMS inputs in an unpacked form and concat is necessary to satisfy our NMS API.\r\n\r\nplease review @mbrookhart @Laurawly @vinx13 @trevor-m

porting up the µTVM AutoTVM code, seems that `check_correctness` assumes that each AutoTVM task is instantiated on the `llvm` builder with the same input shape as is used on the target. Even in tuning a conv2d for x86, I see conv2d_NCHWc used with AutoTVM trying different combinations of `C` and `c`. I don't think this approach is viable and from chatting with a few people it seems like it was a debug tool that might just be deprecated now.

updates GPU scatter in two ways, to improve performance on GPU MaskRCNN (should be better for other workloads).\r\n\r\n* PyTorch frontend uses 1D scatter of one element to emulate inplace assignment `arr[i] = v`, https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/d1399f378e37e9e4d9bfadc5cdae57fdc5bcaf7f/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py#L467-L472 Using sorting based scatter involves too much overhead for such small inputs. For small inputs, sequential scatter is better. The size threshold was chosen arbitrary (50).\r\n\r\n* The first kernel (initialization) of 4D scatter turns out very slow. It is actually much slower than the second sequential kernel, taking more than 10 milli sec of MaskRCNN runs as shown in the profile and trace below. It's likely the performance depends on input shape, but I found the way threading is done a bit strange. This PR changes the threading of the first kernel to be the same as other injective ops, to scale better regardless of input shapes.\r\n \r\n```\r\n            Type  Time(%)      Time     Calls

introduces the dynamic support to `strided_slice`. However, in the following case, the static workload will be treat as a dynamic:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncpp.strided_slice(weight, begin=[0, 0, 0, 0], end=[None, None, filter_h, filter_w])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the `None` in `end` is not `IntImmNode` and will be judged as a non-constant array. This PR changes the behavior by ignoring the undefined elements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the dynamic path also assumes `strides` array is always given, but it will be initialized to array of 1 after this path. Since I'm not sure what's the right behavior, I only add a checker to error out.\r\n\r\ncc @kevinthesun @mbrookhart

@trevor-m and @anijain2305 for finding this issue. Sometimes a model may propose 0 boxes, and the code had a place that ended up assigning uninitialized memory to valid_counts, which could cause memory access issues in NMS.\r\n\r\nThe diff is kind of ugly, but this PR simply wraps the exclusive scan in this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    with ib.if_scope(num_anchors > 0):\r\n        # Old code\r\n    with ib.else_scope():\r\n        with ib.new_scope():\r\n            bx = te.thread_axis(\"blockIdx.x\")\r\n            ib.scope_attr(bx, \"thread_extent\", batch_size)\r\n            with ib.if_scope(bx < batch_size):\r\n                valid_count[bx] = 0\r\n```\r\nWhich runs the algorithm if there are boxes to check, and otherwise assigns valid_count to 0.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since the issue is randomly uninitialized memory getting assigned to valid_count, I haven't been able to write a unit test that consistently fails with the old code, so this just includes the

to #7197 and #6964, and fix #7207.\r\n\r\nDebugRuntime used to represent runtimes as doubles but in microseconds. An unintentionally merged part of #6964 migrated the timing parts to use seconds, but the display parts continued to use microseconds. This patch completes the migration and adds a test. We don't have to migrate this, but it's weird to me to store runtime in double, but not store it in seconds.

Motivation\r\nCurrently, shape functions are executed on CPU, even if the model is running on GPU. Each shape function is declared with `data_dependent` flag, specifying whether or not the shape function needs the input tensors themselves or only the shapes of input tensors, to compute output shape:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/9e766d9e6c0c999be0aa1dbfd890edb702472c93/python/tvm/relay/op/op.py#L359-L368\r\n\r\nWhen an op's `data_dependent` is true, VM will do device to host memcpy of entire tensors before running that op's shape func on CPU. In particular, since `dyn.strided_slice` has `data_dependent` True, VM would do device to host memcpy of a to-be-sliced tensor for every `dyn.strided_sllice` invocation, which can be highly expensive if the tensor is big.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/9e766d9e6c0c999be0aa1dbfd890edb702472c93/python/tvm/relay/op/dyn/_transform.py#L195\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the bottlenecks of running PyTorch MaskRCNN on GPU is this repeated device to host memcpy, as shown in the profiler output below. Most of them is for `dyn.strided_slice` shape func. `CUDA memcpy HtoD` is also very slow, but this is necessary to send large parameters once to GPU.\r\n```\r\n==2531== Profiling application: python maskrcnn_test.py                                                                                                                      \r\n==2531== Profiling result:                                                                                                                                                   \r\n            Type  Time(%)      Time     Calls       Avg       Min       Max  Name                                                                                            \r\n GPU activities:   16.59%  32.814ms        58  565.76us  30.112us  1.0854ms  fused_expand_dims_concatenate_1_kernel0                                                         \r\n                    9.37%  18.524ms       475  38.998us     544ns  5.3433ms  [CUDA memcpy HtoD]                                                                              \r\n                    9.09%  17.983ms         4  4.4957ms  4.4597ms  4.5401ms  fused_nn_conv2d_add_nn_relu_20_kernel0                                                          \r\n                    8.77%  17.350ms         1  17.350ms  17.350ms  17.350ms  fused_nn_conv2d_transpose_add_nn_relu_kernel0                                                   \r\n                    7.54%  14.912ms      2283  6.5310us     672ns  7.8311ms  [CUDA memcpy DtoH]                                                                              \r\n                    4.33%  8.5701ms         1  8.5701ms  8.5701ms  8.5701ms  fused_nn_conv2d_add_5_kernel0                                                                   \r\n                    4.27%  8.4386ms         1  8.4386ms  8.4386ms  8.4386ms  fused_nn_conv2d_add_nn_relu_16_kernel0 \r\n                    2.68%  5.3057ms         2  2.6528ms  399.20us  4.9065ms  sgemm_128x128x8_NT_vec                      \r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if we think about it, these expensive copyings are completely useless: shape func of `dyn.strided_slice` only needs data shape. But since other arguments `begin, end, strides` require their tensor values, `dyn.strided_slice` needs to declare its `data_dependant` flag to be True. This issue can be resolved if we let each op declare its data dependence per input.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\nLuckily, decisions to insert device-to-host memcpy before shape func is already done per each input separately, as shown below: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/4c4888bc19ff17d0de8de57b2c6876ffbf6f0fde/python/tvm/relay/transform/memory_alloc.py#L207-L221\r\n\r\nSo all we need to do is to have a way to specify per-input data dependence for each op, and send these information to `ManifestAllocPass` above. This PR enables such specification like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@_reg.register_shape_func(\"dyn.strided_slice\", [False, True, True, True])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also updated `compile_engine.cc` accordingly to send per-input data dep information to `ManifestAllocPass`. The change I made is minimum necessary to achieve my goal, so it can be improved. With this PR, I was able to remove all expensive device-to-host memcpy, and it cuts GPU MaskRCNN runtime by 14 millisecond. More importantly, the purpose of this PR is to let people aware of this problem, and decide the best solution.\r\n\r\nplease review @icemelon9 @zhiics @kevinthesun @mbrookhart

implementation of thrust argsort, when given multi dimensional inputs to sort along the inner most axis, is very inefficient: it does `n_iter` calls to thrust sort. See\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/bad149ed8a555444d813537608ee5cea9e95e97e/src/runtime/contrib/thrust/thrust.cu#L50-L65\r\n\r\nWhen the outer dimension is large, the performance of thrust argsort is far from optimal. In particular, the thrust numbers shown in the TIR mergesort PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7099 do not reflect the true performance thrust can achieve. \r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `n_iter` calls to thrust argsort with one **segmented sort by key**. Since thrust doesn't provide API to do segmented sort, I used a neat back-to-back stable-sort-by-key trick explained in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/thrust-users/BoLsxO6b4FY. My implementation is a bit more complicated because we need to do segmented sort **by key**, not just segmented sort. \r\n\r\nHere are the numbers I get using the same benchmark script used in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7099, measured on GTX 1070 ti. When the outer dimension is small (like 2, 2, 2000 case), my change makes it slower due to the overhead from two calls to `stable_sort_by_key`. But other than that, it is much faster than one we have now.\r\n\r\nAlso, I removed `tvm.contrib.thrust.sort_nms` and `argsort_nms_thrust`, since they are not used anymore.\r\n\r\nplease review @kazum @Laurawly \r\n(cc @mbrookhart when you are back, this should be exciting for you!) \r\n\r\n| Shape         | current thrust | after this PR | TIR mergesort

fix is proposed by @alec-anyvision, and this PR should solve the race condition mentioned here #6631.\r\n\r\nIn a very rare condition I have seen a couple of times that the outputs were inconsistent

https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/autoscheduler-and-vm/8750\r\n\r\nRemaining issues to auto-schedule PyTorch Mask R-CNN but not handled in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. There are still lots of extracted tasks only contain a shape_of op. This is because shape_of has TOpPattern kOpaque which is one target of auto_scheduler task extraction. The problem is other ops with this pattern may be tunable (e.g., softmax).\r\n2. Although the source tensor of shape_of in Mask R-CNN has dynamic shape (e.g., (Any, 28, 28)), it cannot be detected by checking I/O tensors, because it has no input tensors, and the shape of its output tensor is (3,) which is static.\r\n3. When extracting tasks for a NCHW model on x86, Conv2D NCHWc compute will be selected. However, we should provide the general NCHW compute to auto_scheduler for tuning.\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @masahi @jcf94

is a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7136. I found a simple way to parallelize the inner loop of GPU NMS, which is currently done in a sequential way since https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6839 and hence extremely slow if the number of input box is large. This change brings massive speedup on object detection models from PyTorch and Gluon, as shown below. \r\n\r\n```\r\nGPU NMS workload from PyTorch MaskRCNN (4500 boxes)\r\nBefore: 2.1 sec\r\nAfter: 5.78 milli sec \r\n\r\nWorkload from Gluon SSD\r\nBefore: 12.5 milli sec\r\nAfter: 0.206 milli sec\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore I explain what I did, here is how currently we do the sequential, O(N ** 2) triangle loop. This is done by a single thread.\r\n```\r\n# The outer loop goes through boxes sorted by their score.\r\nfor j in range(nboxes):\r\n    # The inner loop check if box j does not overlap with all other preceding boxes k\r\n    for k in range(j):\r\n        if box k is valid:\r\n            do IOU test between j and k and possibly invalidate j\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy parallelization instead does the above triangle in the following way:\r\n```\r\nfor j in range(nboxes):\r\n   if j is still valid:\r\n        for k in range(j + 1, nboxes) in parallel:\r\n             do IOU test between j and k and possibly invalidate box k\r\n   # Flush IOU test results from the inner loop to global memory before continuing to the next loop\r\n   # So that other threads can also see them\r\n   syncthreads() \r\n``` \r\nThe idea is, at the start of the inner loop, box j is assumed to be a valid box, and the inner loop invalidates other succeeding boxes that have high overlap with the newly found valid box j. The inner loop can be trivially done in parallel and the number of IOU tests reduces to O(# selected boxes * N). \r\n\r\nNow, the inner loop is done in parallel and the other loop is sequential. All threads need to do the outer loop in a lock step: The results of checking if box j is still valid must be consistent across all threads. Since we cannot do global sync inside kernels, I use only one thread block for parallelization and use `__syncthreads()` after each inner loop.\r\n\r\nI have one more PR coming to optimize GPU NMS IR further.\r\n\r\nplease review @Laurawly @kevinthesun @zhiics @vinx13

some more documentation to µTVM. This PR:\r\n1. Adds a landing page under Getting Started. See RFC: [Sphinx and the Documentation Refactor](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-sphinx-and-the-documentation-refactor/8705)\r\n2. Adds a Design Doc for µTVM explaining the main design decisions as it is checked-in now. This doc will be living and should evolve as the design changes.\r\n3. Fixes the TFLite tutorial to work with the new build flow and Reference VM, and adds formatting.\r\n4. Fixes some of the setup instructions in the Reference VM tutorial.\r\n\r\nThere are some known limitations:\r\n - Right now the build of TensorFlow installed by pip on the Reference VM doesn't work with VirtualBox (see [ticket](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/15471)). Need to find another build that doesn't use FMA (we don't care about TF performance, we just need to use it with tflite).\r\n - I'll retry building the VMWare Reference VM base box and see if that can help partially remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n@tqchen

adds support for sort by key in topi cuda by refactoring the sort IR developed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7099. By doing different initialization, the exact same sort IR can be reused for sort by key. This is because the original IR already supports argsort and argsort is just a special case of sort by key.\r\n\r\nMy motivation was to improve the default performance of scatter 1D using sorting based approach (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7056), when thrust is not available. But it turns out that the sequential scatter kernel is much faster than doing TIR sort, so I dropped that goal for now (this also suggests that thrust's radix sort I used in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7056 is insanely fast). I am sending this PR anyway in the hope that someone would find sort by key useful. My branch that does scatter 1D using the TIR sorting kernel, along with a benchmark script, is available at https://github.com/masahi/tvm/tree/sort_ir_refactor_with_scatter\r\n\r\nI also removed `sort_nms_ir`, since it is not used anymore and I think it would be much faster to sort entire rows using `sort_ir` anyway. \r\n\r\nplease review @mbrookhart @Laurawly @zhiics @tkonolige

used by PyTorch detection model actually performs multiclass NMS in one go, by adding different offsets to boxes from different classes so that two boxes from different classes never overlap. See \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/3d60f498e71ba63b428edb184c9ac38fa3737fa6/torchvision/ops/boxes.py#L80-L89\r\n\r\nBut this means most of O(N**2) IOU tests we do in the NMS triangle loop are useless. The goal of this PR is to restore class indices which is one of the inputs to `batched_nms` function above and perform class-aware NMS for TVM-compiled detection models. \r\n\r\nI did this by pattern matching and rewriting after model import. Specifically, I pattern match against [this subgraph](https://github.com/masahi/torchscript-to-tvm/blob/master/nms-perf-issue/maskrcnn_relay.txt#L1153-L1177) corresponding to PyTorch `batched_nms` used by maskrcnn / faster rcnn.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this optimization didn't yield speedup I hoped: On GPU it only makes 70ms faster, and on CPU it actually makes it slightly slower (?) for some reason. I haven't looked into why it is not going much faster. \r\n\r\nnvprof output from running MaskRCNN on GPU\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n```\r\n            Type  Time(%)      Time     Calls       Avg       Min
