When such tests run in parallel outside\nof Docker, the child VM can attempt to bind to ports that are in use by\ntests in other JVMs.\n\nCAUSE\n=====\n\nWhen the `ClusterStartupRule` starts a member in a child VM, it does so\nby creating the appropriate member starter rule (`LocatorStarterRule` or\n`ServerStarterRule`) in the child VM. Depending on how this member\nstarter rule is configured, it may call `AvailablePort` in the child VM\nto assign certain ports.

The test JVM always\nincludes the latest implementations of `AvailablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper`, and so the tests  will honor any port allocation\nscheme defined in the latest implementation.\n\nTHIS COMMIT\n===========\n\n- Change `LocatorStarterRule`, `ServerStarterRule`, and their common\n  base class `MemberStarterRule` to pre-assign available ports in their\n  constructors. They use `AvailablePortHelper` to assign the ports, and\n  store the assigned port numbers as fields.\n- Change `ClusterStartupRule` to construct any required member starter\n  rules in the test JVM instead of in the child VM. As a result, the\n  member starter rules call `AvailablePort` and `AvailablePortHelper`\n  only in the test JVM, where (eventually) the implementation will honor\n  the range of ports allocated to the JVM.\n- When the `ClusterStartupRule` sends the member starter rule to the\n  child VM, the member starter rule is deserialized in the child VM with\n  the pre-assigned port numbers.  If the member starter rule is\n  configured to assign a port, it uses the one that was pre-assigned in\n  the test JVM.\n","created_at":"2021-05-17T20:54:05Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T19:06:28Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T19:06:25Z","merged_at":"2021-05-19T19:06:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0dc407e77fedd07a15c66b3088092ac309a47da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/0d3f9368f25aaa17901448e545f4b650eb0c9e71","head":{"label":"demery-pivotal:geode-8772/starter-rules","ref":"geode-8772/starter-rules","sha":"0d3f9368f25aaa17901448e545f4b650eb0c9e71","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159222461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkyMjI0NjE=","name":"geode","full_name":"demery-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

JVM.\n","created_at":"2021-05-17T20:47:29Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T20:53:01Z","closed_at":"2021-05-17T20:53:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49bdff8697d3b2bda84bc672024a38f6f65543b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6490/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6490/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6490/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/2e7e97af7c565fce852a95b9f433723fe4bdeb3f","head":{"label":"demery-pivotal:geode-8772/starter-rules","ref":"geode-8772/starter-rules","sha":"2e7e97af7c565fce852a95b9f433723fe4bdeb3f","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159222461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkyMjI0NjE=","name":"geode","full_name":"demery-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

description:\r\n\r\n> While debugging another issue I noticed that a locator was trying to send a notice to another locator in its cluster telling it that the recipient had joined.\r\n> ```\r\n> [warn 2021/02/16 15:16:56.195 PST locatorgemfire_4_3_host2_9736 <LocatorsDistributorThread1> tid=0x153] Locator Membership listener permanently failed to exchange locator information rs-GEM-3188-VJ1459-1a0i3large-hydra-client-1:27878 with rs-GEM-3188-VJ1459-1a0i3large-hydra-client-2:28778 after 3 retry attempts\r\n> ```\r\n> This messaging is unnecessary.  The locator that this message was being sent to already knows about itself.   This is being done in DistributeLocatorsRunnable.run(). \r\n> ```\r\n>        for (DistributionLocatorId remoteLocator : entry.getValue()) {\r\n>        // Notify known remote locator about the advertised locator.\r\n>        LocatorJoinMessage advertiseNewLocatorMessage = new LocatorJoinMessage(\r\n>           joiningLocatorDistributedSystemId, joiningLocator, localLocatorId, \"\");\r\n>        sendMessage(remoteLocator, advertiseNewLocatorMessage, failedMessages);\r\n>\r\n>        // Notify the advertised locator about remote known locator.\r\n>        LocatorJoinMessage advertiseKnownLocatorMessage =\r\n>            new LocatorJoinMessage(entry.getKey(), remoteLocator, localLocatorId, \"\");\r\n>        sendMessage(joiningLocator, advertiseKnownLocatorMessage, failedMessages);\r\n>       }\r\n>  ```\r\n>  It should check to see if the joiningLocator ID is equal to the remoteLocator ID and, if so, not create messages in that iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce the issue using a distributed test, with no success. I have not been able to find a scenario in which the joining locator and the remote locator are the same.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I realized that the assumption in the ticket is wrong because the two locators in the log message are different: one ends in `client-1:27878` and the other one in `-2:28778`.\r\n\r\nIts true that it is not verified in the code that joining locator and remote locator are different but Im not sure if this situation could ever happen. I have implemented the changes anyway, adding a unit test to verify that messages are sent to both locators when they are different, and no message is sent when the locators are the same.\r\n\r\nDoes it worth it to merge this PR? Or should I discard it and close the ticket?","created_at":"2021-05-17T09:52:52Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T10:58:17Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T10:58:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0270ebf4e0c4fc78b241cbb5860d8e28d4095037","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6486/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6486/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6486/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/4f427d497dda5fee105f05af6e8c39cea0c8cd2e","head":{"label":"Nordix:feature/GEODE-8951","ref":"feature/GEODE-8951","sha":"4f427d497dda5fee105f05af6e8c39cea0c8cd2e","user":{"login":"Nordix","id":36034376,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MDM0Mzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36034376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix","html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":180747280,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODA3NDcyODA=","name":"geode","full_name":"Nordix/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Nordix","id":36034376,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MDM0Mzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36034376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix","html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix/geode","description":"Apache

group-transaction-events is set to true\r\nthe SerialGatewaySenderQueue class stores those events\r\npeeked from the queue to complete transactions\r\nfor a batch inside the extraPeekedIds member. This is done\r\nso that, when new events are peeked from the queue\r\nby peekAhead() to be put in a batch, the\r\nevents in extraPeekedIds are skipped. Otherwise\r\nthose events will be sent several times.\r\nWhen the remove method of SerialGatewaySenderQueue\r\nis called, the peekedIds member and the head key\r\nof the queue are updated and events from extraPeekedIds\r\nare removed if necessary.\r\nGiven that the peekAhead() method first gets the\r\ncurrentKey (that depends on the peekedIds and the headkey)\r\nand then checks if the event to be removed is in extraPeekedIds,\r\nit could be that in between those two calls,\r\nremove() is called from another thread, causing that\r\npeekAhead() returns an event that\r\nbelonged to extraPeekedIds when the currentKey was\r\nobtained but was deleted from extraPeekedIds by remove()\r\nbefore it was checked that the event belonged to\r\nextraPeekedIds.\r\nThis provokes that an event already peeked is returned\r\nagain by peekAhead() leading to duplicate events\r\nsent by the gateway sender.\r\n\r\nThe solution proposed to solve this problem is to make\r\nsynchronized the peekAhead() function when group-transaction-events\r\nis set given that remove() is already synchronized.

reproduces when following conditions are fulfilled:\r\n   - Redundant partition region must be configured\r\n   - Number of servers must be greater than number of redundant copies of partition region\r\n   - Parallel gateway sender must be configured on partition region\r\n   - Client must register CQs for the region\r\n   - Transactions must be used with put operations\r\n   - Events must be enqueued in parallel gateway senders (remote site is unavailable)\r\n\r\n Server that is hosting primary bucket will send TXCommitMessage to the secondary\r\n server, and also to the server that is hosting CQ subscription queue (if CQ condition is fulfilled). \r\n The problem occurs when the server that is hosting CQ subscription queue does not host\r\n the bucket for which event is received. In that case the server will store the event in \r\n bucketToTempQueueMap, because it assumes that the bucket is in the process of the\r\n creation, which is not correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fix:\r\nNormal put operation (transaction is not used) is distributed to adjunct\r\nmember (only host sub. queue, and not bucket) using seperate\r\npartition.PutMessage which indicates that it is notificationOnly, and\r\nalso sets TailKey to -1. Adjunct member will not store event in queue,\r\nbecause TailKey is always expected to be set in case of parallel\r\ngateway-sender. Members that host secondary bucket will receive the\r\nUpdateOperation message with valid TailKey value.\r\n\r\nSo this solution implements the similar approach to what is done in\r\ncase of normal put operation. TxCommitMessage with TailKey set to -1\r\nwill be sent only to adjunct member that host subscription queue, and not\r\nsecondary bucket. Other members will get valid TailKey value. Also,\r\nmember that host both secondary bucket and subscription queue will get\r\nvalid TailKey value.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

stopping gateway sender\r\n\r\nA bug was found in the SerialGatewaySenderQueue.hasEventsMatching() function\r\nthat provoked that sometimes incomplete transactions were sent\r\nin batches when group-transaction-events is true, right\r\nbefore the gateway sender is stopped.\r\n\r\nThe bug consisted in an error in the mentioned\r\nfunction that, when checking if there were\r\nevents in the queue belonging to a transaction, did\r\nnot check the event with the currentKey. Instead\r\nit started with the currentKey+1 until the\r\ntailkey was reached.\r\nThis provoked that some transaction events received in the\r\ngateway sender during the grace period before it is stopped\r\nwere not queued even though there were events in the queue\r\nfor the same transaction.\r\n\r\nWith the changes in this PR, the currentKey is also checked\r\nin the function to see if during the gateway sender stopping grace period\r\na received event should be queued or not.\r\n\r\nA couple of small refactorings have also been made\r\nin the SerialGatewaySenderQueue class.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

stopping gateway sender.\r\n\r\nWhen stopping a gateway sender having group-transaction-events\r\nset, there is a grace period in which events\r\nreceived that belong to transactions are not dropped\r\nif there are events in the queue belonging\r\nto that transaction. This is done to make\r\nsure that the queue does not contain incomplete\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nGiven that when the parallel gateway sender\r\ncreates a batch with events from the queue,\r\nit removes them from the queue as it adds them\r\nto the batch, it is possible that a transaction event\r\nreceived by a gateway sender during\r\nthe stopping grace period\r\ndoes not find events belonging to that transaction\r\nin the queue because they have been added to\r\na current batch and therefore that event will\r\nbe dropped, causing that an incomplete transaction\r\nwill be finally stored in the queue/batch.\r\nIn order to solve the issue, when receiving a\r\ntransaction event during the stopping grace period,\r\nthe gateway sender must look for events belonging\r\nto that transaction, not only in the queue\r\nbut also in the peekedEvents from the queue\r\n(those events retrieved from the queue and\r\nput in batches).\r\n\r\nAlso, in order to avoid flakyness of the distributed\r\ntest cases that test that batches with incomplete\r\ntransactions are not sent when stopping the\r\ngateway sender, the number of retries\r\nto get the events from the queue/batches\r\nhas been set to high number in the tests by means of\r\na new setter in GatewaySender which has\r\nalso been published as a gfsh and\r\ncache.xml parameter (get-transaction-events-from-queue-retries).\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

are problems with Geode's current quorum algorithm. In particular, split-brains are possible if locators are started at the same time, or if they are started during a network partition (and can't reach other locators).\r\n\r\nThis (draft) PR introduces an alternative quorum maintenance algorithm, activated by a new optional configuration parameter `quorum-absolute-locator-count`. When it's configured to a value greater-than-zero, two things are done differently:\r\n\r\n1. when a locator is starting or restarting, and it might potentially become the coordinator, it can become the coordinator only if it has communicated with `quorum-absolute-locator-count` locators (including itself).\r\n\r\n2. when a coordinator is considering whether a view change might result in a loss of quorum, rather than basing that decision on the change in membership weight between the current view and the prospective one, the locator count in the prospective view is compared to `quorum-absolute-locator-count`. If the locator count is below the threshold then it's treated as lost quorum, with all the usual processing that happens in that event.\r\n\r\nThe ability to switch between the legacy quorum algorithm and this new one is accomplished via a new policy object. `GMSJoinLeave` has a reference to a `Quorum` object. Legacy behavior is captured in the `DifferentialQuorum` implementation, and the new algorithm is embodied in the `AbsoluteQuorum` implementation. `GMSJoinLeave` delegates to the `Quorum` object in the `GMSJoinLeave.isLostQuorum()` method. (That method used to be called `isNetworkPartition()` but it was renamed since quorum can be lost due to reasons other than a network partition.)\r\n\r\nIn the legacy quorum algorithm, no quorum checking is done at cluster startup (when a coordinator is chosen). The new algorithm has to operate there. As a result `GMSJoinLeave.findCoordinator()` was modified to delegate to the `Quorum` object (so that the new algorithm can prevent cluster formation if too few locators are currently reachable).\r\n\r\nThis PR is very drafty so be kind.\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

A** geode contributor\r\n**I WANT TO** be able to start members with option `--bind-address=0.0.0.0`, `--bind-address=::` or `--bind-address=*`\r\n**SO THAT** all TCP endpoints are bound to all interfaces.\r\n\r\nIt is not currently possible to start cluster members binding to all interfaces. That is using `--bind-address=0.0.0.0` for ipv4 or `--bind-address=::` for ipv6.\r\n\r\nGeode binds the locator and server traffic port by default to `0.0.0.0`, but the membership ports are bound by default to the local address.\r\n\r\nChanging the default membership binding is not the best option, as it could cause problems in existing Geode deployments. But using `--bind-address=0.0.0.0`, `--bind-address=::` or `--bind-address=*` should be accepted.\r\n\r\nThere is a use case that needs this binding, that is using Istio with Geode. One of the requirements set by Istio towards applications trying to integrate with it is that the application listening ports need to be bound to 0.0.0.0 address (which listens on all interfaces).\r\n\r\nIt is currently not possible to start a cluster using wildcard address due to if `--bind-address` is specified, its value will be used for all tcp endpoints and the udp membership endpoint created by JGroups. And as JGroups does not accept binding to all addresses, and exception is thrown.

longer keeping ByteArrayWrapper classes in memory for RedisHashes or\r\ncreating ByteArrayWrapper classes when performing hash operations.\r\n\r\nThe main change to the RedisHash data structure was to switch from a\r\nHashMap<ByteArrayWrapper, ByteArrayWrapper> to a\r\nObject2ObjectOpenCustomHashMap<byte[], byte[]>. This saves ~50 bytes for each\r\nfield in the hash to not have the wrappers. Removing the extra allocations when\r\nperforming hash operations also helps performance.\r\n\r\nAlso removing a couple of extra unneeded allocations during logging and message\r\nparsing. We should always create ArrayLists, etc. with a size if it is known so\r\nthose objects don't have to resize during parsing/deserialization.\r\n\r\nMoving the hash commands executor to a shared object rather than allocating it\r\nfor each operation, which is extra GC pressure we don't need.\r\n\r\nThese changes BREAK compatibility with geode 1.14. The serialization format for\r\nRedisHash, AddsDeltaInfo, and RemsDeltaInfo has changed to not write\r\nByteArrayWrapper classes on the

GEODE-9155: Change frequency of passive expiration\r\n\r\nchange the interval in the PassiveExpirationManager from 1 second to 3\r\nminutes. this significantly reduces the CPU load of passive expiration.\r\n\r\nthis change requires that one redis test must be commented out in the\r\npatch file.\r\n\r\n* use the keys command instead of hkeys. hkeys increments the hit/miss stats, which the test is sensitive to\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 113aa7d487e2cf717cfbeb986114f28f6d988932)\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the

seems that in some cases, creation of buckets of colocated region can take some time to finish. Until it is finished, recovery threads are updating statistics, but since ValueMonitor is not notified to monitor PartitionedRegionStats (this will happen when creation of region is finished), this info is not propagated. When finally creation of region is finished, SampleCollector will interpret stats as old info, and will not propagate it. \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [*] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

original PR #6392 was closed because I took over the work on this ticket.\r\n\r\nA not serializable exception can cause a ServerConnection thread to get stuck\r\nwaiting for a reply from another member. This is caused by ReplyMessage\r\nnot handling a non-serializable \"returnValue\".\r\n\r\nThe fix is to catch and log the exception in the sending node and then\r\nhandle the problem in the receiving node.\r\n\r\nI would have liked to serialize the \"returnValue\" field into a separate buffer\r\nso as not to transmit a partial serialization of the object but that would require\r\nan extra buffer copy for every ReplyMessage sent, and we send a lot of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

contains utility methods used by `StartLocatorCommand` & `StartServerCommand`.\r\n\r\nOne of them is `resolveWorkingDir` which returns the working directory to be used by the member. Part of the logic of this procedure is placed outside the function:\r\n```\r\nworkingDirectory = StartMemberUtils.resolveWorkingDir(workingDirectory == null ? null : new File(workingDirectory), new File(memberName));\r\n```\r\nThis causes that tests of that function need to create an instance of `StartLocatorCommand` & `StartServerCommand` classes.\r\nAnd this has two negative
