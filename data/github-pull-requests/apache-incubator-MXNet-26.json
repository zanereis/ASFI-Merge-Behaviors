This PR builds on the previous work for dynamic library loading (#15760), partition API enhancements (#15886), and dynamic custom operators (#15921). It enables partitioning a model using a partitioning strategy loaded from an external library. \r\n\r\nThe model's symbolic graph is analyzed at bind time to determine which operators should be partitioned into a subgraph. Then this info is kept in a custom SubgraphProperty class instance until partition time. Then the custom SubgraphProperty uses this info to guide partitioning of the model and insert the custom subgraph operator specified in the external library. \r\n\r\nAt runtime, the operators in the model will be executed normally, including the custom subgraph operator. At this time, the subgraph can be executed by the external library just like any regular operator. This provides an interface for parts of the model to be executed on custom accelerators without any change to MXNet's source code (specifically for each accelerator).  \r\n\r\n## Design ##\r\nRather than provide a pure subgraph property interface to external libraries, we will provide a single API function that the user will implement to control the partitioning. The whole symbolic graph will be provided to the user -- post infer type & infer shape -- to analyze and determine which ops they want to include in subgraphs. They will return the node ID for each node in the graph that is supported. In this PR we implement a fixed custom SubgraphProperty in MXNet that will interface between the current Subgraph API and this streamlined \"supportedOps\" API in the external library.\r\n\r\nHeres an end-to-end overview, starting at the Python users' end. First, a user will load their custom library containing a custom subgraph operator and the implemented \"supportedOps\" API.\r\n```\r\nmx.library.load(path)\r\n```\r\nThen they will call the \"optimize_for\" API (from #15886) that will use the custom subgraph property to partition the graph. The name here is the name the user specified when registering their \"supportedOps\" function in the external library.\r\n```\r\npart_sym = sym.optimize_for(\"myProp\")\r\n```\r\nThis will then call the SubgraphProperty's \"PrePartition\" API and pass the whole model graph (post infer type/shape) to the custom subgraph backend/property.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/61013a8bf9ef8a7b79d684504df1b321b1efb8d8/src/c_api/c_api_symbolic.cc#L1305\r\nIn the custom subgraph property's \"PrePartition\" API, it will call the \"supportedOps\" API registered in the external library\r\n```\r\nint retval = callSupportedOps_(supportedOps_, json, supportedNodeIDs.size(), ids,\r\n                            opt_keys_.data(), opt_vals_.data(), opt_keys_.size());\r\n```\r\nThen the \"supportedOps\" API in the external library will be called. The symbol json string will be given as input, and any node that is supported by the external library will be set in a list of node IDs.\r\n```\r\nMXReturnValue mySupportedOps(std::string json,\r\n                             const int num_ids,\r\n                             int *ids,\r\n                             std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& options) {\r\n  return MX_SUCCESS;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen in the \"PrePartition\" function, these node IDs will be converted back into node names:\r\n```\r\nfor(int i=0; i<num_ids; i++) {\r\n      if(supportedNodeIDs[i]) {\r\n        supportedNodes.push_back(idx[i].source->attrs.name);\r\n        std::cout << idx[i].source->attrs.name << std::endl;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe supportedNodes vector is passed when creating the SubgraphSelector:\r\n```\r\nvirtual SubgraphSelectorPtr CreateSubgraphSelector() const {\r\n    return std::make_shared<CustomContainOpSelector>(supportedNodes);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nAnd then in the SubgraphSelector \"Select\" function is used to check if a given node should be included in the subgraph:\r\n```\r\nvirtual bool Select(const nnvm::Node &n) {\r\n    return supportedNodes_.count(n.attrs.name) > 0;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nFinally, after the subgraph is created the operator used is the one specified by the user for their custom subgraph operator:\r\n```\r\nvirtual nnvm::NodePtr CreateSubgraphNode(const nnvm::Symbol &sym,\r\n                                           const int subgraph_id = 0) const {\r\n    nnvm::NodePtr n = nnvm::Node::Create();\r\n    n->attrs.op = Op::Get(subgraph_op_name);\r\n    n->attrs.name = \"_op\" + std::to_string(subgraph_id);\r\n    n->attrs.subgraphs.push_back(std::make_shared<nnvm::Symbol>(sym));\r\n    return n;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nAt runtime, the regular user operator is called resulting in the execution of the custom operator for the subgraph that was partitioned. \r\n\r\nUsers register their partitioning strategy using the following API where they specify the name of their subgraphBackend (and subgraphProperty), the supportedOps function, and the name of the custom operator they want inserted for each subgraph created:\r\n```\r\nREGISTER_PARTITIONER(myProp)\r\n.setSupportedOps(mySupportedOps)\r\n.setSubgraphOp(\"_custom_subgraph_op\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that the MXNet subgraph API does de-cycle and other checks, the subgraph reviewed by the \r\n`supportedOps` API may differ than the final subgraph. To give the library an additional option to reject the final subgraph combination, we added an additional API `acceptSubgraph` that the library creator can implement. This is an optional API, and if implemented will be called from the `CreateSubgraphNode` API in the MXNet subgraph property. If accepted, the subgraph op will be created and inserted into the graph. If not, we'll reattach the subgraph inputs to the graph (reversing the functionality of CutGraphInputs in build_subgraph.cc) returning the graph to its original state. \r\n\r\nThis PR also sets an attribute for each subgraph input node \"isArg\" that is \"True\" if the subgraph input is also an input to the model (and not an output of some other operator in the model). This can be used by the accelerator library to avoid unnecessary data movement for the same data, or to execute further optimizations knowing that a particular subgraph input will be unchanged between calls. \r\n\r\n## Next Steps ##\r\n- docs, readme, tutorial\r\n- dynamic graph passes\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this

Description ##\r\nNumpy Op Array_split\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-10T06:31:40Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T21:52:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T21:52:39Z","merged_at":"2019-12-12T21:52:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"9092f17c909ae9f2af049d7787cc19015ee624d0","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4ca8a398012aca099c50005f701b8dc496c3b20e","head":{"label":"Tommliu:array_split","ref":"array_split","sha":"4ca8a398012aca099c50005f701b8dc496c3b20e","user":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":219631509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk2MzE1MDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964

Description ##\r\nUse CMake standard library to handle CUDA.\r\nMakes our code more maintainable and may fix bugs, because we rely on code tested by all CMake users, instead of the small subset of MXNet CMake users.\r\n\r\nInclude FindCUDAToolkit that replaces the deprecated FindCUDA module as of CMake 1.17.\r\nhttps://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/merge_requests/4093\r\n\r\n## Checklist

Description ##\r\nNumpy-compatible `hstack` was previously added in numpy branch #15302, porting the code to master branch now.\r\nAlso adding `dstack` for interoperability check.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] `np.hstack` op\r\n- [x] unit tests and interoperability tests\r\n- [x] interoperability tests for `np.dstack`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-10T01:49:23Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T20:50:32Z","closed_at":"2020-01-13T20:50:29Z","merged_at":"2020-01-13T20:50:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"461f16704cfdd7af13eec79b63cee67b427841ac","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/8d1f746bfec006be8a7270265de46ea28d74ec73","head":{"label":"haojin2:np_hstack","ref":"np_hstack","sha":"8d1f746bfec006be8a7270265de46ea28d74ec73","user":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114436356,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ0MzYzNTY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"haojin2/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4

Description ##\r\nFixes #17020 \r\n\r\nThe problem comes from the bug in how NVRTC in CUDA 9 handles the `default-device` flag. That flag is supposed to mark all the functions in the file as `__device__` functions, but it should leave the functions decorated differently (like kernels decorated with `__global__`) alone. This is the behavior in CUDA 10+. In CUDA 9, however, this `__device__` attribute is applied to every function (including kernels), which is incompatible with `__launch_bounds__()` attribute that we use for kernels.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the usage of `default-device` flag for NVRTC compilation and instead manually decorates all the required functions as `__device__`","created_at":"2019-12-09T22:44:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T07:31:23Z","closed_at":"2019-12-10T04:21:10Z","merged_at":"2019-12-10T04:21:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f5b8bca2e972d30ba22ab4a7287d55277af865e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1630817629,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjMwODE3NjI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/R1.6.0","name":"R1.6.0","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/be38e8a90eac7d5a33da85db0e5b2ca1e507f544","head":{"label":"ptrendx:pr_fix_cuda9","ref":"pr_fix_cuda9","sha":"be38e8a90eac7d5a33da85db0e5b2ca1e507f544","user":{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76683609,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjY4MzYwOQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"ptrendx/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2,

remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-09T10:59:18Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T11:00:02Z","closed_at":"2019-12-09T11:00:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"edeee6b3cfddc2ea1049a241c0b3d2ebf085dece","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4e6ff07b0af1dfe3ea63da3ee5ae86ff58ea5ce1","head":{"label":"DwwWxx:linalg_fix_solve","ref":"linalg_fix_solve","sha":"4e6ff07b0af1dfe3ea63da3ee5ae86ff58ea5ce1","user":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx","html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224129560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQxMjk1NjA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"DwwWxx/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx","html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-09T08:05:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T05:07:00Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T05:07:00Z","merged_at":"2019-12-11T05:07:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"9634786f96388004f68c223d72e120ad425c2f12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17021/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17021/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17021/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7ce1b6e22a78e8588a5ee7cfd45e87cd9a5673e2","head":{"label":"TaoLv:fix/mshadow-vector","ref":"fix/mshadow-vector","sha":"7ce1b6e22a78e8588a5ee7cfd45e87cd9a5673e2","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n- Use FindCUDNN.cmake instead of the previous macro\r\n- Previous macro did not detect CUDNN correctly on my system (Deep Learning AMI\r\n  Ubuntu 18.04) and did not generate any warnings that cudnn could not be found.\r\n\r\nWith FindCUDNN.cmake introduced here, based on https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.html, we will use the \"standard\" outputting methods to signify if cuDNN is found or missing.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Fix CUDNN detection for CMake build\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nCC @szha @yajiedesign @junrushao1994

Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Replace mxnet_option macro with CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION part of CMake \"standard library\"\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@cjolivier01 please

https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10856 for a discussion on the symptom. It seems it's due to a bug in llvm openmp fixed in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThe previously failing assertion is still part of the `release_90` version. It is at https://github.com/llvm-mirror/openmp/blob/release_90/runtime/src/kmp_runtime.cpp#L6616\r\nBut the assertion does not fail anymore (based on my test with `cmake -DUSE_CUDA=0 -DUSE_MKLDNN=0

Description ##\r\ndepends on https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17007 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16795 \r\nSee the `KVStoreBase` for all interfaces defined in `kvstore/base.py`. See `TestStore` class in the same file as an example of custom single node kvstore which implements minimal required interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe interfaces include:\r\n- broadcast\r\n- pushpull\r\n- num_workers\r\n- rank\r\n- type\r\n- is_capable\r\n\r\nWe can reuse these interfaces for other communication backends such as p3 and horovod. @anandj91 @apeforest \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nModified multi_sum_sq operator to avoid nondeterministic behavior, which was potentially caused by AtomicAdd operation on GPU kernel.\r\n  \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage: an specific test for multi_sum_sq operator has been included\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Modified GPU implementation of multi_sum_sq operator. The operator is launching several CUDA blocks per tensor. In the previous version, an atomic operation was used to reduce the sumSQ coming from different blocks. In this new version, we instead use a temporal storage space to write the reduction from each block, and we launch a second kernel to reduce

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [x] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nHi, there.\r\nI change the testing precision for test_ndarray.py:test_reduce, to make the CI happy.\r\nI have tested it for more than 900 times.\r\n\r\nRelated Test: http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/mxnet-validation%2Funix-cpu/detail/master/1349/pipeline\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] tiny change. The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Change the testing precision for test_ndarray.py:test_reduce\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-06T13:21:02Z","updated_at":"2019-12-07T23:59:29Z","closed_at":"2019-12-07T23:59:29Z","merged_at":"2019-12-07T23:59:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"93cf48dfa45c697437e6233577002a5a4e1b3cc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nunary op: matmul\r\nBecause matmul has a special signature (i.e. (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?)) in official numpy, I comment out the following  code segment in python/mxnet/numpy/multiarray.py :\r\nif ufunc.signature is not None:\r\n                # we don't support generalised-ufuncs (gufuncs)\r\n                return NotImplemented\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix nightly publishing scala gpu with cpu instance\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nDue to the potential estimator explosion issue introduced in issue #16930, we add support of plug and play `fit_batch()` and `evaluate_batch()` methods for the base estimator class. Concretely,\r\nwe define a new class `BatchProcessor` and use it to wrap the `fit_batch()` and `evaluate_batch()` methods. Our contribution can be summarized as below\r\n\r\n- Add a new class `BatchProcessor` to support plug and play `fit_batch` and `evaluate_batch` for existing estimators.\r\n- Add test case to test the plug and play `fit_batch()` and `evaluate_batch()` methods\r\n\r\nFix Issue #16930

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\n\r\n- Add kAddTo and kNullOp to np.transpose and fix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16789\r\n- Fix the problem that the previous np.tranpose support duplicated axis:\r\n\r\nPreviously, we can run the following code without any problem:\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nmx.npx.set_np()\r\na = mx.np.ones((3, 4, 5))\r\nb = mx.np.transpose(a, axes=(0, 0, 1))\r\nprint(b.asnumpy())\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we will raise an MXNetError\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nMotivated by the issue #16959, we find that we could use existing `LoggingHandler` and `MetricHandler` for validation purpose. We extend `estimator.evaluate()` to support default and customized handlers. Our contributions can be summarized below:\r\n\r\n- We extend estimator.evaluate() to support event_handlers\r\n- We replace the metrics in estimator constructor with train_metrics and val_metrics\r\n- We decouple the dependence of default event handlers on training or validation metrics \r\n- We add test script to verify the correctness of evaluate function \r\n\r\nFix

Description ##\r\nMKL builds for the dynamic libmxet are failing because because of a previous PR's change. It deleted `mx_mkldnn_deps` from the Jenkins file, however, this is needed by an underlying import.\r\n\r\nI also noticed a couple of inconsistencies: \r\n1. USE_NVTX=1 was not set for the cuda 9.0 make configuration\r\n2. ubuntu_gpu_cu101 was using an older cudnn version\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and

Description ##\r\nNumpy bincount operator\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nWe add validation model eval_net to the base estimator API. Users may use different models during training and validation. In this PR, we make the following contribution:\r\n\r\n-  We add the implementation of eval_net in the estimator class\r\n-  We add unit test for the introduced feature to ensure that parameter sharing works correctly for self.eval_net and self.net\r\n\r\nFixes issue

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nMultithreaded Inference Interface, see #16431 for detailed proposal\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nadd op linalg solve \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nMove shape_array to npx to facilitate the numpy version of transformer.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] quantile, tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- q must be ndarray type even if it is a scalar\r\n- do not support

Description ##\r\nMove arange_like to npx to support the numpy example of Transformer\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-22T01:50:01Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T14:20:21Z","closed_at":"2019-11-23T14:20:21Z","merged_at":"2019-11-23T14:20:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"971ea4f0adb5bd52cdcdee3e15f390ac05a3d379","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16883/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16883/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16883/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a4f912bc80d3043ec26b6b7db9ca637307cb1cff","head":{"label":"sxjscience:np_transformer_op","ref":"np_transformer_op","sha":"a4f912bc80d3043ec26b6b7db9ca637307cb1cff","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://gith
