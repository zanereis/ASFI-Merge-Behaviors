What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nConfigure the spark connect client to use the schema\r\nreturned from the service for all requests, instead of\r\nassuming the schema for data sets.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe `range()` query returns a result with one column named \"id\".\r\nHowever, when the underlying schema is queried, it returns the schema\r\nto contain one column named \"value\".\r\n\r\nThis is a bug and is different from the behaviour in other places,\r\nincluding pyspark.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this also fixes SPARK-43416.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. It fixes the bug for incorrect column names returned for a\r\nrange query.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests attached.","created_at":"2023-07-04T07:41:25Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T19:13:06Z","closed_at":"2023-07-05T19:13:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2957e947a3bc1a158e791b50a04f52916ea5ae8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41846/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41846/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41846/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c1d30812b396b61e948da885dcfdd6e4d49f85c2","head":{"label":"nija-at:fix-range-schema","ref":"fix-range-schema","sha":"c1d30812b396b61e948da885dcfdd6e4d49f85c2","user":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":590063058,"node_id":"R_kgDOIyul0g","name":"spark","full_name":"nija-at/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an overflow issue upon reading an \"infinity\" timestamp from PostgreSQL. It addresses the issue by adding a new function, convertJavaTimestampToTimestamp, to the JDBCDialects API, and overrides it in PostgresDialect.scala by clamping the special \"infinity\" timestamps to long.max and long.min.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe pre-existing default behavior of timestamp conversion potentially triggers an overflow due to these special values (i.e. The executor would crash if you select a column that contains infinity timestamps in PostgreSQL.) By integrating this new function, we can mitigate such issues, enabling more versatile and robust timestamp value conversions across various JDBC-based connectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nA new function, convertJavaTimestampToTimestamp, is added to the JDBCDialects API to allow JDBC dialects to override the default behavior of converting Java timestamps.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAn integration test was added in PostgresIntegrationSuite.scala to verify it can handle +infinity and -infinity timestamps in PostgreSQL.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-04T05:52:49Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T16:01:39Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T06:48:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa004e6251f10617d1d0034af81bce12d77bebe1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/30db0bb9328b737731dfbdfe1b30edb11abfb41d","head":{"label":"mingkangli-db:SPARK-44280","ref":"SPARK-44280","sha":"30db0bb9328b737731dfbdfe1b30edb11abfb41d","user":{"login":"mingkangli-db","id":134358080,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAIkQA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134358080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mingkangli-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":657715679,"node_id":"R_kgDOJzPx3w","name":"spark","full_name":"mingkangli-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mingkangli-db","id":134358080,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAIkQA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134358080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mingkangli-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingkangli-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mingkangli-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR prepares moving DataType parsing to sql/api. Basically it puts all DataType parsing functionality in a super class of regular parsing. We cannot move the parser just yet because that need to happen at the same time as DataType.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want the Spark Connect Scala Client to use a restricted class path. DataType will be one of the shared classes, to move DataType we need to move DataType parsing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing tests.","created_at":"2023-07-03T22:04:56Z","updated_at":"2023-07-06T00:46:26Z","closed_at":"2023-07-05T20:22:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4fb932018408dc6910bda8edae8112371c93c7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f718576680fba61c97053984b6edf697c0392ca5","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-44282","ref":"SPARK-44282","sha":"f718576680fba61c97053984b6edf697c0392ca5","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nXML is a widely used data format. An external spark-xml package (https://github.com/databricks/spark-xml) is available to read and write XML data in spark. Making spark-xml built-in will provide a better user experience for Spark SQL and structured streaming. The proposal is to inline code from spark-xml package.\r\n\r\nThe PR has the following commits:\r\ni) The first commit has the following:\r\n- Copy of spark-xml src files.\r\n- Update license\r\n- Scala style and format fixes\r\n- Change AnyFunSuite to SparkFunSuite\r\n\r\nii) Miscellaneous import and scala style fixes.\r\niii) Add library dependencies\r\niv) Resource file path fixes and change AnyFunSuite to SharedSparkSession or SQLTestUtils\r\nv) Exclude XML test resource files from license check\r\nvi) Change import from scala.jdk.Collections to scala.collection.JavaConverters\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBuilt-in support for XML data source would provide better user experience than having to import an external package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, Add built-in support for XML data source.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested the new unit-tests that came with the imported spark-xml package.\r\nAlso ran

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces a configurable retry mechanism for the Scala `SparkConnectClient`.\r\nParameters for the exponential backoff and a filter for exceptions to retry are passed to the client via the existing (extended) `Configuration` class. By default, only RuntimeStatusException: Unavailable triggers a retry - this mirrors the default retry behavior in the Python client.\r\n\r\nOne might want to move the retry logic into the GRPC stub that will potentially be introduced [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41743).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are a few existing exceptions that one might want to handle with a retry.\r\nFor example, this would allow one to not exit with an exception when executing a command while the cluster is still starting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests included.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-03T11:44:15Z","updated_at":"2023-07-07T02:56:23Z","closed_at":"2023-07-07T02:56:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da62954ce4a15b17a39de1f2b3e2f0c62310c0c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41829/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41829/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41829/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d37a9af6d7411b4ae823d191355179e148d78d20","head":{"label":"dillitz:spark-44275-retries","ref":"spark-44275-retries","sha":"d37a9af6d7411b4ae823d191355179e148d78d20","user":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":661600404,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ284lA","name":"spark","full_name":"dillitz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. Change `statCache.getOrElse` to `statCache.getOrElseUpdate` so that the corresponding FileStatus can be cached into `statCache`\r\n2. Change the `Path` parameter `isPublic`,  `checkPermissionOfOther`, and `ancestorsHaveExecutePermissions` to `URI`. \r\n3. Add `getParentURI` method when we construct the parent URI. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe should not use `uri.getPath()` when constructing the Path which will not retain information like scheme. This means that `statCache` is not really taking any effect.\r\nFor example, if uri is \"file:/foo.invalid.com:8080/tmp/testing\", then \r\n\r\n```\r\nuri.getPath -> /foo.invalid.com:8080/tmp/testing\r\nuri.toString -> file:/foo.invalid.com:8080/tmp/testing\r\n```\r\nPlease also see more details from JIRA [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44272). \r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdd additional UT to validate the FileStatus is cached as expected.

joins implicitly add an aliased coalesce to the parent projection of the join: `coalesce(v1.c1, v2.c1) as c1`. In the case where only one side's key is nullable, the coalesce's nullability is false. As a result, the generator's output has nullable set as false. But this is incorrect: If one side has a row with explicit null key values, the other side's row will also have null key values (because the other side's row will be \"made up\"), and both the `coalesce` and the `explode` will return a null value.\r\n\r\nWhile `UpdateNullability` actually repairs the nullability of the `coalesce` before execution, it doesn't recreate the generator output, so the nullability remains incorrect in `Generate#output`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-30T17:14:40Z","updated_at":"2023-07-17T18:04:28Z","closed_at":"2023-07-11T03:19:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc6872bb3c738f1c54a1c1f7bbdb4aa39f4ed785","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4dec00f55e5571a6d215a16dcdfde77c9cabe6c8","head":{"label":"bersprockets:using_oddity2","ref":"using_oddity2","sha":"4dec00f55e5571a6d215a16dcdfde77c9cabe6c8","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to upgrade rocksdbjni from 8.1.1.1 to 8.3.2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe release notes: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v8.3.2\r\n- Bug Fixes\r\nReduced cases of illegally using Env::Default() during static destruction by never destroying the internal PosixEnv itself (except for builds checking for memory leaks). (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/11538)\r\n\r\n- Performance Improvements\r\nFixed higher read QPS during DB::Open() reading files created prior to https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/11406, especially when reading many small file (size < 52 MB) during DB::Open() and partitioned filter or index is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Manual test: `org.apache.spark.util.kvstore.RocksDBBenchmark`\r\n\r\n**A.8.1.1.1**\r\n```\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a class that will manage all of the SSH environment changes that may occur when running a distributed application. Is important for when the proposed application may require altering the existing ssh configurations. This class helps by both saving the old state, as well as cleaning up all temporary files created by the SSH Environment Manager. This is planned to be used in the Deepspeed Distributor Class that will follow and is only meant to be used as a utility function.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHelps restore SSH

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe plan on adding two new tokens called ```namedArgumentExpression``` and ```functionArgument``` which would enable this feature. When parsing this logic, we also make changes to ASTBuilder such that it can detect if the argument passed is a named argument or a positional one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is part of a larger project to implement named parameter support for user defined functions, built-in functions, and table valued functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the user would be able to call functions with argument lists that contain named arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWe add tests in the PlanParserSuite that will verify that the plan parsed is as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRefactors `PythonUDTFRunner` to send its return type separately.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe return type of Python UDTF doesn't need to be included in the Python \"command\" because `PythonUDTF` knows the return type. It can send the return type separately.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated the related tests and existing

While Kafka can already be used to connect to MSK, this PR introduces IAM support. This should solve customer pain points as in https://github.com/aws/aws-msk-iam-auth/issues/115. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhile Kafka can already be used to connect to MSK, this PR introduces IAM support. This should solve customer pain points as in https://github.com/aws/aws-msk-iam-auth/issues/115. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, customers can now use the configs like \r\n```\r\n--conf spark.kafka.clusters.${cluster}.kafka.security.protocol=SASL_SSL\r\n    --conf spark.kafka.clusters.${cluster}.kafka.sasl.mechanism=AWS_MSK_IAM\r\n    --conf spark.kafka.clusters.${cluster}.kafka.sasl.jaas.config=software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMLoginModule required;\r\n    --conf spark.kafka.clusters.${cluster}.kafka.sasl.client.callback.handler.class=software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMClientCallbackHandler\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTesting is challenging since there's no easy to mock AWS locally for testing IAM. Instead we test that a specific error is thrown in various scenarios to validate that the library is discoverable. This has also been manually tested.\r\n\r\nThe stackPR for the timeout is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis is for source-side errors;\r\n```\r\n[info] - test MSK IAM auth on kafka 'source and stream' side *** FAILED *** (14 seconds, 971 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQueryException: [STREAM_FAILED] Query [id = 536052c3-968d-49d4-8196-34606826a6e6, runId = 8f342aff-62bb-49ac-a8c7-d81dc4b34252] terminated with exception: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for a node assignment.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn KafkaBatchInputPartition, which is used for Kafka v2 source, preferredLocations() is now returned from the location already pre-calculated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDSv2 Kafka streaming source seems to miss setting the preferred location, which may destroy the purpose of cache for Kafka consumer (connection) & fetched data. For DSv1, we have set the preferred location in RDD. This information is not returned in DSv2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nSome manual

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes zero when io.connectionTimeout/connectionCreationTimeout is negative. Zero here means \r\n- connectionCreationTimeout = 0，an unlimited CONNNETION_TIMEOUT for connection establishment\r\n- connectionTimeout=0， `IdleStateHandler` for triggering `IdleStateEvent` is disabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. This PR fixes a bug when connectionCreationTimeout is 0, which means unlimited to netty, but ChannelFuture.await(0) fails directly and inappropriately.\r\n2. This PR fixes a bug when connectionCreationTimeout is less than 0, which causes meaningless transport client reconnections and endless executor reconstructions\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a memory reserve policy for WritableColumnVector:\r\n* If the vector capacity < VECTORIZED_HUGE_VECTOR_THRESHOLD, will reserve requested capacity * 2 memory.\r\n* If the vector capacity >= VECTORIZED_HUGE_VECTOR_THRESHOLD, will reserve requested capacity * VECTORIZED_HUGE_VECTOR_RESERVE_RATIO memory.\r\n* Free the WritableColumnVector memory if the vector capacity >= VECTORIZED_HUGE_VECTOR_THRESHOLD\r\n\r\nwhich will reuse the allocated array object for small column vectors and free the memory for huge column vectors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen spark reads a data file into a WritableColumnVector, the memory allocated by the WritableColumnVectors is not freed until the VectorizedColumnReader completes.\r\n\r\nIt will save memory allocation time by reusing the allocated array objects. But it also takes up too many unused memory after the current large vector batch has been read.\r\n\r\nAdd a memory reserve policy for this scenario which will reuse the allocated array object for small column vectors and free the memory for huge column vectors.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/3626747/a7a487bd-f184-4b24-bea0-75e530702887)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/3626747/01d0268f-68e7-416f-b9b3-6c9d60919596)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR will add the new class `DeepspeedDistributor`. This class will use the deepspeed launcher to run distributed (and local) deepspeed applications. This PR focuses on basic boilerplate + infrastructure. Some tasks accomplished:\r\n\r\n1. Get all of the worker nodes\r\n2. Find and write the number of slots of each worker node to the Deepspeed hostfile\r\n3. Be able to create the deepspeed command for a pytorch training file and run it using deepspeed. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nUnit tests coming soon\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\nThe next step in the project will be to enable distributed training when a picklable training function is passed in. The current plan is to refactor the TorchDistributor code to take in a function pointer, which will be the function invoked. We can then utilize this to pass in the Deepspeed Distributor's run_from_pytorch_file function, which will then allow distributed training of deepspeed training function.\r\n\r\n### Important Things to Note\r\n\r\n- The user must already have setup the ssh environment (distributed the public keys to the workers, added ssh keys to the authorized_hosts file, etc.\r\n- The user must have nvidia-smi enabled in order for Deepspeed to fetch the GPU metrics from worker nodes in the cluster.\r\n\r\n### PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Get the number of GPUs on workers\r\n- [x] Create the deepspeed command\r\n- [x] Be able to run a distributed PyTorch training file using deepspeed\r\n- [ ] Unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-28T23:57:41Z","updated_at":"2023-07-11T22:55:38Z","closed_at":"2023-07-11T22:55:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"108dc9e15f0ab044a1647806e02425077ca682ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41778/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41778/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41778/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/37345571078fb85998d414c96ed0a780ef5d0b1c","head":{"label":"mathewjacob1002:deepspeed_launcher","ref":"deepspeed_launcher","sha":"37345571078fb85998d414c96ed0a780ef5d0b1c","user":{"login":"mathewjacob1002","id":134338709,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAHYlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134338709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002","html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":659420972,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ033LA","name":"spark","full_name":"mathewjacob1002/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mathewjacob1002","id":134338709,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAHYlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134338709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002","html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a config for a long-standing feature that we will automatically refresh query result cache if the referenced tables get updated. This allows people to turn off the config and control how soon to refresh the query result cache by manually executing the REFRESH TABLE command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSometimes it's very useful to disable auto cache refresh if it's OK to have a bit of staleness of the data, as refreshing the cache means re-running the query, which can be expensive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplemented a distributed learning class meant for deepspeed workloads using the torch.distributed.run command. Also made some tests for some of the functions. Need to add tests for the distributed workloads in the create_torchrun_command. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpecial commands are needed for deepspeed workloads. This class makes it easier to run the deepspeed applications without ever needing to touch the terminal. If a user needs to use the torch.distributed.run launcher, this class will let them do that. This class also has a very similar API and workflow to the TorchDistributor class, where you simply create an instance and then invoke distributor.run(...).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] creates

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `grpc` from `1.48.1` to `1.56.0` for Apache Spark 3.5.0.\r\n\r\n- https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.56.0/ (Released: Jun 22, 2023)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- To support `Python 3.11` because `grpcio` starts to support `Python 3.11` from `1.49.1`.\r\n  - https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.49.1/\r\n\r\n- To use `1.56.0` consistently because we used previously two versions; `1.48.1` and `1.47.0`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cd486070bf4f2b8f1fa54ba6690cce0955af351/pom.xml#L283\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cd486070bf4f2b8f1fa54ba6690cce0955af351/dev/requirements.txt#L53\r\n\r\n- Use `plugin` instead of deactivated `remote`.\r\n  - https://buf.build/grpc/plugins/python (It stopped at `v1.51.1-1`)\r\n  - https://buf.build/grpc/plugins/ruby (It also stopped at `v1.51.1-1`)\r\n\r\n- To fix a typo in `install.rst` from `grpc` to `grpcio`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cd486070bf4f2b8f1fa54ba6690cce0955af351/python/docs/source/getting_started/install.rst?plain=1#L162\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is a dependency change, but `connect` module itself is still experimental.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

request?\r\n`Dataset.selectExpr` are covered by withActive, to scope Session.active.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n[SPARK-30798](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30798) mentioned  all SparkSession dataset methods should covered by withActive, but `selectExpr` not.\r\nFor example：\r\n```\r\n val clone = spark.cloneSession()\r\nclone.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.interval.enabled\", \"true\")\r\n// sql1\r\nclone.sql(\"select '2023-01-01'+ INTERVAL 1 YEAR as b\").show()\r\n// sql2\r\nclone.sql(\"select '2023-01-01' as a\").selectExpr(\"a + INTERVAL 1 YEAR as b\").show() \r\n```\r\nsql1 can be executed successfully, sql2 failed.\r\nError message:\r\n```\r\n[DATATYPE_MISMATCH.BINARY_OP_DIFF_TYPES]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add:\r\n\r\n- `SparkContext.setInterruptOnCancel(interruptOnCancel: Boolean): Unit`\r\n- `SparkContext.addJobTag(tag: String): Unit`\r\n- `SparkContext.removeJobTag(tag: String): Unit`\r\n- `SparkContext.getJobTags(): Set[String]`\r\n- `SparkContext.clearJobTags(): Unit`\r\n- `SparkContext.cancelJobsWithTag(tag: String): Unit`\r\n\r\ninto Java API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor Java users. In addition, these will be used in Python implementation in SPARK-44194\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds new API in Java.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt's an alias so no tests added. These will be at least called once via PySpark when I work on SPARK-44194 so I don't worry about it too much.","created_at":"2023-06-27T01:12:04Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:04Z","closed_at":"2023-06-27T04:41:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"23766a1c08e42183336c11463ed3465746038191","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41753/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41753/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41753/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/43b669871a33da2ad28f32726d5f1c392ed456c7","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-44202","ref":"SPARK-44202","sha":"43b669871a33da2ad28f32726d5f1c392ed456c7","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
