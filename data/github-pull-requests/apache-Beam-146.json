continuation mode was always-on by mistake. Also, continuation mode would\r\narbitrarily nest appended state via iterators which would lead to the following\r\nerror:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case of continuations tokens, we do not cache anything anymore after the\r\ncontinuation. Caching after the continuation token would defeat the purpose of\r\nusing continuation tokens for large state. A test was added for continuation\r\ntokens.\r\n\r\nThe extend operation was removed from the statecache in favor of using only\r\nput/get/clear which avoids any race conditions with the cache eviction.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

support for the StringUTF8 beam coder to the Go SDK.\r\nThis is functionally how strings were encoded before, but now we use the standard URN rather than a custom coder to wrap it.\r\n\r\n* This PR also changes harness Bundle Descriptor Plan errors to put the root error first and then have all the PB proto print outs afterwards which makes those errors easier to read.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

when a mismatch of the dimensions emitted by the DoFn and the dimensions emitted by the ParDo was encountered, a less than helpful message of  `expected 1 output. Found: []` was returned. This caused some confusion especially when paired with ParDo and ParDo0 which may be counterintuitive arrangement to most.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we provide a more helpful error message which correctly reference the DoFn which has the misalignment and the ParDo which the misalignment of dimensions were captured by. It also recommends a ParDo function which may be used by the DoFn in question.\r\n\r\nWe introduce two new functions to the pardo package as well as a new function to the reflectx package to help us construct this error message.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

If I only include highlight tabs for the ones with current instructions (Direct, Dataflow, and Spark) then the entire runner-switcher under \"Run WordCount Using Gradle\" disappears if a user clicks on another runner option under \"Run WordCount Using Maven\". I thought it would make more sense to include the others as placeholders and just mark them as to be added so the whole switcher does not disappear and it's clear where the instruction will be added in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

 RowJson.java doesn't have support for deserialising JSON with fields missing - it fails, even if the beam schema is nullable. This is often a problem for reading JSON as nulls are very commonly represented by omitting the field. Additionally, for this reason, not writing nulls is a reasonable when converting from Beam rows to JSON.\r\n\r\nThis would help to allow https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7624 to be implemented. \r\n\r\nThis commit attempts to add support for this type of implicit nulls.\r\n\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow | Flink | Gearpump | Samza | Spark\r\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

PR improves Beam's parameterized type hint coverage by adding support for Python's frozenset container. Type annotations should now work with frozenset, typing.FrozenSet, and typehints.FrozenSet. \r\n\r\nThe same level of unit test coverage that exists for set has been added for frozenset. When possible, similar tests were refactored via inheritance to support both set and frozenset to make the code extensible and reduce code duplication.\r\n\r\nThe website documentation [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-type-safety/) has been updated to reflect these changes.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

runner heavily uses MetricKey.toString() and MetricName.toString() to update Samza metrics. We found that the toString methods have high CPU cost. And according to this article: https://redfin.engineering/java-string-concatenation-which-way-is-best-8f590a7d22a8, we should use \"+\" operator instead of String.format for string concatenation for better performance.\r\n\r\nWe do see about 10% QPS gain in nexmark queries using Samza runner with the change of using \"+\" operator.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
