brings in operators that wrap certain BLAS3 and LAPACK routines in particular\r\ntrsm\r\ntrmm\r\npotrf\r\npotri\r\ngemm\r\n\r\n(in addition a 2-operator version of gemm and an operator for getting the sum of logs of a matrix diagonal).\r\nThe goal is to bring in enough operators in order to support specific commonly important applications, for example Gaussian Processes. With this set of operators, it is possible to\r\n- Use MxNet as a computing framework for lot of Gaussian Process work\r\n- Develop new applications that combine neural networks and Gaussian processes\r\n\r\nAn example was given at AMLC. There is a lot of active work ongoing in this area. In addition, there are other groups that are interested specifically in the Cholesky factorization (potrf). \r\n\r\n All operators provide proper backward gradients such that they can be integrated easily into custom loss-layers of neural networks. Getting gradients is nontrivial specifically for matrix factorization, so this PR is  more than a simple wrapper around linear algebra routines. \r\n\r\nThis PR defines a framework into which we can add other LAPACK/BLAS-related operators in the future. \r\n\r\nThe plan is to first release these CPU versions and afterwards bring in the GPU ones (we are already working on that). Based on the outcome of the GPU work \r\n\r\nThe documentation for the operators is in line with the most recent general doc-updates (verified the layout on a local

trying to use the **caffe_converter** on **bvlc_googlenet** I came across a bug in the conversion process which failed it. I've fix the bug, and used **test_converter** to check the performance of the converted model.\r\n\r\nI added support for running the **test_converter** on CPU, and also fixed a bug related to **resnet-*** conversion which also failed converting.\r\n\r\nLastly, I've noticed the performance comparison done in **test_converter** allows for an additive 30% reduction (!) in accuracy performance in the converted model. I suspect the original intent is to allow a 3% drop in performance. The actual performance drop measured was ranging between 0% and 1.6% on the three models tested (bvlc_googlenet, vgg-16, resnet-50).\r\n\r\nFollowing are related issues:\r\n- #6441 - can be closed after this merge\r\n- #6319 - the converter still doesn't support networks with multiple outputs in the final deployment, but it does support now network **trained** with multiple outputs (like bvlc_googlenet). In short, the problem encountered in this issue is resolved, but its title is not accurate.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-30T15:49:28Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T16:41:41Z","closed_at":"2017-06-06T16:41:40Z","merged_at":"2017-06-06T16:41:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"59781868b8753aa407e07759f12ef8a04b4cd291","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3ea7343d05a34c765b9d04c379491a53f2c0ce7e","head":{"label":"arikpoz:master","ref":"master","sha":"3ea7343d05a34c765b9d04c379491a53f2c0ce7e","user":{"login":"arikpoz","id":9167746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjc3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9167746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz","html_url":"https://github.com/arikpoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92770955,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Mjc3MDk1NQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"arikpoz/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arikpoz","id":9167746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjc3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9167746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz","html_url":"https://github.com/arikpoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arikpoz/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR does the same as dmlc/dmlc-core#257 but for mxnet. It uses `GNUInstallDirs.cmake` for standard (but overridable) installation locations for different types of files. Additionally, it uses plain CMake `install()` instead of custom targets that copy files around.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it prevents leaking `mxnet_static` and the flags ` \"-Wl,--whole-archive $<TARGET_FILE:mxnet_static> -Wl,--no-whole-archive\"` into `INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` of `mxnet` by marking them as private.\r\n\r\nIt also sets the output name of `mxnet_static` to `mxnet` to let CMake handle the output name rather than symlinking to `mxnet_static.a`.","created_at":"2017-05-28T13:18:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-10T07:15:21Z","closed_at":"2017-09-10T07:15:21Z","merged_at":"2017-09-10T07:15:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c2c1f552ec36abeeddafcd7ff286bad25397984","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b92dafdea7f05766892623e41f882a9f0345ddfa","head":{"label":"fizyr-forks:install-targets","ref":"install-targets","sha":"b92dafdea7f05766892623e41f882a9f0345ddfa","user":{"login":"fizyr-forks","id":21259075,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMjU5MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21259075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/fizyr-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92513181,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjUxMzE4MQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"fizyr-forks/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fizyr-forks","id":21259075,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMjU5MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21259075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/fizyr-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fizyr-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fizyr-forks/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

this PR I add additional type of optimizer MultiPrecisionSGD, which takes 16-bit weights and gradients, but internally keeps a 32-bit master copy of the weights and uses it to increase the precision of the update. It is the approach that was used in the alexnet and resnet-v1 fp16 examples using explicit casts, but it achieves better performance by omitting storing and loading casted values from memory. \r\nI also simplified alexnet and resnet-v1 fp16 examples by removing explicit casts - they are now intended to be used with the proposed MultiPrecisionSGD optimizer.","created_at":"2017-05-24T20:46:00Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T15:27:59Z","closed_at":"2017-06-21T23:35:39Z","merged_at":"2017-06-21T23:35:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4c7bfcf4305fde55aa309782bf007a6c19fd5a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6428/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6428/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6428/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/8d6dca4e2a0c45659d12874bb5e3fbde896dd7e3","head":{"label":"ptrendx:multi_precision_pr","ref":"multi_precision_pr","sha":"8d6dca4e2a0c45659d12874bb5e3fbde896dd7e3","user":{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76683609,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjY4MzYwOQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"ptrendx/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
