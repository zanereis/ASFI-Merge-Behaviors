What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- This PR instead of calling `conf.resolver` for each call in `resolveExpression`, reuses the `resolver` obtained once.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Consider a view with large number of columns (~1000s). When looking at the RuleExecutor metrics and flamegraph for a query that only does `DESCRIBE SELECT * FROM large_view`, observed that a large fraction of time is spent in `ResolveReferences` and `ResolveRelations`. Of these, the majority of the driver time went in initializing the `conf` to obtain `conf.resolver` for each of the column in the view.\r\n- Since, the same `conf` is used in each of these calls, calling the `conf.resolver` again and again can be avoided by initializing it once and reusing the same resolver.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Created a dummy view with 3000 columns.\r\n- Observed the `RuleExecutor` metrics using `RuleExecutor.dumpTimeSpent()`.\r\n- `RuleExecutor` metrics before this change (after multiple runs)\r\n```\r\n=== Metrics of Analyzer/Optimizer Rules ===\r\nTotal number of runs: 1483\r\nTotal time: 8.026801698 seconds\r\n\r\nRule

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change covers tests for streaming operations under columns of string type that are collated with non-utf8-binary collations. PR introduces following tests:\r\n1) Non-stateful streaming for non-binary collated columns. We use `UTF8_BINARY_LCASE` non-binary collation as the input and assert that streaming propagates collation and that filtering behaves under rules of given collation.\r\n2) Stateful streaming for binary collations. We use `UNICODE` collation as source and make sure that stateful operations (deduplication as taken as the example) work.\r\n3) More tests that assert that stateful operations in combination with non-binary collations throw proper exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nYou can find more information about collation effort in document attached to root jira ticket.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for basic non-stateful streaming operations with collations (e.g. filtering).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPR is test only.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to:\r\n- add `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` to `JavaModuleOptions`\r\n- remove `jdk.incubator.foreign` and `-Dforeign.restricted=warn` from `SparkBuild.scala`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.`jdk.incubator.vector`\r\nFirst introduction: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30810\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30810/files#diff-6f545c33f2fcc975200bf208c900a600a593ce6b170180f81e2f93b3efb6cb3e\r\n<img width=\"1045\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/6ac7919a-5d82-475c-b8a2-7d9de71acacc\">\r\n\r\nWhy should we add `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` to `JavaModuleOptions`,\r\nBecause when we only add `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` to `SparkBuild.scala`, it will only take effect when compiling, as follows:\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"mllib-local/Test/runMain org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.BLASBenchmark\"\r\n...\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"619\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/54d5f55f-cefe-4126-b255-69488f8699a6\">\r\n\r\nHowever, when we use `spark-submit`, it is as follows:\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.BLASBenchmark /Users/panbingkun/Developer/spark/spark-community/mllib-local/target/scala-2.13/spark-mllib-local_2.13-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1399\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/8e02fa93-fef4-4cdc-96bd-908b3e9baea1\">\r\n\r\nObviously, `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` does not take effect in the `Spark runtime`, so I propose adding `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` to the `JavaModuleOptions`(`Spark runtime options`) so that we can improve `performance` by using `hardware-accelerated BLAS operations` by default.\r\n\r\nAfter this patch(add `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` to the `JavaModuleOptions`), as follows:\r\n<img width=\"1399\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/da7aa494-0d3c-4c60-9991-e7cd29a1cec5\">\r\n\r\n2.`jdk.incubator.foreign` and `-Dforeign.restricted=warn`\r\nA.First introduction: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32253\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32253/files#diff-6f545c33f2fcc975200bf208c900a600a593ce6b170180f81e2f93b3efb6cb3e\r\n<img width=\"1041\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/3f526019-c389-4e60-ab2a-7777f8e99cfb\">\r\nUse `dev.ludovic.netlib:blas:1.3.2`, the class `ForeignLinkerBLAS` uses `jdk.incubator.foreign.*` in this version, so we need to add `jdk.incubator.foreign` and `-Dforeign.restricted=warn` to `SparkBuild.scala`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32253/files#diff-9c5fb3d1b7e3b0f54bc5c4182965c4fe1f9023d449017cece3005d3f90e8e4d8\r\n<img width=\"497\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/4fd35e96-0da2-4456-a3f6-6b57ad2e9b64\">\r\nhttps://github.com/luhenry/netlib/blob/v1.3.2/blas/src/main/java/dev/ludovic/netlib/blas/ForeignLinkerBLAS.java#L36\r\n<img width=\"743\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/4b7e3bd1-4650-4c7d-bdb4-c1761d48d478\">\r\n\r\nHowever, with the iterative development of `dev.ludovic.netlib`, `ForeignLinkerBLAS` has experienced one `major` change, as following:\r\nhttps://github.com/luhenry/netlib/commit/48e923c3e5e84560139eb25b3c9df9873c05e41d\r\n<img width=\"452\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/7ba30b19-00c7-4cc4-bea7-a6ab4b326ad8\">\r\nFrom now on (V3.0.0), `jdk.incubator.foreign.*` will not be used in `dev.ludovic.netlib`\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark has used the `dev.ludovic.netlib` of version `v3.0.3`. In this version, `ForeignLinkerBLAS` has be removed.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/pom.xml#L191\r\n\r\nDouble check (`jdk.incubator.foreign` cannot be found in the `netlib` source code):\r\n<img width=\"674\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/5c6c6d73-6a5d-427a-9fb4-f626f02335ca\">\r\n\r\nSo we can completely remove options `jdk.incubator.foreign` and `-Dforeign.restricted=warn`.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.For JDK 21\r\n(PS: This is to explain the historical reasons for the differences between the current code logic and the initial ones)\r\n(Just because `Spark` made changes to support `JDK 21`)\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44088\r\n<img width=\"1350\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes Spark Connect to support defining and registering `Aggregator[IN, BUF, OUT]` UDAFs.\r\nThe mechanism is similar to supporting Scaler UDFs. On the client side, we serialize and send the `Aggregator` instance to the server, where the data is deserialized into an `Aggregator` instance recognized by Spark Core.\r\nWith this PR we now have two `Aggregator` interfaces defined, one in Connect API and one in Core. They define exactly the same abstract methods and share the same `SerialVersionUID`, so the Java serialization engine could map one to another. It is very important to keep these two definitions always in sync.\r\n\r\nSecond part of this effort will be adding `Aggregator.toColumn` API (now NotImplemented due to deps to Spark Core).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark Connect does not have UDAF support. We need to fix that.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, Connect users could now define an Aggregator and register it:\r\n```scala\r\nval agg = new Aggregator[INT, INT, INT] { ... }\r\nspark.udf.register(\"agg\", udaf(agg))\r\nval ds: Dataset[Data] = ...\r\nval aggregated = ds.selectExpr(\"agg(i)\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr adds a new trait `WriteFilesExecBase` for v1 write, so that the downstream project can inherit `WriteFilesExecBase` rather than `WriteFilesExec`. The reason is that, inherit a `case class` is a bad practice in scala world.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass CI\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `datatimeoffset -> StringType` mapping to `datatimeoffset -> TimestampType` mapping as we use `mssql-jdbc` for Microsoft SQL Server. `spark.sql.legacy.mssqlserver.datetimeoffsetMapping.enabled` is provided for user to restore the old behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the official SQL Server client, it's more reasonable to read it as TimestampType, which is also much more compliant with other jdbc datasources\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, (please refer to the first section)\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe private implicit function `arrayToArrayWritable` was introduced alongside other implicit functions such as `rddToPairRDDExtras`, `rddToSequencePairRDDExtras`, `intToIntWritable`, etc., in the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/38f2ba99cc32584f0645f3875f051516b4b738d2. Apart from `arrayToArrayWritable`, the other implicit functions were deprecated in SPARK-4397 and SPARK-4795, and subsequently removed in SPARK-12615. `arrayToArrayWritable` remained as a leftover private implicit function from that time, but it is currently no longer being used. Therefore, this PR removes it from SparkContext.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up useless code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-04-26T06:49:33Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T07:34:36Z","closed_at":"2024-04-26T07:33:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67d6530e1757328fd04a44c23493f216aea517f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7291886a21f4ac3a705cafd5324e9bc1cd2b14f0","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:remove-arrayToArrayWritable","ref":"remove-arrayToArrayWritable","sha":"7291886a21f4ac3a705cafd5324e9bc1cd2b14f0","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Python UDTF DataFrame API to return the result of calling the 'analyze' method as the output table, instead of the 'eval' and 'terminate' methods.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval udtfRunAnalyzeMethod: UserDefinedPythonTableFunction =\r\n  udtf.copy(returnResultOfAnalyzeMethod = true)\r\nval df = udtfRunAnalyzeMethod(spark, lit(\"abc\"))\r\n  .select(\"schema\")\r\n  .collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should return the 'analyze' method result schema, with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"schema\": {\r\n    \"fields\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"metadata\": {},\r\n        \"name\": \"partition_col\",\r\n        \"nullable\": true,\r\n        \"type\": \"integer\"\r\n      },\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR I propose a change in QueryBuilder for SQLServer. This change modifies push down of predicate that contains a column that is generated with a CASE WHEN construct, so that we add simple ` = 1` comparison to this query, making it work on SQLServer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSQLServer does not support 0 or 1 as a boolean values. There are certain situations where spark optimizer rewrites filters that contain CASE WHEN columns in a way that adds 1 or 0 as a boolean values, which fails on SQLServer side with an error \"An expression of non-boolean type specified in a context where a condition is expected\". With these changes, we modify pushing this filters down, and error is no longer present. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA new test case is added, which fails without these changes.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-25T16:04:12Z","updated_at":"2024-04-29T11:42:23Z","closed_at":"2024-04-29T11:42:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a74cf89ebc26b59bd41360262869fe2f9fcc8766","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"milastdbx","id":150366084,"node_id":"U_kgDOCPZnhA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150366084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx","html_url":"https://github.com/milastdbx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milastdbx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/defef9f0b33e2eea80baf9acd153cc4a8aa3383c","head":{"label":"stefanbuk-db:SQLServer_case_when_bugfix","ref":"SQLServer_case_when_bugfix","sha":"defef9f0b33e2eea80baf9acd153cc4a8aa3383c","user":{"login":"stefanbuk-db","id":161319309,"node_id":"U_kgDOCZ2JjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161319309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanbuk-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":765608789,"node_id":"R_kgDOLaJDVQ","name":"spark","full_name":"stefanbuk-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stefanbuk-db","id":161319309,"node_id":"U_kgDOCZ2JjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161319309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanbuk-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/recei

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to drop Python 3.8 in PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython 3.8 is EOL in this October (https://devguide.python.org/versions/). Assuming from the release schedule for Spark 4, I think it's better to drop it now before we do it after branchcut, etc.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the broken scheduled build (https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8818780802)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it drops Python 3.8 support.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes will be tested through CI.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-25T11:58:33Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T08:20:01Z","closed_at":"2024-04-26T08:20:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32a8f49a577fcb54fc159dc48eac5993cbb122ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46228/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46228/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46228/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3560fa57ac4684646ca503de8154963b4ccb38b","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-47993","ref":"SPARK-47993","sha":"a3560fa57ac4684646ca503de8154963b4ccb38b","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- convert `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` to `SparkArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\r\n- refactor `CollationFactory` to extract some of the same logic into a method, reduce redundancy.\r\n- when calling `String#toUpperCase()` with parameters `Locale.ROOT`, which conforms to the traditional rules of Spark, as follows:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/scalastyle-config.xml#L247-L258\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"image\"

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nConvert `INTERNAL_ERROR` for `timestampAdd` and `timestampDiff` to error with class. Reusing `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE.DATETIME_UNIT` used when parsing expressions.\r\n\r\nThe change is needed since `timestampDiff` and `timestampAdd` expressions could be constructed without going through parser - e.g. PySpark creates `timestampDiff` through PythonSQLUtils.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to switch `spark.sql.legacy.createHiveTableByDefault` to `false` by default in order to move away from this legacy behavior from `Apache Spark 4.0.0` while the legacy functionality will be preserved during Apache Spark 4.x period by setting `spark.sql.legacy.createHiveTableByDefault=true`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHistorically, this behavior change was merged at `Apache Spark 3.0.0` activity in SPARK-30098 and reverted officially during the `3.0.0 RC` period.\r\n\r\n- 2019-12-06: #26736 (58be82a)\r\n- 2019-12-06: https://lists.apache.org/thread/g90dz1og1zt4rr5h091rn1zqo50y759j\r\n- 2020-05-16: #28517\r\n\r\nAt `Apache Spark 3.1.0`, we had another discussion and defined it as `Legacy` behavior via a new configuration by reusing the JIRA ID, SPARK-30098.\r\n- 2020-12-01: https://lists.apache.org/thread/8c8k1jk61pzlcosz3mxo4rkj5l23r204\r\n- 2020-12-03: #30554\r\n\r\nLast year, this was proposed again twice and `Apache Spark 4.0.0` is a good time to make a decision for Apache Spark future direction.\r\n- SPARK-42603 on 2023-02-27 as an independent idea.\r\n- SPARK-46122 on 2023-11-27 as a part of Apache Spark 4.0.0 idea\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the migration document is updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the adjusted test cases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-24T16:59:19Z","updated_at":"2024-04-30T08:45:04Z","closed_at":"2024-04-30T08:44:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a063664be8100e0096aa11a875d6d49946c9c7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29d1be568f0e058cc2d85dea0759c92b0d49166d","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-46122","ref":"SPARK-46122","sha":"29d1be568f0e058cc2d85dea0759c92b0d49166d","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

[original PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45749) because code has been reorganized in [this PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45978).\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is created to add support for collations to StringTrim family of functions/expressions, specifically:\r\n- `StringTrim`\r\n- `StringTrimBoth`\r\n- `StringTrimLeft`\r\n- `StringTrimRight`\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- `CollationSupport.java`\r\n  - Add new `StringTrim`, `StringTrimLeft` and `StringTrimRight` classes with corresponding logic.\r\n  - `CollationAwareUTF8String` - add new `trim`, `trimLeft` and `trimRight` methods that actually implement trim logic.\r\n- `UTF8String.java` - expose some of the methods publicly.\r\n- `stringExpressions.scala`\r\n  - Change input types.\r\n  - Change eval and code gen logic.\r\n- `CollationTypeCasts.scala` - add `StringTrim*` expressions to `CollationTypeCasts` rules.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are incrementally adding collation support to a built-in string functions in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes:\r\n- User should now be able to use non-default collations in string trim functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAlready existing tests + new unit/e2e tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-24T16:21:09Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T15:05:28Z","closed_at":"2024-05-09T15:05:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"458c90664bfe4c9f8f09b1125bda1f11e9b2c4e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/993c2e2d79faa4748738af8333914dafb64d94fb","head":{"label":"davidm-db:string-trim-functions","ref":"string-trim-functions","sha":"993c2e2d79faa4748738af8333914dafb64d94fb","user":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":775065390,"node_id":"R_kgDOLjKPLg","name":"spark","full_name":"davidm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to make `the external Spark ecosystem` can use `structured logging mechanisms`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the class of MDC's key is `LogKey`, while LogKey is an `enumeration`. If we want to use structured logging mechanism in a `third-party Spark ecosystem`, we cannot currently use it (we cannot expand and `add a new LogKey enumeration value`)\r\nSo I propose changing the `LogKey` from `enumeration` to the following, \r\n<img width=\"550\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/ffb0f41e-4f2c-4537-b43f-d55353fe03f7\">\r\nas we already have a similar way of writing it in the Spark code,

user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT (Give an example to developers who use the LogKey mechanism in external systems related to Spark.)\r\n- Manually

is a backport of #45763 to branch-3.5.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nModify `LateralJoin` to include right-side plan output in `allAttributes`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the view v1 is cached, but a query of v1 does not use the cache:\r\n```\r\nCREATE or REPLACE TEMP VIEW t1(c1, c2) AS VALUES (0, 1), (1, 2);\r\nCREATE or REPLACE TEMP VIEW t2(c1, c2) AS VALUES (0, 1), (1, 2);\r\n\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1 as\r\nselect *\r\nfrom t1\r\njoin lateral (\r\n  select c1 as a, c2 as b\r\n  from t2)\r\non c1 = a;\r\n\r\ncache table v1;\r\n\r\nexplain select * from v1;\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- BroadcastHashJoin [c1#180], [a#173], Inner, BuildRight, false\r\n   :- LocalTableScan [c1#180, c2#181]\r\n   +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(cast(input[0, int, false] as bigint)),false), [plan_id=113]\r\n      +- LocalTableScan [a#173, b#174]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe canonicalized version of the `LateralJoin` node is not consistent when there is a join condition. For example, for the above query, the join condition is canonicalized as follows:\r\n```\r\nBefore canonicalization: Some((c1#174 = a#167))\r\nAfter canonicalization:  Some((none#0 = none#167))\r\n```\r\nYou can see that the `exprId` for the second operand of `EqualTo` is not normalized (it remains 167). That's because the attribute `a` from the right-side plan is not included `allAttributes`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds right-side attributes to `allAttributes` so that references to right-side attributes in the join condition are normalized during canonicalization.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

currently capture metrics which include the number of files, bytes and rows for a task along with the updated partitions. \r\n This change captures metrics for each updated partition, reporting the partition sub-paths along with the number of files, bytes, and rows per partition for each task.\r\n\r\nThis is the V1 implementation, extracted from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45123\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Update the `WriteTaskStatsTracker` implementation to associate a partition with the file during writing, and to track the number of rows written to each file.  The final stats now include a map of partitions and the associated partition stats\r\n2. Update the `WriteJobStatsTracker` implementation to capture the partition subpaths and to publish a new Event to the listener bus.  The processed stats aggregate the statistics for each partition\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis increases our understanding of written data by tracking the impact for each task on our datasets\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis makes partition-level data accessible through a new event.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIn addition to the new unit tests, this was run in a Kubernetes environment writing tables with differing partitioning strategies and validating the reported stats.  Unit tests using both `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` and `InsertIntoHiveTable` now verify partition stats when dynamic partitioning is enabled.  We also verified that the aggregated partition metrics matched the existing metrics for number of files, bytes, and rows.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanging to call `reviveOffers` on start (after the local executor is set up) so that the task scheduler knows about it. This matches behavior in CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend, which will call an equivalent method on executor registration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen using LocalSchedulerBackend, the task scheduler will not know about the executor until a task is run, which can lead to unexpected behavior in tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRunning existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `DeduplicateRelations` rule can be very slow on large plans due to the `missingInput` check on the whole plan, which was introduced by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37932 / https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35684.\r\nThis PR proposes to reduce scope of the check to only those areas of the plan that can be deduplicated. This PR contains a small improvement to `QueryPlan.inputSet()` as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPerformance improvement.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Add configuration `spark.connect.grpc.port.maxRetries` (default 0, no retries).\r\n\r\n   [Before this PR]: The SparkConnectService would fail to start in case of port conflicts on Yarn.\r\n   [After this PR]: Allow the internal GRPC server to retry new ports until it finds an available port before reaching the maxRetries.\r\n\r\n2. Post SparkListenerEvent containing the location of the remote SparkConnectService on Yarn.\r\n\r\n   [Before this PR]: We needed to manually find the final location (host and port) of the SparkConnectService on Yarn and then use the SparkConnect Client to connect.\r\n   [After this PR]: The location will be posted via SparkListenerEvent\r\n                                                  `SparkListenerConnectServiceStarted`\r\n                                                  `SparkListenerConnectServiceEnd`\r\n Allowing users to register a listener to receive this event and expose it by some way like sending it to a third coordinator server.\r\n\r\n3. Shutdown SparkPlugins before stopping the ListenerBus.\r\n\r\n   [Before this PR]: If the SparkConnectService was launched in the SparkConnectPlugin way, currently the SparkPlugins would be shutdown after the stop of ListenerBus, causing events posted during the shutdown to not be delivered to the listener.\r\n   [After this PR]: The SparkPlugins will be shutdown before the stop of ListenerBus, ensuring that the ListenerBus remains active during the shutdown and the listener can receive the SparkConnectService stop event.\r\n\r\n4. Minor method refactoring for 1~3.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n#User Story:\r\nOur data analysts and data scientists use Jupyter notebooks provisioned on Kubernetes (k8s) with limited CPU/memory resources to run Spark-shell/pyspark for interactively development via terminal under Yarn Client mode.\r\n\r\nHowever, Yarn Client mode consumes significant local memory if the job is heavy, and the total resource pool of k8s for notebooks is limited.\r\n\r\nTo leverage the abundant resources of our Hadoop cluster for scalability purposes, we aim to utilize SparkConnect.\r\nThis allows the driver on Yarn with SparkConnectService started and uses SparkConnect client to connect to the remote driver.\r\n\r\nTo provide a seamless experience with one command startup for both server and client, we've wrapped the following processes in one script:\r\n\r\n1) Start a local coordinator server (implemented by us internally, not in this PR) in the host of jupyter notebook.\r\n2) Start SparkConnectServer by spark-submit via Yarn Cluster mode with user-input Spark configurations and the local coordinator server's address and port.\r\n   Append an additional listener class in the configuration for SparkConnectService callback with the actual address and port on Yarn to the coordinator server.\r\n3) Wait for the coordinator server to receive the address callback from the SparkConnectService on Yarn and export the real address.\r\n4) Start the client (pyspark --remote $callback_address) with the remote address.\r\n\r\nFinally, a remote SparkConnect Server is started on Yarn with a local SparkConnect client connected. Users no longer need to start the server beforehand and connect to the remote server after they manually explore the address on Yarn.\r\n\r\n#Problem statement of this change:\r\n1) The specified port for the SparkConnectService GRPC server might be occupied on the node of the Hadoop Cluster.\r\n   To increase the success rate of startup, it needs to retry on conflicts rather than fail directly.\r\n2) Because the final binding port could be uncertain based on 1) when retry and the remote address is also unpredictable on Yarn, we need to retrieve the address and port programmatically and inject it automatically on the start of 'pyspark --remote'. To get the address of SparkConnectService on Yarn programmatically, the SparkConnectService needs to communicate its location back to the launcher side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n1. Add configuration `spark.connect.grpc.port.maxRetries` to enable port retries until an available port is found before reaching the maximum number of retries.\r\n\r\n3. The start and stop events of the SparkConnectService are observable through the SparkListener.\r\n   Two new events have been introduced:\r\n   - SparkListenerConnectServiceStarted: the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded hand-crafted implementations of unicode-aware lower-case `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith` to optimize UTF8_BINARY_LCASE for ASCII-only strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`UTF8String.toLowerCase()`, which is used for the aforementioned collation-aware functions, has an optimization for full-ascii strings, but still always allocates a new object. In this PR I introduced loop-based implementations, which fall-back to `toLowerCase()` in case they meet a non-asci character.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, these functions should behave exactly as:\r\n- `lhs.containsInLowerCase(rhs)` == `lhs.toLowerCase().contains(rhs.toLowerCase())`\r\n- `lhs.startsWithInLowerCase(rhs)` == `lhs.toLowerCase().startsWith(rhs.toLowerCase())`\r\n- `lhs.endsWithInLowerCase(rhs)` == `lhs.toLowerCase().endsWith(rhs.toLowerCase())`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test cases to `org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.CollationSupportSuite` and `org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8StringSuite`, including several unicode lowercase specific. Also I've run `CollationBenchmark` on GHA for JDK 17 and JDK 21 and have updated the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLanguages and localization for collations are supported by ICU library. Collation naming format is as follows:\r\n```\r\n<2-letter language code>[_<4-letter script>][_<3-letter country code>][_specifier_specifier...]\r\n```\r\nLocale specifier consists of the first part of collation name (language + script + country). Locale specifiers need to be stable across ICU versions; to keep existing ids and names invariant we introduce golden file will locale table which should case CI failure on any silent changes.\r\n\r\nCurrently supported optional specifiers:\r\n\r\n- `CS`/`CI` - case sensitivity, default is case-sensitive; supported by configuring ICU collation levels\r\n- `AS`/`AI` - accent sensitivity, default is accent-sensitive; supported by configuring ICU collation levels\r\n\r\nUser can use collation specifiers in any order except of locale which is mandatory and must go first. There is a one-to-one mapping between collation ids and collation names defined in `CollationFactory`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo add languages and localization support for collations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it adds new predefined collations.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded checks to `CollationFactorySuite` and ICU locale map golden file.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to bump Pandas version up to 2.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFrom Apache Spark 4.0.0, Pandas API on Spark supports Pandas 2.0.0 and above and some of features will be broken from Pandas 1.x, so installing Pandas 2.x is required.\r\n\r\nSee the full list of breaking changes from [Upgrading from PySpark 3.5 to 4.0](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/docs/source/migration_guide/pyspark_upgrade.rst#upgrading-from-pyspark-35-to-40).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the minimum Pandas version from user-facing documentation will be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-23T06:44:49Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T04:28:29Z","closed_at":"2024-04-23T14:49:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f768930b8cbebc84587b04d1b14a2c5572310328","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb4379be02d2cb6508599394da076d77b366b61a","head":{"label":"itholic:bump_pandas_2","ref":"bump_pandas_2","sha":"cb4379be02d2cb6508599394da076d77b366b61a","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46126 to branch-3.5.\r\n\r\nWhen `enableStableIdentifiersForUnionType` is enabled, all of the types are lowercased which creates a problem when field types are case-sensitive: \r\n\r\nUnion type with fields:\r\n```\r\nSchema.createEnum(\"myENUM\", \"\", null, List[String](\"E1\", \"e2\").asJava),\r\nSchema.createRecord(\"myRecord2\", \"\", null, false, List[Schema.Field](new Schema.Field(\"F\", Schema.create(Type.FLOAT))).asJava)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould become\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct<member_myenum: string, member_myrecord2: struct<f: float>> \r\n```\r\n\r\nbut instead should be \r\n```\r\nstruct<member_myENUM: string, member_myRecord2: struct<F: float>> \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug of lowercasing the field name (the type portion).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, if a user enables `enableStableIdentifiersForUnionType` and has Union types, all fields will preserve the case. Previously, the field names would be all in lowercase.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a test case to verify the new field names.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update K8s docs to recommend K8s v1.27+ for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\nThis is a kind of follow-up of the following previous PR because Apache Spark 4.0.0 schedule is delayed slightly.\r\n- #43069\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n**1. K8s community starts to release v1.30.0 from 2024-04-17.**\r\n- https://kubernetes.io/releases/#release-v1-30\r\n\r\n**2. Default K8s Version in Public Cloud environments**\r\n\r\nThe default K8s versions of public cloud providers are already K8s 1.27+.\r\n\r\n- EKS: v1.29 (Default)\r\n- GKE: v1.29 (Rapid),  v1.28 (Regular), v1.27 (Stable)\r\n- AKS: v1.27\r\n\r\n**3. End Of Support**\r\n\r\nIn addition, K8s 1.26 is going to reach EOL when Apache Spark 4.0.0 arrives because K8s 1.26 is also going to reach EOL on June.\r\n\r\n| K8s  |   AKS   |   GKE   |   EKS   |\r\n| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| 1.26 | 2024-03 | 2024-06 | 2024-06 |\r\n\r\n- [AKS EOL Schedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar)\r\n- [GKE EOL Schedule](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-schedule)\r\n- [EKS EOL Schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#kubernetes-release-calendar)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- No, this is a documentation-only change about K8s versions.\r\n- Apache Spark K8s Integration Test is currently using K8s v1.30.0 on Minikube already.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If there are no parameters specified by the user, the broadcast operation of hadoopconf will not be performed to improve the performance of the driver.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a correctness issue by moving the batch that resolves udf decoders to after the `UpdateNullability` batch. This means we now derive a  decoder with the updated attributes which fixes a correctness issue.\r\n\r\nI think the issue has existed since https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28645 when udf support case class arguments was added. So therefore this issue should be present in all currently supported versions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the following code\r\n```\r\nscala> val ds1 = Seq(1).toDS()\r\n     | val ds2 = Seq[Int]().toDS()\r\n     | val f = udf[Tuple1[Option[Int]],Tuple1[Option[Int]]](identity)\r\n     | ds1.join(ds2, ds1(\"value\") === ds2(\"value\"), \"left_outer\").select(f(struct(ds2(\"value\")))).collect()\r\nval ds1: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Int] = [value: int]\r\nval ds2: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Int] = [value: int]\r\nval f: org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedFunction = SparkUserDefinedFunction($Lambda$2481/0x00007f7f50961f08@6b1a2c9f,StructType(StructField(_1,IntegerType,true)),List(Some(class[_1[0]: int])),Some(class[_1[0]: int]),None,true,true)\r\nval res0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([[0]])\r\n```\r\nresults in an row containing `0` this is incorrect as the value should be `null`. Removing the udf call\r\n```\r\nscala> ds1.join(ds2, ds1(\"value\") === ds2(\"value\"), \"left_outer\").select(struct(ds2(\"value\"))).collect()\r\nval res1: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([[null]])\r\n```\r\ngives the correct value.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fixes a correctness issue when using ScalaUDFs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting and new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
