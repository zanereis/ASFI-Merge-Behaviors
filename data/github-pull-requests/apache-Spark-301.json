What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe code changes in PR(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16542) make me very confusing:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5a02e3a2ac8a25d92d98d3b3b0d1173dddb9cc91/streaming/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/scheduler/JobScheduler.scala#L203\r\n\r\n`\r\nprivate def handleJobCompletion(job: Job, completedTime: Long) {\r\n    val jobSet = jobSets.get(job.time)\r\n    jobSet.handleJobCompletion(job)\r\n    job.setEndTime(completedTime)\r\n    listenerBus.post(StreamingListenerOutputOperationCompleted(job.toOutputOperationInfo))\r\n    logInfo(\"Finished job \" + job.id + \" from job set of time \" + jobSet.time)\r\n    if (jobSet.hasCompleted) {\r\n      listenerBus.post(StreamingListenerBatchCompleted(jobSet.toBatchInfo))\r\n    }\r\n    job.result match {\r\n      case Failure(e) =>\r\n        reportError(\"Error running job \" + job, e)\r\n      case _ =>\r\n        if (jobSet.hasCompleted) {\r\n          jobSets.remove(jobSet.time)\r\n          jobGenerator.onBatchCompletion(jobSet.time)\r\n          logInfo(\"Total delay: %.3f s for time %s (execution: %.3f s)\".format(\r\n            jobSet.totalDelay / 1000.0, jobSet.time.toString,\r\n            jobSet.processingDelay / 1000.0\r\n          ))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`\r\n\r\nIf a Job failed and the JobSet containing it has completed, listenerBus will post a StreamingListenerBatchCompleted, while jobGenerator will not invoke onBatchCompletion. So the batch is completed or not ?\r\n\r\nThe key point is if a Job in a Batch failed, whether or not we consider the Batch as completed.\r\n\r\nI think if someone register a listener on StreamingListenerBatchCompleted, he just wants to get notified only when the batch finishes with no error. So if a Job is failed, we should not remove it from its JobSet, thus the JobSet has not completed. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to reduce AppVeyor test time. This PR proposes to reduce the number of shuffle partitions to reduce the tasks running R workers in few particular tests.\r\n\r\nThe symptom is similar as described in `https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19722`. There are many R processes newly launched on Windows without forking and it makes the differences of elapsed time between Linux and Windows.\r\n\r\nHere is the simple comparison for before/after of this change. I manually tested this by disabling `spark.sparkr.use.daemon`. Disabling it resembles the tests on Windows:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"672\" alt=\"2017-11-25 12 22 13\"

The main entry is `getExpressionInputParams` which returns all necessary parameters to evaluate the given expression in a split function.\r\n\r\nThis util methods can be used to split expressions too.

the following sceneï¼š\r\nWe set spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors to 3 and set spark.executor.cores to 1. There is only one stage with 3 tasks. The numExecutorsTarget will be 3.  For some reason, all of the 3 executors failed. Because of numExecutorsTarget has no change, ExecutorAllocationManager will not call ExecutorAllocationClient.requestTotalExecutors to request new executors.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we check the number of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is follow-on of #19518. This PR tries to reduce the number of constant pool entries used for accessing mutable state.\r\nThere are two directions:\r\n1. Primitive type variables should be allocated at the outer class due to better performance. Otherwise, this PR allocates an array.\r\n2. The length of allocated array is up to 32768 due to avoiding usage of constant pool entry at access (e.g. `mutableStateArray[32767]`).\r\n\r\nHere are some discussions to determine these directions.\r\n1. [[1]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19518#issuecomment-346690464), [[2]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19518#issuecomment-346690642), [[3]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19518#issuecomment-346828180), [[4]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19518#issuecomment-346831544), [[5]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19518#issuecomment-346857340)\r\n2. [[6]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19518#issuecomment-346729172), [[7]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19518#issuecomment-346798358), [[8]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19518#issuecomment-346870408)\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `addMutableState` function in the `CodeGenerator` to check if the declared state can be easily initialized compacted into an array. We identify three types of states that cannot compacted:\r\n\r\n- Primitive type state (ints, booleans, etc) if the number of them does not exceed threshold\r\n- Multiple-dimensional array type\r\n- `inline = true`\r\n\r\nWhen `useFreshName = false`, the given name is used.\r\n\r\nMany codes were ported from #19518. Many efforts were put here. I think this PR should credit to @bdrillard\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the following code is generated:\r\n```\r\n/* 005 */ class SpecificMutableProjection extends

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation of Spark, InMemoryTableExec read all data in a cached table, filter CachedBatch according to stats and pass data to the downstream operators. This implementation makes it inefficient to reside the whole table in memory to serve various queries against different partitions of the table, which occupies a certain portion of our users' scenarios.\r\n\r\ndesign doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSiP3ej7Wd2cWUPVrgqAtvxbSlu5_1ZZB6m_2t8_95Q/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of such a use case:\r\n\r\nstore_sales is a 1TB-sized table in cloud storage, which is partitioned by 'location'. The first query, Q1, wants to output several metrics A, B, C for all stores in all locations. After that, a small team of 3 data scientists wants to do some causal analysis for the sales in different locations. To avoid unnecessary I/O and parquet/orc parsing overhead, they want to cache the whole table in memory in Q1.\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation, even any one of the data scientists is only interested in one out of three locations, the queries they submit to Spark cluster is still reading 1TB data completely.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the extra reading operation is that we implement CachedBatch as\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase class CachedBatch(numRows: Int, buffers: Array[Array[Byte]], stats: InternalRow)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the stats is a part of every CachedBatch, so we can only filter batches for output of InMemoryTableExec operator by reading all data in in-memory table as input. The extra reading would be even more unacceptable when some of the table's data is evicted to disks.\r\n\r\nWe propose to introduce a new type of block, metadata block, for the partitions of RDD representing data in the cached table. Every metadata block contains stats info for all columns in a partition and is saved to BlockManager when executing compute() method for the partition. To minimize the number of bytes to read,\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. unit test: add 3 new unit tests\r\n\r\n2. performance test: \r\n\r\nEnvironment: 6 Executors, each of which has 16 cores 90G memory\r\n\r\ndataset: 1T TPCDS data\r\n\r\nqueries: tested 4 queries (Q19, Q46, Q34, Q27) in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a cherry pick of the original PR 19370 onto branch-2.2 as suggested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19370#issuecomment-346526920.\r\n\r\nFixing the way how `SPARK_HOME` is resolved on Windows. While the previous version was working with the built release download, the set of directories changed slightly for the PySpark `pip` or `conda` install. This has been reflected in Linux files in `bin` but not for Windows `cmd` files. \r\n\r\nFirst fix improves the way how the `jars` directory is found, as this was stoping Windows version of `pip/conda` install from working; JARs were not found by on Session/Context setup.\r\n\r\nSecond fix is adding `find-spark-home.cmd` script, which uses `find_spark_home.py` script, as the Linux version, to resolve `SPARK_HOME`. It is based on `find-spark-home` bash script, though, some operations are done in different order due to the `cmd` script language limitations. If environment variable is set, the Python script `find_spark_home.py` will not be run. The process can fail if Python is not installed, but it will mostly use this way if PySpark is installed via `pip/conda`, thus, there is some Python in the system. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested on local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds local checkpoint support to datasets and respective bind from Python Dataframe API.\r\n\r\nIf reliability requirements can be lowered to favor performance, as in cases of further quick transformations followed by a reliable save, localCheckpoints() fit very well. \r\nFurthermore, at the moment Reliable checkpoints still incur double computation (see #9428)\r\nIn general it makes the API more complete as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPython land quick use case:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from time

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ctx.currentVars` means the input variables for the current operator, which is already decided in `CodegenSupport`, we can set it there instead of `doConsume`.\r\n\r\nalso add more comments to help people understand the codegen framework.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, we now have a principle about setting `ctx.currentVars` and `ctx.INPUT_ROW`:\r\n1. for non-whole-stage-codegen path, never set them.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces # of global variables in generated code by replacing a global variable with a local variable with an allocation of an object every time. When a lot of global variables were generated, the generated code may meet 64K constant pool limit.  \r\nThis PR reduces # of generated global variables in the following three operations:\r\n* `Cast` with String to primitive byte/short/int/long\r\n* `RegExpReplace`\r\n* `CreateArray`\r\n\r\nI intentionally leave [this part](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/HashAggregateExec.scala#L595-L603). This is because this variable keeps a class that is dynamically generated. In other word, it is not possible to reuse one class.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixes a problem when one thread wants to add a new consumer into fully packed cache and another one still uses an instance of cached consumer which is marked for eviction. In such cases underlying KafkaConsumer throws ConcurrentModificationException.\r\n\r\nMy solution is to always remove the eldest consumer from the cache, but sometimes delay calling close() method (in separate thread) until is no longer used (released) by KafkaRDDIterator\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nSimple unit test: fails on the current master branch and doesn't after the patch\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-20T17:05:43Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T01:32:57Z","closed_at":"2018-06-10T11:49:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eab581fa7744846280ffbc5c9d66bb0ce4e3465c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/639f11c9fd856f58d067036f9b9131ea9efdc13d","head":{"label":"daroo:SPARK-22562","ref":"SPARK-22562","sha":"639f11c9fd856f58d067036f9b9131ea9efdc13d","user":{"login":"daroo","id":1213720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM3MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1213720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo","html_url":"https://github.com/daroo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111231529,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTEyMzE1Mjk=","name":"spark","full_name":"daroo/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"daroo","id":1213720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM3MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1213720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo","html_url":"https://github.com/daroo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daroo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/daroo/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn adaptive execution, one reducer may fetch multiple continuous shuffle blocks from one map output file. For example, originally the map thought it had 20,000 reducers and wrote the map output files accordingly, but the adaptive scheduling thought Spark really only need 2,000. In that case, each reducer really reads the output for 10 reducers the map originally created.\r\nCurrently, each reducer needs to fetch those 10 reducer blocks one by one, this way needs many IO and impacts performance. This PR is to support fetching those continuous shuffle blocks in one IO (batch way).\r\n\r\nThe shuffle block is stored like below:\r\n\r\nformat is s\"shuffle_$shuffleId_$mapId_$reduceId\", refering to BlockId.scala.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2989575/51654634-c37fbd80-1fd3-11e9-935e-5652863676c3.png\" height=\"200\" width=\"1000\">\r\n\r\nIn adaptive execution, one reducer may want to read output for reducer 5 to 14, whose block Ids are from shuffle_0_x_5 to shuffle_0_x_14.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, Spark needs 10 disk IOs + 10 network IOs for each output file.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, Spark only needs 1 disk IO and 1 network IO, this way can reduce IO dramatically.\r\n\r\n**High Level Design**\r\n\r\n1. The client writes the shuffle data, it knows the used serializer, compression codec etc., so it can decide if it is possible to read shuffle data in batch. See `BlockStoreShuffleReader.shouldFetchContinuousShuffleBlocksInBatch`.\r\n2. If the batch read is allowable, we need to merge those continuous ShuffleBlockId to reduce IO. The merge will be done both locally and remotely.\r\n- For local continuous shuffle blocks, the client can merge them by itself. See `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.fetchLocalBlocks`\r\n- For remote shuffle blocks:\r\n   - Normally, client packs ShuffleBlockIds into OpenBlocks message and send it to the remote server to fetch data, and then the remote server side returns a StreamHandle message as the response to OpenBlocks message.\r\n   - This PR extendsÂ OpenBlocks protocol to add an optionalÂ fetchContinuousShuffleBlocksInBatch boolean flag. The client uses this flag to asks server to merge shuffle blocks.\r\n   -  In server side:\r\n      If remote server supports merge, it will merge blocks and the returned StreamHandle.numChunks < OpenBlocks.blockIds.length. The client will check and know merge happens, so it will work accordingly.\r\n      If remote server does not support merges (like external shuffle service < 3.0), the returned StreamHandle.numChunks == OpenBlocks.blockId.length. The client will check and know merge does not happen , it will work accordingly also.\r\nSee `NettyBlockRpcServer.receive`, `ExternalShuffleBlockHandler.handleMessage` and `OneForOneBlockFetcher.start`.\r\n\r\n**Backward Compatibility**\r\n\r\nOne important thing is to be compatible with previous Spark version including both client and server.\r\nThis PR uses a similar way like PR#23510 to maintain backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis PR extendsÂ OpenBlocks to add an optionalÂ `fetchContinuousShuffleBlocksInBatch` boolean flag.\r\nIt will only be encoded to the message when it's true.Â OpenBlocks from old clients do not have this flag, which means this flag is false for them.\r\n\r\nThis is fully compatible:\r\n1. new client <-> new server: Definitely fine.\r\n2. old client <-> old server: Definitely fine.\r\n3. old client <-> new server: TheÂ OpenBlocks from the old client doesn't have theÂ fetchContinuousShuffleBlocksInBatch. The new server will see OpenBlocks.fetchContinuousShuffleBlocksInBatch = false, so it returns the shuffle blocks one by one. The old client works as before.\r\n4. new client <-> old server: TheÂ OpenBlocks from the new client contains theÂ fetchContinuousShuffleBlocksInBatch flag. But the old server doesn't know about it and stops reading the message right before theÂ fetchContinuousShuffleBlocksInBatch part. Then the old server still returns shuffle blocks one by one. New client checks StreamHandle.numChunks == OpenBlocks.blockId.lenght, it knows merge does not happen, so it can work accordingly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-20T07:42:03Z","updated_at":"2019-10-17T06:48:10Z","closed_at":"2019-10-17T06:48:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d246b6bb122f922e5c18706faddb0090252f951","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

This PR makes it sure all Spark tests uses `ThreadSignaler` explicitly which has the same default behavior of interrupting a thread on the JVM like ScalaTest 2.2.x. This will reduce potential flakiness.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is testsuite-only update.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHistogram is effective in dealing with skewed distribution. After we generate histogram information for column statistics, we need to adjust filter estimation based on histogram data structure.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe revised all the unit test cases by including histogram data structure.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s say I have a nested AND expression shown below and p2 can not be pushed down, \r\n\r\n(p1 AND p2) OR p3\r\n\r\nIn current Spark code, during data source filter translation, (p1 AND p2) is returned as p1 only and p2 is simply lost. This issue occurs with JDBC data source and is similar to [SPARK-12218](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10362) for Parquet. When we have AND nested below another expression, we should either push both legs or nothing. \r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n- The current Spark code will always split conjunctive predicate before it determines if a predicate can be pushed down or not\r\n- If I have (p1 AND p2) AND p3, it will be split into p1, p2, p3. There won't be nested AND expression.\r\n- The current Spark code logic for OR is OK. It either pushes both legs or nothing.\r\n\r\nThe same translation method is also called by Data Source V2. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test cases to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n_Originally this PR was submitted to the Spark on K8S fork [here](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark/pull/531) but has been advised to resend it upstream by @erikerlandson and @foxish. K8S specific items were removed from the PR and been reworked for the Apache version._\r\n\r\nPublishing Spark metrics into Prometheus - as highlighted in the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22343). Implemented a metrics sink that publishes Spark metrics into Prometheus via [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/pushing/). Metrics data published by Spark is based on [Dropwizard](http://metrics.dropwizard.io/). The format of Spark metrics is not supported natively by Prometheus thus these are converted using [DropwizardExports](https://prometheus.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/dropwizard/DropwizardExports.html) prior pushing metrics to the pushgateway.\r\n\r\nAlso the default Prometheus pushgateway client API implementation does not support metrics timestamp thus the client API has been ehanced to enrich metrics  data with timestamp. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR is not affecting the existing code base and not altering the functionality. Nevertheless, I have executed all `unit and integration` tests. Also this setup has been deployed and been monitored via Prometheus (Prometheus 1.7.1 + Pushgateway 0.3.1). \r\n\r\n`Manual` testing through deploying a Spark cluster, Prometheus server, Pushgateway and ran

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n** Updated pull request based on some other refactoring that went into FsHistoryProvider **\r\n\r\nThe spark history server doesn't clean up certain history files outside the retention window leading to thousands of such files lingering around on our servers. The log checking and clean up logic skipped 0 byte files and expired inprogress or complete history files that weren't properly parseable (not able to extract an app id or otherwise parse...) Note these files most likely appeared to due aborted jobs or earlier spark/file system driver bugs. To mitigate this, FsHistoryProvider.checkForLogs now internally identifies these untracked files and will remove them if they expire outside the cleaner retention window.\r\n\r\nThis is currently controlled via configuration spark.history.fs.cleaner.aggressive=true to perform more aggressive cleaning.\r\n\r\nFixed logic:\r\n\r\ncheckForLogs excluded 0-size files so they stuck around forever.\r\ncheckForLogs / mergeApplicationListing indefinitely ignored files\r\nthat were not parseable/couldn't extract an appID, so they stuck around\r\nforever.\r\nOnly apply above logic if spark.history.fs.cleaner.aggressive=true.\r\n\r\nFixed race condition in a test (SPARK-3697: ignore files that cannot be\r\nread.) where the number of mergeApplicationListings could be more than 1\r\nsince the FsHistoryProvider would spin up an executor that also calls\r\ncheckForLogs in parallel with the test.\r\n\r\nAdded unit test to cover all cases with aggressive and non-aggressive\r\nclean up logic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nImplemented a unit test that exercises the above cases without and without the aggressive cleaning to ensure correct results in all cases. Note that FsHistoryProvider at one place uses the file system to get the current time and and at other times the local system time, this seems inconsistent/buggy but I did not attempt to fix in this commit. I was forced to change one of the method FsHistoryProvider.getNewLastScanTime() for the test to properly mock the clock.\r\n\r\nAlso ran a history server and touched some files to verify they were properly removed.\r\n\r\nericvandenberg@localhost /tmp/spark-events % ls -la\r\ntotal 808K\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 ericvandenberg 272 Jul 31 18:22 .\r\ndrwxrwxrwt 127 root\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ericvandenberg 0 Jan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInt96 data written by impala vs data written by hive & spark is stored slightly differently -- they use a different offset for the timezone.  This adds an option \"spark.sql.parquet.int96TimestampConversion\" (false by default) to adjust timestamps if and only if the writer is impala (or more precisely, if the parquet file's \"createdBy\" metadata does not start with \"parquet-mr\").  This matches the existing behavior in hive from HIVE-9482. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test added, existing tests run via jenkins.","created_at":"2017-11-16T21:11:23Z","updated_at":"2017-12-09T02:55:59Z","closed_at":"2017-12-09T02:55:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6f5e0093db8a344f3b05b41af24cf53c3db2490","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ea75c0a8f2c5fed33b2a6d6102ad1d8bdf73906","head":{"label":"squito:SPARK-12297_skip_conversion","ref":"SPARK-12297_skip_conversion","sha":"1ea75c0a8f2c5fed33b2a6d6102ad1d8bdf73906","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA frequently reported issue of Spark is the Java 64kb compile error. This is because Spark generates a very big method and it's usually caused by 3 reasons:\r\n\r\n1. a deep expression tree, e.g. a very complex filter condition\r\n2. many individual expressions, e.g. expressions can have many children, operators can have many expressions.\r\n3. a deep query plan tree (with whole stage codegen)\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses on 1. There are already several patches(#15620  #18972 #18641) trying to fix this issue and some of them are already merged. However this is an endless job as every non-leaf expression has this issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix this issue in `Expression.genCode`, to make sure the code for a single expression won't grow too big.\r\n\r\nAccording to @maropu 's benchmark, no regression is found with TPCDS (thanks @maropu !):

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn adaptive execution, the map output statistics of all mappers will be aggregated after previous stage is successfully executed. Driver takes the aggregation job while it will get slow when the number of `mapper * shuffle partitions` is large, since it only uses single thread to compute. This PR uses multi-thread to deal with this single point bottleneck.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest cases are in `MapOutputTrackerSuite.scala`\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-16T04:21:40Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T14:12:13Z","closed_at":"2017-11-24T14:12:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c158e09dba2fcb81a18dbdb3663fab88f74eafe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f87dd6989ed092a3f06b1a308930265a6bc0a30","head":{"label":"gcz2022:single_point_mapstatistics","ref":"single_point_mapstatistics","sha":"0f87dd6989ed092a3f06b1a308930265a6bc0a30","user":{"login":"gcz2022","id":7685352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODUzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7685352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022","html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75595311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTU5NTMxMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gcz2022/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gcz2022","id":7685352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODUzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7685352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022","html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter manually disabling `reuseSubquery` rule, the subqueries won't be reused. But on the SQL graph, there is only one subquery node and it looks like subquery is reused.\r\n\r\n`SparkPlanGraph` compares different `SparkPlanInfo`s by comparing their `simpleString`, which requires us to design `simpleString` well. While `SubqueryExec`'s `simpleString` depends only on the `exprId`, so we need to add extra index to its name.\r\n\r\nI test on TPC-DS q23b.\r\n\r\nBefore my PR, the UI graph when manually disable `reuseSubquery`:\r\n![subquery_seems_reused](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7685352/32837412-72fd36d0-ca48-11e7-8e91-c1d44e4d1ebf.png)\r\n\r\nWith my PR, the UI graph when manually disable `reuseSubquery`:\r\n![subquery_not_used](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7685352/32837451-9618f4ec-ca48-11e7-9ddd-810953d65904.png)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUI change.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCode generation is disabled for CaseWhen when the number of branches is higher than `spark.sql.codegen.maxCaseBranches` (which defaults to 20). This was done to prevent the well known 64KB method limit exception.\r\nThis PR proposes to support code generation also in those cases (without causing exceptions of course). As a side effect, we could get rid of the `spark.sql.codegen.maxCaseBranches` configuration.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

change restores the functionality that keeps a limited number of\r\ndifferent types (jobs, stages, etc) depending on configuration, to avoid\r\nthe store growing indefinitely over time.\r\n\r\nThe feature is implemented by creating a new type (ElementTrackingStore)\r\nthat wraps a KVStore and allows triggers to be set up for when elements\r\nof a certain type meet a certain threshold. Triggers don't need to\r\nnecessarily only delete elements, but the current API is set up in a way\r\nthat makes that use case easier.\r\n\r\nThe new store also has a trigger for the \"close\" call, which makes it\r\neasier for listeners to register code for cleaning things up and flushing\r\npartial state to the store.\r\n\r\nThe old configurations for cleaning up the stored elements from the core\r\nand SQL UIs are now active again, and the old unit tests are re-enabled.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-14T22:30:15Z","updated_at":"2017-12-19T00:50:52Z","closed_at":"2017-12-18T20:11:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d8845659b6087d530f7ef96ccdda3b044cb8978","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19751/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19751/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19751/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d384ff44380f940a611307881c6f5dca19e526e7","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20653","ref":"SPARK-20653","sha":"d384ff44380f940a611307881c6f5dca19e526e7","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

the new UI store, the API resource classes have a lot less code,\r\nsince there's no need for complicated translations between the UI\r\ntypes and the API types. So the code ended up with a bunch of files\r\nwith a single method declared in them.\r\n\r\nThis change re-structures the API code so that it uses less classes;\r\nmainly, most sub-resources were removed, and the code to deal with\r\nsingle-attempt and multi-attempt apps was simplified.\r\n\r\nThe only change was the addition of a method to return a single\r\nattempt's information; that was missing in the old API, so trying\r\nto retrieve \"/v1/applications/appId/attemptId\" would result in a\r\n404 even if the attempt existed (and URIs under that one would\r\nreturn valid data).\r\n\r\nThe streaming API resources also overtook the same treatment, even\r\nthough the data is not stored in the new UI store.","created_at":"2017-11-14T17:54:20Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T13:28:01Z","closed_at":"2017-11-15T21:44:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6dde1ff3f9477d8e32eee6c99ef522220dd12806","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fec91b6d9d7728f9fdfe96fbacf34d8f4d387a83","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20649","ref":"SPARK-20649","sha":"fec91b6d9d7728f9fdfe96fbacf34d8f4d387a83","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* JIRA:  [SPARK-22431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22431)  : Creating Permanent view with illegal type\r\n\r\n**Description:** \r\n- It is possible in Spark SQL to create a permanent view that uses an nested field with an illegal name.\r\n- For example if we create the following view:\r\n```create view x as select struct('a' as `$q`, 1 as b) q```\r\n- A simple select fails with the following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from x;\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Cannot recognize hive type string: struct<$q:string,b:int>\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$.fromHiveColumn(HiveClientImpl.scala:812)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$$anonfun$getTableOption$1$$anonfun$apply$11$$anonfun$7.apply(HiveClientImpl.scala:378)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$$anonfun$getTableOption$1$$anonfun$apply$11$$anonfun$7.apply(HiveClientImpl.scala:378)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n**Issue/Analysis**: Right now, we can create a view with a schema that cannot be read back by Spark from the Hive metastore.  For more details, please see the discussion about the analysis and proposed fix options in comment 1 and comment 2 in the [SPARK-22431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22431) \r\n\r\n**Proposed changes**: \r\n - Fix the hive table/view codepath to check whether the schema datatype is parseable by Spark before persisting it in the metastore. This change is localized to HiveClientImpl to do the check similar to the check in FromHiveColumn. This is fail-fast and we will avoid the scenario where we write something to the metastore that we are unable to read it back.  \r\n- Added new unit tests\r\n- Ran the sql related unit test suites ( hive/test, sql/test, catalyst/test) OK\r\n\r\nWith the fix: \r\n```\r\ncreate view x as select struct('a' as `$q`, 1 as b) q;\r\n17/11/28 10:44:55 ERROR SparkSQLDriver: Failed in [create view x as select struct('a' as `$q`, 1 as b) q]\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Cannot recognize hive type string: struct<$q:string,b:int>\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$.org$apache$spark$sql$hive$client$HiveClientImpl$$getSparkSQLDataType(HiveClientImpl.scala:884)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$$anonfun$org$apache$spark$sql$hive$client$HiveClientImpl$$verifyColumnDataType$1.apply(HiveClientImpl.scala:906)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$$anonfun$org$apache$spark$sql$hive$client$HiveClientImpl$$verifyColumnDataType$1.apply(HiveClientImpl.scala:906)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator$class.foreach(Iterator.scala:893)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- New unit tests have been added. \r\n\r\n@hvanhovell, Please review and share your thoughts/comments.  Thank you so much.","created_at":"2017-11-14T17:04:44Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T21:45:37Z","closed_at":"2017-11-28T21:03:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52572dfea3df13ae4f6fb5eb5889ec478efdbad5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19747/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19747/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19747/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d2458d478662e6d2d5fb31ce1c9ae48f8ccdaa33","head":{"label":"skambha:spark22431","ref":"spark22431","sha":"d2458d478662e6d2d5fb31ce1c9ae48f8ccdaa33","user":{"login":"skambha","id":16563220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTYzMjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16563220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha","html_url":"https://github.com/skambha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49237548,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTIzNzU0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"skambha/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skambha","id":16563220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTYzMjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16563220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha","html_url":"https://github.com/skambha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skambha/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA new VectorSizeHint transformer was added. This transformer is meant to be used as a pipeline stage ahead of VectorAssembler, on vector columns, so that VectorAssembler can join vectors in a streaming context where the size of the input vectors is otherwise not known.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs comment in [SPARK-2926](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2926), this is the follow up work for the old patch on Spark 2.x version. Also this is a preview PR and will add more UT after community think it still worth to follow up. Detailed benchmark attached in jira and this patch mainly to the work below:\r\n1. For support Spark Streaming, Class `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` added some wrapping work for ManageBuffer, so here I changes ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator to get the ManagerBuffer, and do the wrapping work out of ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator\r\n2. Class `ShuffleMmeoryManager` has been replaced by `TaskMemoryManager`, so I write a new class named ExternalMergerinherits from `Spillable[ArrayBuffer[MemoryShuffleBlock]]`, this class manage all files and in memory block during `SortShuffleReader.read()`\r\n3. Add a tag named `canUseSortShuffleWriter` in `SortShuffleManager`, for the bug fix of Spark UT error in the scenario of using `UnsafeShuffleWriter` in shuffle write stage but using `SortShuffleReader` in shuffle read stage.\r\n4. Add shuffle metrics of peakMemoryUsedBytes.\r\n5. A Bug fix of datainconsistency in old patch.

I will add more UT and complete this PR follow community's advise.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-14T14:22:24Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T15:46:14Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T15:46:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abb97d12cecd43041fe4c6ff0d60b7e04d06f9f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fe9394eadf8ea51af2b2cb41b5b42981fa600752","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:sort-shuffle-read-master","ref":"sort-shuffle-read-master","sha":"fe9394eadf8ea51af2b2cb41b5b42981fa600752","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, relation size is computed as the sum of file size, which is error-prone because storage format like parquet may have a much smaller file size compared to in-memory size. When we choose broadcast join based on file size, there's a risk of OOM. But if the number of rows is available in statistics, we can get a better estimation by `numRows * rowSize`, which helps to alleviate this problem.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case for data source table and hive table.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-14T09:15:03Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T19:46:32Z","closed_at":"2017-11-28T19:46:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a6aa4e732baebc6a993ddc42796de06db6935de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/acc498ca072d5cf1cbe8a282df5efdae5a1a7d0c","head":{"label":"wzhfy:better_leaf_size","ref":"better_leaf_size","sha":"acc498ca072d5cf1cbe8a282df5efdae5a1a7d0c","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

periodically till it gets shutdown as part DriverEndpoint.onStop(). There is no proper coordination between the driver-revive-thread(shutdown) and the RpcEndpoint unregister, RpcEndpoint unregister happens first and then driver-revive-thread shuts down as part of DriverEndpoint.onStop(), In-between driver-revive-thread may try to send the ReviveOffers message which is leading to the above exception.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, this PR moves the shutting down of driver-revive-thread to CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.stop() which executes before the DriverEndpoint unregister.\r\n\r\n**Instance 2:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n17/11/10 16:31:38 ERROR cluster.YarnSchedulerBackend$YarnSchedulerEndpoint: Error requesting driver to remove executor 1 for reason Executor for container container_1508535467865_0226_01_000002 exited because of a YARN event (e.g., pre-emption) and not because of an error in the running job.\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Could not find CoarseGrainedScheduler.\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.netty.Dispatcher.postMessage(Dispatcher.scala:160)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.netty.Dispatcher.postLocalMessage(Dispatcher.scala:135)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.netty.NettyRpcEnv.ask(NettyRpcEnv.scala:229)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.netty.NettyRpcEndpointRef.ask(NettyRpcEnv.scala:516)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.RpcEndpointRef.ask(RpcEndpointRef.scala:63)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.scheduler.cluster.YarnSchedulerBackend$YarnSchedulerEndpoint$$anonfun$receive$1.applyOrElse(YarnSchedulerBackend.scala:269)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.netty.Inbox$$anonfun$process$1.apply$mcV$sp(Inbox.scala:117)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.netty.Inbox.safelyCall(Inbox.scala:205)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.netty.Inbox.process(Inbox.scala:101)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rpc.netty.Dispatcher$MessageLoop.run(Dispatcher.scala:221)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere YarnDriverEndpoint tries to send remove executor messages after the Yarn scheduler backend service stop, which is leading to the above exception. To avoid the above exception, \r\n1) We may add a condition(which checks whether service has stopped or not) before sending executor remove message\r\n2) Add a warn log message in onFailure case when the service is already stopped\r\n\r\nIn this PR, chosen the 2) option which adds a log message in the case of onFailure without the exception stack trace since the option 1) would need to to go through for every remove executor message.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI verified it manually, I don't see these exceptions with the PR changes.","created_at":"2017-11-14T02:47:14Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T18:42:10Z","closed_at":"2017-12-06T18:42:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d57d93664b1ebb325d3ec02bede6f5a9d72b1261","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19741/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19741/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19741/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5419cddae095a45ec91b836e781b783d49b60e82","head":{"label":"devaraj-kavali:SPARK-14228","ref":"SPARK-14228","sha":"5419cddae095a45ec91b836e781b783d49b60e82","user":{"login":"devaraj-kavali","id":3174804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3174804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali","html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20208591,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDIwODU5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"devaraj-kavali/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"devaraj-kavali","id":3174804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3174804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali","html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLogically the `Array` doesn't belong to `ColumnVector`, and `Row` doesn't belong to `ColumnarBatch`. e.g. `ColumnVector` needs to return `Array` for `getArray`, and `Row` for `getStruct`. `Array` and `Row` can return each other with the `getArray`/`getStruct` methods.\r\n\r\nThis is also a step to make `ColumnVector` public, it's cleaner to have `Array` and `Row` as top-level classes.\r\n\r\nThis PR is just code moving around, with 2 renaming: `ColumnVector.Array` -> `ColumnarArray`, `ColumnarBatch.Row` -> `ColumnarRow`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests.","created_at":"2017-11-14T01:04:18Z","updated_at":"2017-11-16T00:51:26Z","closed_at":"2017-11-15T13:45:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5971b9580c0ada0bf8fb19c130d0613c2217cc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19740/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19740/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19740/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b150abfe6d56a425b34e1d37b5c9240ac465936f","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:vector","ref":"vector","sha":"b150abfe6d56a425b34e1d37b5c9240ac465936f","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror
