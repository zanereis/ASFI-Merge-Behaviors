for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nParquet has supported vector read speed up with this PR [Vectorized BytePacker decoder using Java Vector API](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/pull/1011)\r\nThe performance gain is 4x ~ 8x according to the parquet microbenchmark\r\nTPC-H(SF100) Q6 has 11% performance increase with Apache Spark integrating parquet vector optimization\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR used to support parquet vector optimization\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd configuration  spark.sql.parquet.vector512.read.enabled, If true and CPU contains avx512vbmi & avx512_vbmi2 instruction set, parquet decodes using Java Vector API. For Intel CPU, Ice Lake or newer contains the required instruction set.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFor the test case, there are some problems to fix:\r\n1. It is necessary to Parquet-mr community release new java version to use the parquet vector optimization. \r\n2. Parquet Vector optimization does not release default, so users have to build parquet with **mvn clean install -P vector-plugins** manually to get the parquet-encoding-vector-{VERSION}.jar and put it on the {SPARK_HOME}/jars path\r\n3. github doesn't support select runners with specific instruction set. So it is impossible (a self-hosted runner can do it) to verify the optimization on github runners machine.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a new configuration `spark.kubernetes.setSubmitTimeInDriver`.\r\nWhen an application is deployed using spark-submit in k8s cluster mode, let `spark.app.submitTime` be the time spark-submit executed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, when an application is deployed using spark-submit in k8s cluster mode, `spark.app.submitTime` is the time driver pod started.\r\nDriver pod pending time is not included in the time between `spark.app.submitTime` and `spark.app.startTime`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd test:\r\n* \"SPARK-43014: Set `spark.app.submitTime` if missing\" \r\n* \"SPARK-43014: Overwrite

needed?\r\nSparkPlan's vectorType's attribute can be used to specialize codegen however BatchScanExecBase does not override this so we DSv2 sources do not get any benefit of concrete class

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* Added a new config property — `spark.yarn.report.loggingFrequency`\r\n* Limit the number of times the yarn application report is logged based on the number of reports processed.\r\n   \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, an application report is generated every second, this tends to add a lot of noise especially for long running applications. This bloats the log file and makes it hard to navigate. With this change, we can limit the amount of times the application status report is logged based on the number of reports processed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe logs are now ~30s apart\r\n```\r\n31-03-2023 15:00:08 PDT countByCountryFlow_countByCountry INFO - 23/03/31 22:00:08 INFO yarn.Client: Application report for application_1676870052658_5870144 (state: RUNNING)\r\n31-03-2023 15:00:38 PDT countByCountryFlow_countByCountry INFO - 23/03/31 22:00:38 INFO yarn.Client: Application report for application_1676870052658_5870144 (state: RUNNING)\r\n31-03-2023 15:01:08 PDT countByCountryFlow_countByCountry INFO - 23/03/31 22:01:08 INFO yarn.Client: Application report for application_1676870052658_5870144 (state: RUNNING)\r\n31-03-2023 15:01:38 PDT countByCountryFlow_countByCountry INFO - 23/03/31 22:01:38 INFO yarn.Client: Application report for application_1676870052658_5870144 (state: RUNNING)\r\n31-03-2023 15:02:09 PDT countByCountryFlow_countByCountry INFO - 23/03/31 22:02:09 INFO yarn.Client: Application report for application_1676870052658_5870144 (state: RUNNING)\r\n31-03-2023 15:02:31 PDT countByCountryFlow_countByCountry INFO - 23/03/31 22:02:31 INFO yarn.Client: Application report for application_1676870052658_5870144 (state: FINISHED)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested locally to ensure the behavior was as expected\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSparkPlan's vectorType's attribute can be used to specialize codegen however BatchScanExecBase does not override this so we DSv2 sources do not get any benefit of concrete

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2004`  error to an internal error. Also this PR improves the error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2004` cannot be triggered from user code (for instance, some SQL query), more detail:\r\n\r\n1. `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2004` error is thrown in `Literal.default` for `CharType`, `VarcharType` and other user-implemented DataType.\r\n2. `Literal.default` is called in these cases below:\r\n    1. in `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.Average`, for getting initial value; but in this case, DataType would only be  DecimalType / YearMonthIntervalType / DayTimeIntervalType / DoubleType; these types are supported by `Literal.default`.\r\n    2. in `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.Sum`, is same as `Average`\r\n    3. in `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.planning.ExtractEquiJoinKeys` and `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.AsOfJoin`; In real scene, they are use for DateFrame api, but `CharType` and `VarcharType` cannot be as a part of DataFrame's schema( they would be converted to StringType); and user-defined DataType do not have a matched Encoder in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to provide a 'ValidationMode' in org.apache.spark.sql.execution.ExplainMode that will only print the parsed and analysed logical plans only.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nValidate the sql query before submitting the job . We are currently using df.explain(extended=true) which generates parsed , analysed , optimised logical plan and physical plan . But generating optimised logical plan sometimes takes more time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce *any* user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current TorrentBroadcast implementation is originally designed for large data transmission where driver might become the bottleneck and memory might also be the concern. Therefore it's kind of heavy and comes with some fixed overhead:\r\n\r\n- torrent protocol: more round traffic\r\n- disk level persistency, BlockManager, extra overhead\r\n\r\nwhich makes it inefficient for some small data transmission.\r\n\r\nWe can have a lightweight broadcast implementation, e.g, SmallBroadcast, which implement star-topology broadcast(which avoids the unnecessary round traffic), and maybe in-memory only.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThe current factory style API seem to encourage only one broadcast style on runtime, however this small broadcast implementation is a supplement to `TorrentBroadcast`. So I introduce new small broadcast APIs along the code path.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvide a lightweight implementation of `Broadcast`, which is suitable for situation where data size is small and latency is critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test. More testcases are from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to provide a 'ValidationMode' in org.apache.spark.sql.execution.ExplainMode that will only print the parsed and analysed logical plans only.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nValidate the sql query before submitting the job . We are currently using df.explain(extended=true) which generates parsed , analysed , optimised logical plan and physical plan . But generating  optimised logical plan  sometimes takes more time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate remaining `TypeError` from `python/pyspark/sql/connect/dataframe.py` into `PySparkTypeError`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo migrate all user-facing errors into PySpark error framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's internal error framework improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-31T10:39:26Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:47:13Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T10:33:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e55a521a00b276cb611c9f4211b958969a29d581","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b0279987bf06ba2b7b945d0e6845fdb2d04d3606","head":{"label":"itholic:connect_df_error","ref":"connect_df_error","sha":"b0279987bf06ba2b7b945d0e6845fdb2d04d3606","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change API of parameterized SQL, and replace type of argument values from `string` to `Any` in Scala/Java/Python and `Expression.Literal` in protobuf API. Language API can accept `Any` objects from which it is possible to construct literal expressions.\r\n\r\n#### Scala/Java:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  def sql(sqlText: String, args: Map[String, Any]): DataFrame\r\n```\r\nvalues of the `args` map are wrapped by the `lit()` function which leaves `Column` as is and creates a literal from other Java/Scala objects (for more details see the `Scala` tab at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html).\r\n\r\n#### Python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sql(self, sqlQuery: str, args: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, **kwargs: Any) -> DataFrame:\r\n```\r\nSimilarly to Scala/Java `sql`, Python's `sql()` accepts Python objects as values of the `args` dictionary (see more details about acceptable Python objects at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html). `sql()` converts dictionary values to `Column` literal expressions by `lit()`.\r\n\r\n#### Protobuf:\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nmessage SqlCommand {\r\n  // (Required) SQL Query.\r\n  string sql = 1;\r\n\r\n  // (Optional) A map of parameter names to literal expressions.\r\n  map<string, Expression.Literal> args = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val sqlText = \"\"\"SELECT s FROM VALUES ('Jeff /*__*/ Green'), ('E\\'Twaun Moore') AS t(s) WHERE s = :player_name\"\"\"\r\nsqlText: String = SELECT s FROM VALUES ('Jeff /*__*/ Green'), ('E\\'Twaun Moore') AS t(s) WHERE s = :player_name\r\n\r\nscala> sql(sqlText, args = Map(\"player_name\" -> lit(\"E'Twaun Moore\"))).show(false)\r\n+-------------+\r\n|s            |\r\n+-------------+\r\n|E'Twaun Moore|\r\n+-------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current implementation the parameterized `sql()` requires arguments as string values parsed to SQL literal expressions that causes the following issues:\r\n1. SQL comments are skipped while parsing, so, some fragments of input might be skipped. For example, `'Europe -- Amsterdam'`. In this case, `-- Amsterdam` is excluded from the input.\r\n2. Special chars in string values must be escaped, for instance `'E\\'Twaun Moore'`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since the parameterized SQL feature https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38864 hasn't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParametersSuite\"\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.sql.tests.connect.test_connect_basic SparkConnectBasicTests.test_sql_with_args'\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.sql.session SparkSession.sql'\r\n```","created_at":"2023-03-31T10:00:13Z","updated_at":"2023-04-04T17:50:49Z","closed_at":"2023-04-04T15:22:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0588818ecce2bfb8f83a33f45392e69febdefdde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40623/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40623/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40623/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/67f34e9182fbe6600346c4ec333211f951867605","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:parameterized-sql-any","ref":"parameterized-sql-any","sha":"67f34e9182fbe6600346c4ec333211f951867605","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Moved `ResolveBinaryArithmetic` from `Analyzer` to `TypeCoercion` and `AnsiTypeCoercion`.\r\n2. Update `ResolveBinaryArithmetic` in `AnsiTypeCoercion` to only support datetime and interval types +/- intervals.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor string type  +/- internal, the string value can be date, timestamp and interval. We don't know what type of string should be casted to. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select \"2023-01-08\" - interval '7' day;\r\n2023-01-01 00:00:00\r\nspark-sql (default)> select \"INTERVAL '7' DAY\" - interval '7' day; -- \"INTERVAL '7' DAY\" should be cased to interval type.\r\nNULL\r\nspark-sql (default)> select interval '7' day - interval '6' day;\r\n1 00:00:00.000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nDisable string +/- interval in ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdate existing test.","created_at":"2023-03-31T07:00:24Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T00:22:38Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T00:22:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3964b70167193bcc0d5a7a27ecf451ad669f129","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1b7df1b033d3f602084ed1df59f0fb53dc6f0d8e","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-42991","ref":"SPARK-42991","sha":"1b7df1b033d3f602084ed1df59f0fb53dc6f0d8e","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467759455,"node_id":"R_kgDOG-FxXw","name":"spark","full_name":"wangyum/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new dependency on the datasketches-java project, and provides 4 new functions which utilize Datasketches HllSketch and Union instances for unique counting and intermediate storage of HLL sketches. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing approx_count_distinct provides unique counting functionality, but does not provide the ability to store HLL sketches for re-aggregation. After discussions with the Databricks team, we decided that integrating the Datasketches HllSketch implementation would make more sense than extending the existing approx_count_distinct functionality, given the wide use of the Datasketches library. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39678 and https://github.com/RyanBerti/spark/pull/1 for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR introduces two new aggregate functions:\r\n- hll_sketch_agg\r\n- hll_union_agg\r\n\r\nAnd two new scalar functions:\r\n- hll_sketch_estimate\r\n- hll_union\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI've included various tests in the DataframeAggregateSuite and new DatasketchesHllSketchSuite test suite.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-31T01:38:11Z","updated_at":"2023-05-10T21:38:08Z","closed_at":"2023-05-02T10:59:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d61d8bb6d610940b932925d31dea4c7309bc42b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d609f4df679caff1d2a7ad69cdca7f6ead390617","head":{"label":"RyanBerti:SPARK-16484_add_datasketches_hllsketch","ref":"SPARK-16484_add_datasketches_hllsketch","sha":"d609f4df679caff1d2a7ad69cdca7f6ead390617","user":{"login":"RyanBerti","id":17288675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjg4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17288675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":583148820,"node_id":"R_kgDOIsIlFA","name":"spark","full_name":"RyanBerti/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RyanBerti","id":17288675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjg4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17288675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a destructive iterator to SparkResult and change `Dataset.toLocalIterator` to use the desctructive iterator.\r\nWith the desctructive iterator, we will:\r\n1. Close the `ColumarBatch` once its data got consumed;\r\n2. Remove the `ColumarBatch` from `SparkResult.batches`;\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nInstead of keeping everything in memory for the life time of SparkResult object, clean it up as soon as we know we are done with it. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSQLMetrics is not only used in the UI, but is also a programming API as users can write a listener, get the physical plan, and read the SQLMetrics values directly.\r\n\r\nWe can ask users to update their code and read SQLMetrics from the new `WriteFiles` node instead. But this is troublesome and sometimes they may need to get both write metrics and commit metrics, then they need to look at two physical plan nodes. Given that https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39428 is mostly for cleanup and does not have many benefits, reverting is a better idea.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, they can programmatically get the write command metrics as before. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd option to skip commit coordinator as part of StreamingWrite API for DSv2 sources/sinks. This option was already present as part of the BatchWrite API\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSinks such as the following are atleast-once for which we do not need to go through the commit coordinator on the driver to ensure that a single partition commits. This is even less useful for streaming use-cases where batches could be replayed from the checkpoint dir.\r\n\r\n- memory sink\r\n- console sink\r\n- no-op sink\r\n- Kafka v2 sink\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test for the change\r\n```\r\n[info] ReportSinkMetricsSuite:\r\n22:23:01.276 WARN

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR fixes a bug that SparkListenerTaskStart can have `stageAttemptId = -1` when a task is launched after the stage is cancelled. Actually, we should use the information within `Task` to update the `stageAttemptId` field.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n-1 is not a legal stageAttemptId value, thus it can lead to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40234, which makes it possible for extensions to create custom `Dataset`s and `Column`s. It exposes `Dataset.plan`, but unfortunately it does not expose `Column.expr`. This means that extensions cannot build custom `Column`s that provide a user provider `Column` as input.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds core streaming API support for Spark Connect. With this, we can run majority of streaming queries. All the sources and syncs are supported. Most of the aggregations are supported. \r\nExamples of features that are not yet supported: APIs that run user codes like streaming listener, `foreachBatch()` API etc. \r\n\r\nThe remaining missing APIs will be added soon. \r\n\r\nHow to try it in local mode (`./bin/pyspark --remote \"local[*]\"`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> \r\n>>> query = ( \r\n...   spark\r\n...     .readStream\r\n...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixed the problem that LDAP authentication cannot be performed correctly when the domain parameter is passed in. For example, Spark Thrift Server will encounter this problem when using Active Directory and passing domain for LDAP authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the LDAP provider has domain configuration, such as Active Directory, the principal should not be constructed according to the DN pattern, but the user containing the domain should be directly passed to the LDAP provider as the principal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new rule `CoalesceCachePartitions` to support coalesce partitions with `TableCacheQueryStageExec`. In order to reuse the code path with `CoalesceShufflePartitions`, this pr also does a small refactor about how we coalesce partitions.\r\n\r\nRDD cache use the RDD id and partition id as the block id, so it seems not possible to split skewd partitions like shuffle. To reduce complexity, this pr does not allow coalesce partitions with both shuffle and cache stage since shuffle read may contain skewed partition spec.\r\n\r\nFor example, the follow case can not be coalesced by both `CoalesceCachePartitions` and `CoalesceShufflePartitions`.\r\n```\r\nSMJ\r\n  ShuffleQueryStage\r\n  TableCacheStage\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake AQE support coalesce table cache stage partitions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, add a new config to control if coalesce partitions for  table cache stage.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

`InSubqueryExec` with `shouldBroadcast=false`. The driver waits for the subquery to finish, but it's the executor that uses the results of the subquery (for predicate codegen or evaluation). Because `shouldBroadcast` is set to false, the result is stored in a transient field (`InSubqueryExec#result`), so the result of the subquery is not serialized when the `InSubqueryExec` instance is sent to the executor.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs, as far as I can tell, only when both whole stage codegen is disabled and adaptive execution is disabled. When wholestage codegen is enabled, the predicate codegen happens on the driver, so the subquery's result is available.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMost uses of `Random` in spark are either in testcases or where we need a pseudo random number which is repeatable.\r\nUse `SecureRandom`, instead of `Random` for the cases where it impacts security.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUse of `SecureRandom` in more security sensitive contexts.\r\nThis was flagged in our internal scans as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nDirectly no.\r\nWould improve security posture of Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

First introduce a new RDD, it consists of parent rdds that has the same partition size. The ith parttition corresponds to ith partition of each parent rdd.\r\n2. Then push the required distribution to union plan's children. If any child output partitioning matches the required distribution , we can reduce this child shuffle operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUnion plan does not take full advantage of children plan output partitionings when output partitoning can't match parent plan's required distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.execution.PlannerSuite\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.UnionZipRDDSuite\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-27T14:05:59Z","updated_at":"2023-07-14T00:24:33Z","closed_at":"2023-07-14T00:24:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95ec0f6d23b377dfbfdac1ba8a674b27e8681da9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jaceklaskowski","id":62313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski","html_url":"https://github.com/jaceklaskowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaceklaskowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fc404fcdecad0d04c61a95986b5c1945a35c3dcf","head":{"label":"zhmin:union_shuffle_pushdown","ref":"union_shuffle_pushdown","sha":"fc404fcdecad0d04c61a95986b5c1945a35c3dcf","user":{"login":"zhmin","id":10149923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQ5OTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10149923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":595026633,"node_id":"R_kgDOI3diyQ","name":"spark-master","full_name":"zhmin/spark-master","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhmin","id":10149923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQ5OTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10149923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhmin/spark-master","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to define Spark SQL types as keywords.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe non-keywords types cause some inconveniences while analysing/transforming the lexer tree. For example, while forming the stable column aliases, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40126.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRecently, Spark SQL supported `array_insert` and `array_prepend`. All implementations are individual.\r\nIn fact, `array_prepend` is special case of `array_insert` and we can reuse the `array_insert` by extends `RuntimeReplaceable`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify the implementation of `array_prepend`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new API of dropDuplicates which has following different characteristics compared to existing dropDuplicates:\r\n\r\n* Weaker constraints on the subset (key)\r\n  * Does not require an event time column on the subset.\r\n* Looser semantics on deduplication\r\n  * Only guarantee to deduplicate events within watermark delay.\r\n\r\nSince the new API leverages event time, the new API has following new requirements:\r\n\r\n* The watermark must be defined in the streaming DataFrame\r\n* The event time column must be defined in the streaming DataFrame.\r\n\r\nMore specifically on the semantic, once the operator processes the first arrived event, events arriving within the watermark for the first event will be deduplicated.\r\n(Technically, the expiration time should be the “event time of the first arrived event + watermark delay threshold”, to match up with future events.)\r\n\r\nUsers are encouraged to set the delay threshold of watermark longer than max timestamp differences among duplicated events. (If they are unsure, they can alternatively set the delay threshold large enough, e.g. 48 hours.)\r\n\r\nFor batch DataFrame, this is equivalent to the dropDuplicates.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the SS guide doc to introduce the new feature; screenshots below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"스크린샷 2023-04-06 오전 11 09 12\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/230254868-7fe76175-5883-4700-b018-d85d851799cb.png\">\r\n<img width=\"749\" alt=\"스크린샷 2023-04-06 오전 11 09 18\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/230254874-a754cdfd-2832-41dd-85b6-291f05eccb3d.png\">\r\n<img width=\"752\" alt=\"스크린샷 2023-04-06 오전 11 09 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/230254876-7fd7b3b1-f59d-481f-8249-5a4ae556c7cf.png\">\r\n<img width=\"751\" alt=\"스크린샷 2023-04-06 오전 11 09 29\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/230254880-79b158ca-3403-46a6-be4a-46618ec749db.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExisting dropDuplicates API does not address the valid use case on streaming query.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases where the event time is not exact the same, although these events are same. One example is duplicated events are produced due to non-idempotent writer where event time is issued from producer/broker side. Another example is that the value of event time is unstable and users want to use alternative timestamp e.g. ingestion time.\r\n\r\nFor these case, users have to exclude event time column from subset of deduplication, but then the operator is unable to evict state, leading to indefinitely growing state.\r\n\r\nTo allow eviction of state while event time column is not required to be a part of subset of deduplication, we need to loose the semantic for the API, which warrants a new API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this introduces a new public API,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe PR fixes the following bug in LCA + having resolution:\r\n```sql\r\nselect sum(value1) as total_1, total_1\r\nfrom values(1, 'name', 100, 50) AS data(id, name, value1, value2)\r\nhaving total_1 > 0\r\n\r\nSparkException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] Found the unresolved operator: 'UnresolvedHaving (total_1#353L > cast(0 as bigint))\r\n```\r\nTo trigger the issue, the having condition need to be (can be resolved by) an attribute in the select.\r\nWithout the LCA `total_1`, the query works fine.\r\n\r\n#### Root cause of the issue\r\n`UnresolvedHaving` with `Aggregate` as child can use both the `Aggregate`'s output and the `Aggregate`'s child's output to resolve the having condition. If using the latter, `ResolveReferences` rule will replace the unresolved attribute with a `TempResolvedColumn`.\r\nFor a `UnresolvedHaving` that actually can be resolved directly by its child `Aggregate`, there will be no `TempResolvedColumn` after the rule `ResolveReferences` applies. This  `UnresolvedHaving` still needs to be transformed to `Filter` by rule `ResolveAggregateFunctions`. This rule recognizes the shape: `UnresolvedHaving - Aggregate`.\r\nHowever, the current condition (the plan should not contain `TempResolvedColumn`) that prevents LCA rule to apply between `ResolveReferences` and `ResolveAggregateFunctions` does not cover the above case. It can insert `Project` in the middle and break the shape can be matched by `ResolveAggregateFunctions`.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nThe PR adds another condition for LCA rule to apply: the plan should not contain any `UnresolvedHaving`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSee above reasoning to fix the bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37353 introduce `o.a.spark.util.Iterators#size` to speed up get `Iterator` size when using Scala 2.13. It will only be used by `o.a.spark.util.Utils#getIteratorSize`, and will disappear when Spark only supports Scala 2.13.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd getString API for Dataset for usecases where string representation needs to be used other than stdout(println)\r\nMore details in the bug\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBut there are a lot of cases where we might need to get a String representation of the show output. For example\r\n\r\n logging framework to which we need to push the representation of a df\r\n send the string over a REST call from the driver\r\nsend the string to stderr instead of stdout\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested locally using
