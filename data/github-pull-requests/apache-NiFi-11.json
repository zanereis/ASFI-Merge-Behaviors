Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13097](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13097) Sets the current project version in Python Processors under the `nifi-python-extensions` directory using standard Maven resource filtering. Enabling resource filtering for the existing plugin configuration and setting the `version` field using the `project.version` placeholder allows the packaged Processor to reflect the current version.

SplitPcap processor, Pcap supporting class, and  attendant unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis processor is used to split a flowfile containing a large PCAP file (in binary format) into smaller files, depending on the max size set by the user. Each of the resultant flowfiles contains a valid PCAP that may be used as normal.\r\n\r\nIf the incoming PCAP is malformed, in the wrong format, or the incoming PCAP contains a packet that is larger than the maximum desired size, the incoming flowfile will be transferred to the 'failure' relationship and an 'error' attribute will be added to that flowfile stating the reason for failure.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

(up to date, locally modified, stale, etc.) on top of the material themed PG header surface (an appropriate text-shadow was added based on light/dark mode)\r\n- the run status icons on the top of the material themed PG detail banner surface\r\n- the not-transmitting and disabled icons when placed on top of the material themed header surfaces of a port or an RPG\r\n- the PG version control icons in the bottom PG breadcrumbs (an appropriate text-shadow was added based on light/dark mode)\r\n- the context menu icons in dark mode\r\n- the listing table header and selected styles\r\n- the navigation header, nifi logo, and the draggable icons\r\n- also cleans up a few typos (`mat-warn` -> `warn-color`) and added missing declarative colors\r\n- comments tooltip indicator on a canvas component fixed for both light and dark

This is in order to avoid potential issues with virus scanners which will quarantine such a file. In order to test an in memory Excel spreadsheet the underlying API com.github.pjfanning excel-streaming-reader had to be configured not to use temp files (which otherwise would have the same issue of being quarantined by virus scanners).\r\nThis PR is specifically for the 2.x branch but I am requesting this be back ported to the 1.x branch if possible otherwise I will open another PR.\r\n\r\n#

introduces default implementations for the method overloads `void commitAsync();` and `FlowFile merge(Collection<FlowFile> sources, FlowFile destination);`.\r\nAdditionally, removes the implementations of these methods from the implementors of the `ProcessSession` interface.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, where missing add null checks to implementations of `void commitAsync(Runnable onSuccess, Consumer<Throwable> onFailure);`  for the parameters `onSuccess` and `onFailure`, as these are defined as nullable.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13039](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13039)\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13042](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13042) Updates `Controller.py` and `ExtensionManager.py` to provide framework compatibility with Python 3.12.\r\n\r\nUpdates to `Controller.py` include joining to non-daemon threads at the conclusion of the `main` function, avoiding a `RuntimeError` thrown in Python 3.12 as a result of increased protections against spawning new child threads after finalization of the main process. This approach follows the recommendation from [CPython Issue 115533](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115533#issuecomment-1959143451). This is necessary for the NiFi `Controller.py` because the `main` function otherwise completes, but Py4J socket threads must continue running.\r\n\r\nUpdates to `ExtensionManager.py` include replacing the deprecated [find_module](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_module) method with the recommend [find_spec](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec) method. The `find_spec` method was added in Python 3.4 and `find_module` was removed in Python 3.12.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10977](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10977) Adds documentation on Apache NiFi Clustering with Kubernetes to the Admin Guide.\r\n\r\nAdditions include separate sections for ZooKeeper and Kubernetes under Basic Cluster Setup, and a new section on the Kubernetes ConfigMap State Provider implementation. This documentation focuses on the Apache NiFi configuration properties and the resource permissions required for running on Kubernetes. The purpose of these additions is to provide the integration points for Kubernetes clustering, without getting into the details of Kubernetes infrastructure considerations.\r\n\r\n#

changes will allow the processor to use Mongo updateMany operation in update mode.\r\nPutMongo processor was only doing `updateOne` in mongo operator mode. Now it has an additional configuration to select between `updateOne` and `updateMany`, which will help in clarifying the behavior of the processor to the user.\r\n\r\nA different name for update mode property is used in PutMongo than PutMongoRecord since the property name \"Update Mode\" is already used in PutMongo\r\n\r\nTest cases for `PutMongo` updated to use Map and Document classes instead of string based json input.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.
