What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `LimitPushDownThroughWindow` so that it no longer supports pushing down a limit through a window using ntile.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn an unpartitioned window, the ntile function is currently applied to the result of the limit. This behavior produces results that conflict with Spark 3.1.3, Hive 2.3.9 and Prestodb 0.268\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nAssume this data:\r\n```\r\ncreate table t1 stored as parquet as\r\nselect *\r\nfrom range(101);\r\n```\r\nAlso assume this query:\r\n```\r\nselect id, ntile(10) over (order by id) as nt\r\nfrom t1\r\nlimit 10;\r\n```\r\nWith Spark 3.2.2, Spark 3.3.0, and master, the limit is applied before the ntile function:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|id |nt |\r\n+---+---+\r\n|0  |1  |\r\n|1  |2  |\r\n|2  |3  |\r\n|3  |4  |\r\n|4  |5  |\r\n|5  |6  |\r\n|6  |7  |\r\n|7  |8  |\r\n|8  |9  |\r\n|9  |10 |\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\nWith Spark 3.1.3, and Hive 2.3.9, and Prestodb 0.268, the limit is applied _after_ ntile.\r\n\r\nSpark 3.1.3:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|id |nt |\r\n+---+---+\r\n|0

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose\r\n1. to support casting of the integral type: `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INT`, `BIGINT` to ANSI interval types.\r\n2. and remove the restriction of casting only single unit intervals.\r\n\r\nThis PR is complement to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36811.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform the SQL standard which allows such casting:\r\n<img width=\"801\" alt=\"173228149-17e1fbaa-c095-4eb7-bb3b-81a3f9c91928\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to support number-only column names in ORC data sources when orc impl is hive.\r\nIn the current master, with ORC datasource, we can write a DataFrame which contains such columns into ORC files.\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT 'a' as `1`, 'b' as `2`, 'c' as `3`\").write.orc(path)\r\n```\r\nBut reading the ORC files will fail.\r\n```tex\r\nval df = spark.read.orc(path)\r\n...\r\n== SQL ==\r\nstruct<1:string,2:string,3:string>\r\n-------^^^\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException.withCommand(ParseDriver.scala:265)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parse(ParseDriver.scala:126)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parseDataType(ParseDriver.scala:40)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.orc.OrcFileOperator$$anonfun$readSchema$2.applyOrElse(OrcFileOperator.scala:101)\r\n```\r\nThe cause of this is `CatalystSqlParser.parseDataType` fails to parse if a column name (and nested field) consists of only numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor better usability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the case\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"create table t1(a decimal(3, 0)) using parquet\")\r\nsql(\"insert into t1 values(100), (10), (1)\")\r\nsql(\"select * from t1 where a in(100000, 1.00)\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: After applying rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison in batch Operator Optimization before Inferring Filters, the structural integrity of the plan is broken.\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.structuralIntegrityIsBrokenAfterApplyingRuleError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:1325)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. the rule `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison` transforms the expression `In` to Equals\r\n\r\n```\r\nCAST(a as decimal(12,2)) IN (100000.00,1.00)\r\n\r\n\r\nOR(\r\n   CAST(a as decimal(12,2)) = 100000.00,\r\n   CAST(a as decimal(12,2)) = 1.00\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. using `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison.unwrapCast()` to optimize each `EqualTo`\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Expression1\r\nCAST(a as decimal(12,2)) = 100000.00 => CAST(a as decimal(12,2)) = 100000.00\r\n\r\n// Expression2\r\nCAST(a as decimal(12,2)) = 1.00      => a = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. return the new unwrapped cast expression `In`\r\n\r\n```\r\na IN (100000.00, 1.00)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n\r\nthe method `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison.unwrapCast()` returns the original expression when downcasting to a decimal type fails (the `Expression1`),returns the original expression if the downcast to the decimal type succeeds (the `Expression2`), the two expressions have different data type which would break the structural integrity\r\n\r\n```\r\na IN (100000.00, 1.00)\r\n       |           |\r\n    decimal(12, 2) |\r\n               decimal(3, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n\r\nthe PR transform the downcasting failed expression to `falseIfNotNull(fromExp)`\r\n```\r\n\r\n((isnull(a) AND null) OR a IN (1.00)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, only bug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

But when implement https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36829, misunderstand the meaning of `ArrayType.containsNull`,\r\nso when implement  `SQLOpenHashSet.withNullCheckCode()`\r\n```\r\n  def withNullCheckCode(\r\n      arrayContainsNull: Boolean,\r\n      setContainsNull: Boolean,\r\n      array: String,\r\n      index: String,\r\n      hashSet: String,\r\n      handleNotNull: (String, String) => String,\r\n      handleNull: String): String = {\r\n    if (arrayContainsNull) {\r\n      if (setContainsNull) {\r\n        s\"\"\"\r\n           |if ($array.isNullAt($index)) {\r\n           |  if (!$hashSet.containsNull()) {\r\n           |    $hashSet.addNull();\r\n           |    $handleNull\r\n           |  }\r\n           |} else {\r\n           |  ${handleNotNull(array, index)}\r\n           |}\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n      } else {\r\n        s\"\"\"\r\n           |if (!$array.isNullAt($index)) {\r\n           | ${handleNotNull(array, index)}\r\n           |}\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n      }\r\n    } else {\r\n      handleNotNull(array, index)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe code path of `  if (arrayContainsNull && setContainsNull) `  is misinterpreted that array's openHashSet really have a null value. \r\n\r\nIn this pr we add a new parameter `additionalCondition ` to complements the previous implementation of `foundNullElement`. Also refactor the method's parameter name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix data correct issue\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to:\r\n- Suppress error logs when the number of timers is set to 0.\r\n- Add documentation for describing its behaviour clearly:\r\n  - 0: disable the feature\r\n  - -1: no limit\r\n  - Otherwise, explicit limit.\r\n- Throw an exception if the configuration is set to the number lower than -1.\r\n    This is an internal configuration, numbers lower than -1 don't make much sense, and this configuration sort of less known. So I think it's pretty safe to do this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid noisy error logs, and document the feature properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. When `spark.scheduler.listenerbus.metrics.maxListenerClassesTimed` is set to `0`, it does not show a warning such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLiveListenerBusMetrics: Not measuring processing time for listener class org.apache.spark.sql.util.ExecutionListenerBus because a maximum of 0 listener classes are already timed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest is added.","created_at":"2022-08-08T05:54:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:49:52Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T09:58:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"320d015bb4f81d258559b9f38daa701d01809261","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0140245fe8d053598e470fa67b949ed36bfc5bf2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-39973","ref":"SPARK-39973","sha":"0140245fe8d053598e470fa67b949ed36bfc5bf2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdate INSERTs without user-specified fields to not automatically add default values.\r\n\r\nFor example, with the new behavior, this `INSERT INTO` command will fail with an error message reporting that the table has two columns but the command only inserted one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t (a INT DEFAULT 1, b INT DEFAULT 2) USING PARQUET;\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES (42);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor INSERTs with user-specified fields, these commands may now specify fewer field/value pairs than the number of columns in the target table. The analyzer will assign the default value for each remaining column (either NULL, or else the explicit DEFAULT value assigned to the column from a previous command).\r\n\r\nFor example, with the new behavior, this `INSERT INTO` command will succeed, assigning the new row `(42, 2)` to the target table:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t (a INT DEFAULT 1, b INT DEFAULT 2) USING PARQUET;\r\nINSERT INTO t (a) VALUES (42);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo implement this behavior, this PR creates the following config which is true by default:\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.defaultColumn.addMissingValuesForInsertsWithExplicitColumns`\r\n\r\nTo switch back to the previous behavior of returning errors for `INSERT INTO` commands with fewer user-specified fields than the number of columns in the target table, switch this new config to false.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter looking at desired SQL semantics, it is

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAQE uses statistics from completed query stages and feeds them back into the logical optimizer. AQE currently only uses `dataSize` and `numOutputRows` and ignores any available `attributeMap` (column statistics).\r\n\r\nThis PR updates AQE to also populate `attributeMap` in the statistics that it uses for re-optimizing the plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed so that Spark plugins that provide custom implementations of the `ShuffleExchangeLike` trait can leverage column statistics for better plan optimization during AQE execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. The current Spark implementation of `ShuffleExchangeLike` (`ShuffleExchangeExec`) does not populate `attributeMap`, so this PR is a no-op for regular Spark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew unit test added.","created_at":"2022-08-05T21:56:07Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T21:18:33Z","closed_at":"2022-09-19T21:18:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0f1bac969e4c8bcd334dea11a991e999b61dcb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0fecf7c7a5497a40c88c537d7c83d8744cb5c54c","head":{"label":"andygrove:aqe-column-stats","ref":"aqe-column-stats","sha":"0fecf7c7a5497a40c88c537d7c83d8744cb5c54c","user":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205463461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU0NjM0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"andygrove/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEnable implicit DEFAULT column values in inserts from DataFrames.\r\n\r\nThis mostly already worked since the DataFrame inserts already converted to LogicalPlans. I added testing and a small analysis change since the operators are resolved one-by-one instead of all at once.\r\n\r\nNote that explicit column \"default\" references are not supported in write operations from DataFrames: since the operators are resolved one-by-one, any `.select` referring to \"default\" generates a \"column not found\" error before any following `.insertInto`.\r\n\r\n###

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a correctness issue in Parquet DSv1 FileFormat when projection does not contain columns referenced in pushed filters. This typically happens when partition columns and data columns overlap.\r\n\r\nThis could result in empty result when in fact there were records matching predicate as can be seen in the provided fields.\r\n\r\nThe problem is especially visible with `count()` and `show()` reporting different results, for example, show() would return 1+ records where the count() would return 0.\r\n\r\nIn Parquet, when the predicate is provided and column index is enabled, we would try to filter row ranges to figure out what the count should be. Unfortunately, there is an issue that if the projection is empty or is not in the set of filter columns, any checks on columns would fail and 0 rows are returned (`RowRanges.EMPTY`) even though there is data matching the filter.\r\n\r\nNote that this is rather a mitigation, a quick fix. The actual fix needs to go into Parquet-MR: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-2170.\r\n\r\nThe fix is not required in DSv2 where the overlapping columns are removed in `FileScanBuilder::readDataSchema()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a correctness issue when projection columns are not referenced by columns in pushed down filters or the schema is empty in Parquet DSv1.\r\n\r\nDownsides: Parquet column filter would be disabled if it had not been explicitly enabled which could affect performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test that reproduces this behaviour. The test fails without the fix and passes with the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support two new executor rolling policies.\r\n- `PEAK_JVM_ONHEAP_MEMORY` policy chooses an executor with the biggest peak JVM on-heap memory.\r\n- `PEAK_JVM_OFFHEAP_MEMORY` policy chooses an executor with the biggest peak JVM off-heap memory.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough peak memory is a kind of historic value, these two new policies add a capability to maintain the memory usage of Spark jobs minimally as much as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but this is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated some `spark.io.compression` configuration descriptions to clarify parameter application scope.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsers are easily confused and mistakenly think that these parameters can be applied to sparksql.\r\n\r\nFor example, the user wants to write a parquet file and set some compression configurations such as zstd level (as the following code). In the original document, user found that there is a `spark.io.compression.zstd.level` in the relevant configuration, which seems to be the desired configuration, but after using it, it is found that it does not take effect, which will make users confused.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    sparkSession.sessionState.newHadoopConfWithOptions(   \r\n      \"spark.io.compression.zstd.level\" -> \"10\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    df.coalesce(1).write.parquet(\"file:///home/test_data/nn_parq_10\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-05T03:14:24Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T19:11:28Z","closed_at":"2022-08-10T19:11:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47344d8cd37c278827e45aec1adea9f0d18f1937","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3443415aa91687f0a017d8e1d4d34c603f88fe1","head":{"label":"zzzzming95:SPARK-39743-doc","ref":"SPARK-39743-doc","sha":"d3443415aa91687f0a017d8e1d4d34c603f88fe1","user":{"login":"zzzzming95","id":13965087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTY1MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13965087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzming95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":509960044,"node_id":"R_kgDOHmVfbA","name":"spark","full_name":"zzzzming95/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zzzzming95","id":13965087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTY1MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13965087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzming95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzming95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzming95/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is a refactor of `SessionCatalog`. It centralizes the code of qualifying identifiers in one place: `SessionCatalog.qualifyIdentifier`. Then we can call `qualifyIdentifier` in places (mostly in `SessionCatalog`) where we get the current database and format names manually before.\r\n\r\nAttaching the v1 catalog name is also kind of qualifying identifiers, and is included in `SessionCatalog.qualifyIdentifier` as well in this PR. This simplifies the code of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37021 : now we only need to attach the v1 catalog name in one place, instead of spreading out many places.\r\n\r\nThis also improves the v1 command resolution: now `ResolveSessionCatalog` uses qualified identifiers when falling back to v1 command, while before we only attach the v1 catalog name. This avoids potential issues that the v1 command execution may qualify the identifiers differently (e.g. current database changes).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37283. It missed `throw` keyword in the interpreted path.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo throw an exception as intended instead of returning an exception itself.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will throw an exception as expected in the interpreted path.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHaven't tested because it's too much

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue raised in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39983 - broadcast relations should not be cached on the driver as they are not needed and can cause significant memory pressure (in one case the relation was 60MB )\r\n\r\nThe PR adds a new SparkContext.broadcastInternal method with parameter serializedOnly allowing the caller to specify that the broadcasted object should be stored only in serialized form. The current behavior is to also cache an unserialized form of the object.\r\n\r\nThe PR changes the broadcast implementation in TorrentBroadcast to honor the serializedOnly flag and not store the unserialized value, unless the execution is in a local mode (single process). In that case the broadcast cache is effectively shared between driver and executors and thus the unserialized value needs to be cached to satisfy the executor-side of the functionality.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe broadcast relations can be fairly large (observed 60MB one) and are not needed in unserialized form on the driver.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit test to BroadcastSuite verifying the low-level broadcast functionality in respect to the serializedOnly flag.\r\nAdded a new unit test to BroadcastExchangeSuite verifying that broadcasted relations are not cached on the driver.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-05T01:25:08Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T18:04:09Z","closed_at":"2022-08-11T00:13:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"adc5b2ee3dee65a96b7344c7051e4a467bc715d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6a725a840ee7f56c633e5384a182c56f78aeeba1","head":{"label":"alex-balikov:SPARK-39983-broadcast-no-cache","ref":"SPARK-39983-broadcast-no-cache","sha":"6a725a840ee7f56c633e5384a182c56f78aeeba1","user":{"login":"alex-balikov","id":91913242,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXp8Gg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91913242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-balikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467787380,"node_id":"R_kgDOG-HedA","name":"spark","full_name":"alex-balikov/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alex-balikov","id":91913242,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXp8Gg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91913242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-balikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alex-balikov/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to provide a method to lower the timeout. Our solution is to ask master for worker’s heartbeat when Driver does not receive heartbeat from executor for `TimeoutThreshold` seconds.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-01 at 6 10 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20109646/182272331-2f972aa8-31c9-4c3e-8c88-b7cf2616fad8.png)\r\n\r\nWhen Executor performs full GC, it cannot send any message during full GC. Next, Driver cannot receive heartbeat from Executor. Instead of removing the executor directly, driver will ask master for `workerLastHeartbeat`. Driver will determine whether it is network disconnection or other issues (e.g. GC) based on `workerLastHeartbeat`. If it is network disconnection, we will remove the executor. Otherwise, we will put the executor into `executorExpiryCandidates` rather than expiring it immediately.\r\n\r\n[Note 1]\r\nWorker will send heartbeats to Master every `(conf.get(WORKER_TIMEOUT) * 1000 / 4)` milliseconds. Check deploy/worker/Worker.scala for more details. It is good to keep `expiryCandidatesTimeout` larger than `(conf.get(WORKER_TIMEOUT) * 1000 / 4)` to know whether master lost any heartbeat from the worker or not.\r\n\r\n[Note 2]\r\nWe can also use this method for other deployment methods, but not every deployment method schedules driver on master.\r\n\r\n* Result\r\n  * Milestone 4:\r\n    * `HEARTBEAT_RECEIVER_CHECK_WORKER_LAST_HEARTBEAT`: true \r\n    * `NETWORK_EXECUTOR_TIMEOUT` (TimeoutThreshold in the figures): 60s\r\n    * `HEARTBEAT_EXPIRY_CANDIDATES_TIMEOUT`: 30s\r\n    * `NETWORK_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL`: 15s\r\n  * w/o Milestone 4 \r\n    * `HEARTBEAT_RECEIVER_CHECK_WORKER_LAST_HEARTBEAT`: false \r\n    * `NETWORK_EXECUTOR_TIMEOUT` (TimeoutThreshold in the figures): 120s\r\n    * `NETWORK_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL`: 60s\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-01 at 6 54 51 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20109646/182275086-474d7458-f2a8-473c-adb2-c13f5c942ea1.png)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the driver’s HeartbeatReceiver will expire an executor if it does not receive any heartbeat from the executor for 120 seconds. However, 120 seconds is too long, but we will face other challenges when we try to lower the timeout threshold. To elaborate, when an executor is performing GC, it cannot reply any message.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-01 at 6 03 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20109646/182269820-4802877d-a4e4-4d20-969d-6ece37ffdb55.png)\r\n\r\nWe will use the above figure to explain why we cannot lower `TimeoutThreshold` to 60 seconds directly. When Executor performs full GC, it cannot send any message, including heartbeat. Next, driver will remove the executor because driver cannot receive heartbeat from Executor for 60 seconds. In other words, we cannot distinguish between GC and network disconnection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implemented a ThrottledLogger, a logger with RateLimiters, to prevent  log message flooding caused by network issues. In our ThrottledLogger, we enable users to register prefixes. Each prefix has its RateLimiter, and each prefix has its rate limit strategy (by setting different value of `throttlingSeconds`). Each RateLimiter will create a permit per second, and printing a message needs to acquire `throttlingSeconds` permits. For example, \r\n\r\n```java\r\nThrottledLogger tlogger = new ThrottledLogger(\"ThrottledLogger\");\r\ntlogger.registerPrefix(\"msg\", 2); // Printing a message with the prefix \"msg\" consumes 2 permits.\r\n\r\n// will be printed\r\ntlogger.info(\"msg1\"); \r\n\r\n// The RateLimiter of prefix \"msg\" does not have enough permits. => will not be printed\r\ntlogger.info(\"msg2\"); \r\n\r\n// The message which does not match with any registered prefix will always be printed.\r\ntlogger.info(\"abc\"); \r\n\r\n// Sleep two seconds, and the RateLimiter will get 2 permits.\r\nThread.sleep(2000);\r\n\r\n// The RateLimiter of the prefix \"msg\" has enough permits. => print\r\ntlogger.info(\"msg3\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen transient network error occurs, Spark may write out a large volume of error logs related to the network errors. The excessive logging can create further problems downstream, e.g. blow up our log storage. If we can combine / batch the network errors when they come in a burst, we only print out periodic summaries of errors that are happening repeatedly in a short time window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"network-common/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds UNPIVOT clause to SQL syntax. It follows the same syntax as  [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unpivot_operator), [T-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot?view=sql-server-ver15#unpivot-example), [Oracle](https://www.oracletutorial.com/oracle-basics/oracle-unpivot/):\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM ... [ unpivot_clause ]\r\n\r\nunpivot_clause:\r\n    UNPIVOT [ { INCLUDE | EXCLUDE } NULLS ] (\r\n        { single_value_column_unpivot | multi_value_column_unpivot }\r\n    ) [[AS] alias]\r\n\r\nsingle_value_column_unpivot:\r\n    values_column\r\n    FOR name_column\r\n    IN (unpivot_column [[AS] alias] [, ...])\r\n\r\nmulti_value_column_unpivot:\r\n    (values_column [,

(\r\n        sales FOR quarter IN (q1 AS Q1, q2 AS Q2, q3 AS Q3, q4 AS Q4)\r\n    ) AS up;\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM sales_quarterly\r\n    UNPIVOT EXCLUDE NULLS (\r\n        (first_quarter,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSolve the data skew on the stream side in `BroadcastHashJoin`\r\n- When data skew needs to introduce additional shuffle, support forcibly solve the data skew problem through `spark.sql.adaptive.forceOptimizeSkewedJoin`\r\n- If data skew optimization is performed, `LocalShuffle` optimization will not be performed, otherwise the skew optimization will not take effect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the actual production environment, data skew will slow down the task execution

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixed memory leak caused by not clearing the FileStatusCache created by calling FileStatusCache.getOrCreate when close a SparkSession of Spark Thrift Server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen create many sessions in Spark Thrift Server and do querys in each session, the fileStatus of files related will be cached.\r\nBut these filestatus will not be cleared when these sessions are closed, the memory leak causes Driver OOM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange infra image to static tag: ubuntu:focal-20220801 (current latest 20.04). This patch don't bring any real change on image because ubuntu:20.04 and ubuntu:focal-20220801 are point to same hash at current time.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ docker run -ti ubuntu:focal-20220801 bash\r\nDigest: sha256:af5efa9c28de78b754777af9b4d850112cad01899a5d37d2617bb94dc63a49aa\r\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:focal-20220801\r\n\r\n$ docker run -ti ubuntu:20.04 bash\r\nDigest: sha256:af5efa9c28de78b754777af9b4d850112cad01899a5d37d2617bb94dc63a49aa\r\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:20.04\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The `ubuntu:20.04` is not a static tag, it is for ubuntu latest 20.04 version, Ubuntu upgrades the version [every 1-2 months](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/commits/master/library/ubuntu).\r\n- If we don't pin the ubuntu version to specific static tag, once the ubuntu upgrade the version, the image cache will be outdate. Then the infra image of CI job will do full refresh, it makes CI unstable just like SPARK-39831 .\r\n\r\nSo, we need a planned upgrade of Ubuntu in infra to aovid unstable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-04T03:51:36Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T13:48:16Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T13:48:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b01d0a341642b1976f9651e4feafa208eabda467","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8994c58a753a682cd2d4279b41609d07896412c","head":{"label":"Yikun:patch-33","ref":"patch-33","sha":"f8994c58a753a682cd2d4279b41609d07896412c","user":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335541670,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU1NDE2NzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"Yikun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCreate separate static image tag for infra static image\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, we put the **static image** and **cache** together in same tag like [`ghcr.io/apache/spark/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache:master`](https://github.com/apache/spark/pkgs/container/spark%2Fapache-spark-github-action-image-cache/versions).\r\n\r\nCache and static image occupy separate different image hash and same image tags. this bring some problem in below cases:\r\n- **Debug job with static docker images**, they have to find hash. If use cache directly, will raise something like:\r\n```\r\nyikun-x86:~# docker run -ti ghcr.io/yikun/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache:master\r\nUnable to find image 'ghcr.io/yikun/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache:master' locally\r\nmaster: Pulling from yikun/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache\r\ndocker: no matching manifest for linux/amd64 in the manifest list entries.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Use static image in CI**, such as for some reason we want to switch static image temporarily.\r\n- **Easy to see history for last cache**, such as system deps/lib.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Local test: https://github.com/Yikun/spark/pull/144, and static image tag push [passed](https://github.com/Yikun/spark/runs/7664266955?check_suite_focus=true#step:6:212)\r\n- Run static image:\r\n```\r\nroot@yikun-x86:~# docker run -ti ghcr.io/yikun/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache:master-static\r\nUnable to find image 'ghcr.io/yikun/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache:master-static' locally\r\nmaster-static: Pulling from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen onDisconnected is triggered,\r\n\r\n(1) Delay `RemoveExecutor` for 5 seconds to enable driver receives ExecutorExitCode from slow path\r\n(2) Prevent task scheduler from assigning tasks on the lost executor. (By adding the executor to `executorsPendingLossReason`)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are two methods to detect executor loss.\r\n\r\n(1) (fast path) `onDisconnected` Executor -> Driver:\r\nWhen Executor closes its JVM, the socket (Netty's channel) will be closed. The function onDisconnected will be triggered when it knows the channel is closed.\r\n\r\n(2) (slow path) ExecutorRunner -> Worker -> Master -> Driver (See #37385  for details)\r\nWhen executor exits with ExecutorExitCode, the exit code will be passed from ExecutorRunner to Driver.\r\n\r\nBecause fast path determines the executor loss without the information of ExecutorExitCode, these two methods may categorize same cases into different conclusions. For example, when Executor exits with ExecutorExitCode HEARTBEAT_FAILURE, onDisconnected will consider the executor loss as a task failure, but slow path will consider it as a network failure. Obviously, HEARTBEAT_FAILURE is a network failure.\r\n\r\n[Notice]\r\nFor more details about ExecutorExitCode, check #37385 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nGlobal limit can not promise the output ordering is same with child, it actually depend on the certain physical plan.\r\n\r\nFor all physical plan with gobal limits:\r\n- CollectLimitExec: it does not promise output ordering\r\n- GlobalLimitExec: it required all tuples so it can assume the child is shuffle or child is single partition. Then it can use output ordering of child\r\n- TakeOrderedAndProjectExec: it do sort inside it's implementation\r\n\r\nThis bug get worse since we pull out v1 write require ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nGlobal limit can not promise the output ordering is same with child, it actually depend on the certain physical plan.\r\n\r\nFor all physical plan with gobal limits:\r\n- CollectLimitExec: it does not promise output ordering\r\n- GlobalLimitExec: it required all tuples so it can assume the child is shuffle or child is single partition. Then it can use output ordering of child\r\n- TakeOrderedAndProjectExec: it do sort inside it's implementation\r\n\r\nThis bug get worse since we pull out v1 write require ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen counting the number of successful tasks in the stage of spark, spark uses the indicator of `tasksSuccessful`, but in fact, the success or failure of tasks is based on the array of `successful`. Through the log, it is found that the number of failed tasks counted by `tasksSuccessful` is inconsistent with the number of failures stored in the array of `successful`. We should take `successful` as the standard.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nStatistics on the number of successful tasks is more accurate.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUse origin tests.","created_at":"2022-08-03T07:48:42Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T13:45:07Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T13:45:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d2291267f781581f7bcd381cd344976675661ee5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/379a2caaee6f13e1adfb667f521e48b6f836e625","head":{"label":"smallzhongfeng:tasksSuccessful-count","ref":"tasksSuccessful-count","sha":"379a2caaee6f13e1adfb667f521e48b6f836e625","user":{"login":"smallzhongfeng","id":84573424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTczNDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84573424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/smallzhongfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439328511,"node_id":"R_kgDOGi-e_w","name":"spark","full_name":"smallzhongfeng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"smallzhongfeng","id":84573424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTczNDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84573424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/smallzhongfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallzhongfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/smallzhongfeng/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`SimplifyCasts` is a optimize rule used to removes `Cast` that are unnecessary because the input is already the correct type.\r\nCurrently, the implementation of `SimplifyCasts` seems a little redundant. `Cast.canUpCast` can completely cover the function of `isWiderCast`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `SimplifyCastsSuite` does't cover the case when `from` is non-numeric and `to` is numeric. This PR add a new test case for this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify the implementation of `SimplifyCasts`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-03T03:52:36Z","updated_at":"2022-08-06T02:49:09Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T10:37:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d72161cb3fea1adaa71deb726b067ff91f2bd7bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/99bf97161f3c2c1e09c370e3e012f772676ce89f","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-39963","ref":"SPARK-39963","sha":"99bf97161f3c2c1e09c370e3e012f772676ce89f","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, DS V2 push-down translate `Cast` only if the ansi mode is true.\r\nIn fact, if the cast is safe(e.g. cast number to string, cast int to long), we can translate it too.\r\n\r\nThis PR will call `Cast.canUpCast` so as we can translate `Cast` to V2 `Cast` safely.\r\n\r\nNote: The rule `SimplifyCasts` optimize some safe cast, e.g. cast int to long, so we may not see the `Cast`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd the range for DS V2 push down `Cast`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\n`Cast` could be pushed down to data source in more cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest cases updated.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-03T03:37:25Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T01:34:41Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T16:59:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d98b033dd57a3b7547257c4ee414019cb7aaa52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/feb2a131a14b91359ea9d95cdbed548b48d3aabf","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-39961","ref":"SPARK-39961","sha":"feb2a131a14b91359ea9d95cdbed548b48d3aabf","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpgrade mysql-connector-java from 8.0.29 to 8.0.30\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis version brings some bugs fixes, the release note as follows:\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/connector-j/8.0/en/news-8-0-30.html\r\nBugs Fixed, eg:\r\n> Historically, MySQL Server has used utf8 as an alias for utf8mb3. Since release 8.0.29, utf8mb3 has become a recognized (though deprecated) character set on its own for MySQL Server and to make things consistent, in release 8.0.30, any collations prefixed with utf8_ are now prefixed with utf8mb3_ instead. To go with that change, Connector/J has updated its character set and collation mapping accordingly in this release, and users are encouraged to update to Connector/J 8.0.30 to avoid potential issues when working with MySQL Server 8.0.30 or later. (Bug #34090350)\r\n\r\n> The description for the connection property rewriteBatchedStatements has been corrected, removing the limitation that server-sided prepared statements could not take advantage of the rewrite option. (Bug #34022110)\r\n\r\n> DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo always returned false for AUTO_INCREMENT for all data types. With this fix, Connector/J returns the correct value for each data type. Also, the missing types DOUBLE UNSIGNED and DOUBLE PRECISION UNSIGNED have been added to the ResultSet. (Bug #106758, Bug #33973048)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n### Q1. How many ExecutorExitCode do we have?\r\nBased on ExecutorExitCode.scala, we found there are 4 ExecutorExitCode.\r\n* `DISK_STORE_FAILED_TO_CREATE_DIR`: Executor has a variable BlockManager (`env.blockManager`), and BlockManager will create a DiskBlockManager when it initializes. When a DiskBlockManager is created, it will try to create a local directory. As shown in the following code snippet, if the directory creation is fail, DiskBlockManager will close the JVM with the exit code `DISK_STORE_FAILED_TO_CREATE_DIR`.\r\n```scala\r\nprivate[spark] val localDirs: Array[File] = createLocalDirs(conf)\r\nif (localDirs.isEmpty) {\r\n  logError(\"Failed to create any local dir.\")\r\n  System.exit(ExecutorExitCode.DISK_STORE_FAILED_TO_CREATE_DIR)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `EXTERNAL_BLOCK_STORE_FAILED_TO_INITIALIZE`: Unused\r\n* `EXTERNAL_BLOCK_STORE_FAILED_TO_CREATE_DIR`: Unused\r\n* `HEARTBEAT_FAILURE`: When an Executor is created, it will start a Heartbeater thread to execute the function `reportHeartBeat()` periodically. The function `reportHeartBeat()` will send a heartbeat to driver. If the heartbeater does not receive the response in time, it will increment `heartbeatFailures` by one. When the value of `heartbeatFailures` is higher or equal to `HEARTBEAT_MAX_FAILURES`, the heartbeater will close the JVM with the exit code `ExecutorExitCode.HEARTBEAT_FAILURE`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nif (heartbeatFailures >= HEARTBEAT_MAX_FAILURES) {\r\n  logError(s\"Exit as unable to send heartbeats to driver \" +\r\n    s\"more than $HEARTBEAT_MAX_FAILURES times\")\r\n  System.exit(ExecutorExitCode.HEARTBEAT_FAILURE)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Q2. How does ExecutorExitCode pass to driver?\r\nIn ExecutorRunner, an Executor will be run as a new process. Hence, Executor is running in a different JVM. When Executor called the function `System.exit(...)` to close Executor's JVM, the exitCode will be returned to ExecutorRunner. Then, Executor will send the exit code to Worker. \r\n\r\n* A high-level overview: **ExecutorRunner -> Worker -> Master -> Driver**\r\n\r\nHere, I will talk more details about how does the Executor exit code pass from ExecutorRunner to Driver.\r\n\r\n1. ExecutorRunner sends an `ExecutorStateChanged` message to Worker.\r\n```scala\r\nval exitCode = process.waitFor()\r\nstate = ExecutorState.EXITED\r\nval message = \"Command exited with code \" + exitCode\r\nworker.send(ExecutorStateChanged(appId, execId, state, Some(message), Some(exitCode)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. When Worker receives the `ExecutorStateChanged` message, Worker will forward the message to Master.\r\n```scala\r\nsyncExecutorStateWithMaster(executorStateChanged)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. When Master receives the `ExecutorStateChanged` message, it will use the exit code to create an `ExecutorUpdated` message and send the message to StandaloneAppClient (Driver).\r\n```scala\r\nexec.application.driver.send(ExecutorUpdated(execId, state, message, exitStatus, None))\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. When StandaloneAppClient receives the `ExecutorUpdated` message, it will call the function `executorRemoved` (SchedulerBackend's function) and the function assumes every executor exit is caused by task failure (`exitCausedByApp = true`).\r\n```scala\r\nlistener.executorRemoved(fullId, message.getOrElse(\"\"), exitStatus, workerHost)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\noverride def executorRemoved(\r\n    fullId: String,\r\n    message: String,\r\n    exitStatus: Option[Int],\r\n    workerHost: Option[String]): Unit = {\r\n  val reason: ExecutorLossReason = exitStatus match {\r\n    case Some(code) => ExecutorExited(code, exitCausedByApp = true, message)\r\n    case None => ExecutorProcessLost(message, workerHost)\r\n  }\r\n  logInfo(\"Executor %s removed: %s\".format(fullId, message))\r\n  removeExecutor(fullId.split(\"/\")(1), reason)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Q3. How to determine `exitCausedByApp` based on ExecutorExitCode?\r\n* `DISK_STORE_FAILED_TO_CREATE_DIR` => hardware failure => `exitCausedByApp = false`\r\n* `HEARTBEAT_FAILURE` => network failure => `exitCausedByApp = false`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are a lot of possible reasons to cause an executor exit. However, the driver will assume every executor exit is caused by task failure. As shown in the following code snippet, `StandaloneSchedulerBackend` will determine the executor exit is caused by task failure (`exitCausedByApp = true`) no matter the value of ExecutorExitCode (`code`).\r\n\r\n```scala\r\noverride def executorRemoved(\r\n    fullId: String,\r\n    message: String,\r\n    exitStatus: Option[Int],\r\n    workerHost: Option[String]): Unit = {\r\n  val reason: ExecutorLossReason = exitStatus match {\r\n    case Some(code) => ExecutorExited(code, exitCausedByApp = true, message)\r\n    case None => ExecutorProcessLost(message, workerHost)\r\n  }\r\n  logInfo(\"Executor %s removed: %s\".format(fullId, message))\r\n  removeExecutor(fullId.split(\"/\")(1), reason)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe assumption is wrong. For example, when DiskBlockManager on Executor fails to create a directory, it will close executor’s JVM with the exit code `DISK_STORE_FAILED_TO_CREATE_DIR`. Obviously, when the driver received the exit code `DISK_STORE_FAILED_TO_CREATE_DIR`, the executor exit is caused by hardware failure rather than task failure. Hence, this pull request aims to determine whether the executor exit is caused by task failures or not based on ExecutorExitCode.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we should to understand three questions:\r\n\r\n* Q1. How many ExecutorExitCode do we have?\r\n* Q2. How does ExecutorExitCode pass to driver?\r\n* Q3. How to determine `exitCausedByApp` based on ExecutorExitCode?\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n[TODO] We need to test this PR with the support of other PR. \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-03T01:12:45Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T05:07:08Z","closed_at":"2022-08-03T22:27:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83aaceeb02abb12973fefc97db039085f0b39b3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37385/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37385/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37385/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7bd21f4cd81a83db23787ecefc66c0ab0013f502","head":{"label":"kevin85421:SPARK-39956","ref":"SPARK-39956","sha":"7bd21f4cd81a83db23787ecefc66c0ab0013f502","user":{"login":"kevin85421","id":20109646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTA5NjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20109646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421","html_url":"https://github.com/kevin85421","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":435669271,"node_id":"R_kgDOGffJFw","name":"spark","full_name":"kevin85421/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevin85421","id":20109646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTA5NjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20109646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421","html_url":"https://github.com/kevin85421","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevin85421/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevin85421/spark","description":"Apache

Non-Task Failure: Driver does not send any LaunchTask message to Executor, and thus there is no running task on Executor. It is impossible to be Task Failure.\r\n\r\nB. Non-Task Failure: If a RPC failure happens before receiving the StatusUpdate message from Executor, it is Non-Task Failure because the task does not start to run in Executor.\r\n\r\nC. Task Failure: If there is any running task in the Executor, we will recognize the RPC failure as Task Failure.\r\n\r\nD. Non-Task Failure: There is no running task on the Executor when all tasks on the Executor are in finished states (FINISHED, FAILED, KILLED, LOST). Hence, the RPC failures in this phase are Non-Task Failure.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are two possible reasons, including Non-Task Failure and Task Failure, to make RPC failures.\r\n\r\n(1) Task Failure: The network is good, but the task causes the executor's JVM crash. Hence, RPC fails.\r\n(2) Non-Task Failure: The executor works well, but the network between Driver and Executor is broken. Hence, RPC fails.\r\n\r\nWe should handle these two different kinds of failure in different ways. First, if the failure is Task Failure, we should increment the variable `numFailures`. If the value of `numFailures` is larger than a threshold, Spark will label the job failed. Second, if the failure is Non-Task Failure, we will not increment the variable `numFailures`. We will just assign the task to a new executor. Hence, the job will not be recognized as failed due to Non-Task Failure.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently, Spark recognizes every RPC failure as Task Failure. Hence, this PR aims to categorize RPC failures into two categories, Task Failure and Network Failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use canonical host name for principals in KafkaTestUtils.\r\n\r\nThis is effectively reverting a part of SPARK-39530, as we used the canonical host name before SPARK-39530. (We used IP as \"127.0.0.1\" (loopback) and the host part of principal as the canonical host name of \"127.0.0.1\") Picking up the actual IP to use IPv6 if appropriate remains unchanged from SPARK-39530.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nKafkaDelegationTokenSuite fails on AWS EC2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan KafkaDelegationTokenSuite in AWS EC2 via following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql-kafka-0-10/testOnly *KafkaDelegationTokenSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis suite failed on current master branch and succeeds with this PR.\r\n\r\nkerberos debug message on failure (only picked up the last error part as it's quite long and I need to redact):\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>>KRBError:\r\n\t

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSimilar with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37313, currently, when  arithmetic overflow errors happen under ANSI mode, the error messages are like\r\n```\r\n[ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW] long overflow. Use 'try_multiply' to tolerate overflow and return NULL instead. If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to \"false\" \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"(except for ANSI interval type)\" part is confusing. We should remove it for the numeric arithmetic operations and have a new error class for the interval division error: `INTERVAL_ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better error messages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Use different error classes for arithmetic overflows of numeric/interval.. After changes, the error messages are simpler and more clear.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

is for backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37330 into branch-3.3\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptimize Global sort to RepartitionByExpression, for example:\r\n```\r\nSort local             Sort local\r\n  Sort global    =>      RepartitionByExpression\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf a global sort below a local sort, the only meaningful thing is it's distribution. So this pr optimizes that global sort to RepartitionByExpression to save a local sort.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nwe fix a bug in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37250 and that pr backport into branch-3.3. However, that fix may introduce performance regression. This pr itself is only to improve performance but in order to avoid the regression, we also backport this pr. see the details https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37330#issuecomment-1201979396\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd test\r\n\r\nCloses #37330 from ulysses-you/optimize-sort.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by:

to @pranavanand on figuring out the issue and providing the broken test code!\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to refresh the destination catalog table when streaming query is writing to the catalog table via DSv1 sink.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt has been a long standing issue that streaming query is not aware of catalog table (not the table brought by DSv2), hence no way for streaming query to refresh the catalog table after updating it. As a side effect of SPARK-39564, Spark brings up the information of destination catalog table into MicrobatchExecution, which enables to refresh table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe normally store the tableSchema in table properties rather than as an actual schema. We normally do this as it helps bypass some hive-metastore issues including the parsing with the SparkSQLDataType parser.\r\n\r\nHowever, the issue is that we were not emptying out the tableSchema for spark views (which are incompatible with Hive to start with). Thus, the hive DataType parser would try to parse the schema and it would break. The fix is to empty out the tableSchema for spark views when saving them to Hive Metastore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes the following bug:\r\n```\r\n-- this works since we use backticks in `date-of-creation`\r\ncreate table table_with_hyphen (f array<struct<validColumnTypeName:string>>) using parquet;\r\n-- this should work since we use backticks in `date-of-creation` but will break without this bugfix\r\ncreate or replace view view_with_hyphen as select f from table_with_hyphen;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nBugfix as described above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested in spark and added a unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding a new `array_sort` overload to `org.apache.spark.sql.functions` that matches the new overload defined in [SPARK-29020](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29020) and added via #25728.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdds access to the new overload for users of the DataFrame API so that they don't need to use the `expr` escape hatch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, now allows users to optionally provide a comparator function to the `array_sort`, which opens up the ability to sort descending as well as sort items that aren't naturally orderable.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\nOld:\r\n```\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"array_sort(a, (x, y) -> cardinality(x) - cardinality(y))\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n```\r\ndf.select(array_sort(col(\"a\"), (x, y) => size(x) - size(y)));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests updated to validate that the overload matches the expression's behavior.","created_at":"2022-08-01T12:58:51Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T09:21:37Z","closed_at":"2022-08-21T09:21:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1294023145b77586ec76872120e73035b738de1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/72d799b7560dcd4926ac8631654c7208b4cc62ac","head":{"label":"brandondahler:features/ArraySortOverload","ref":"features/ArraySortOverload","sha":"72d799b7560dcd4926ac8631654c7208b4cc62ac","user":{"login":"brandondahler","id":1155895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTU4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1155895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler","html_url":"https://github.com/brandondahler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":376837789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzY4Mzc3ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"brandondahler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brandondahler","id":1155895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTU4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1155895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler","html_url":"https://github.com/brandondahler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandondahler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brandondahler/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nGiven a batch size to `applyInPandas`, multiple groups are sent to Python UDF at once if they are very small. This improves performance of `applyInPandas` for very small groups.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark sends individual groups to Python. When groups are very small, only few rows are sent and processed with each call into Python, which degrades throughput. See SPARK-39931 for a benchmark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdds optional batchSize argument to `applyInPandas`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPython

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFrom this pr:https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22112, we learn that currently we can't rollback and rerun a result stage, and just fail.\r\n\r\nAnd this new pr is designed to solve some scenarios of this problem. When the analysis result from the result stage of a job will be output to a storage system, it can be written to a file system or database system.\r\n\r\n1. If the result was written to a file system, it was stored in a temporary directory until the result stage run successfully. If the result stage whose map stage is  indeterminate failed but had committed output for some partitions, we can delete these temporary files and roll back the result stage.\r\n2. If the result was written to a database system,  it will be written directly to the database and therefore if the result stage whose map stage is  indeterminate failed but some result tasks were successful, the result has been written successfully can not be rolled back\r\n3. Therefore, the main purpose of this new pr is to support Result Stage rollback in the scenarios of writing to any file system.\r\n4. I added a new identifier `isResultStageRetryAllowed` in RDD class to indicate whether its corresponding Result stage supports retries. \r\nIt is a Boolean variable and the default value is false，indicating that result stage rollback is not supported  and corresponds to the scenario of writing to the database.\r\nAnd in the case of writing to the file system, the result stage supports retries, and `isResultStageRetryAllowed` will be changed to true.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew tests and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ticket intends to add query hints for cache behaviors, users can perform actions like the use/skip/cache/uncache, etc on the cached results by the following hints.\r\n\r\n \r\n- RESULT_CACHE: spark will use cache by default, this hint keeps this behavior but will cache the child plan if uncached yet.\r\n\r\n- NO_RESULT_CACHE:with this hint, we can skip the default behavior to bypass the cached data if it is cached\r\n\r\n- RESULT_UNCACHE: with this hint, we can remove the cached data.\r\n\r\nRESULT_CACHE and NO_RESULT_CACHE are borrowed from oracle, FYI,[https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TGDBA/tune_result_cache.htm#TGDBA647.](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TGDBA/tune_result_cache.htm#TGDBA647), while RESULT_UNCACHE's added accordingly via the naming rule.\r\nSimilar ideas can also be found in MySQL, FYI https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/query-cache-in-select.html\r\n\r\nMaybe we can add more cache hints like RESULT_RECACHE to refresh the cached data, or maybe some cache behaviors that relate to metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs a supplement for CACHE/UNCACHE commands, pure SQL users can operate the cache in their queries directly without extra definitions. Also, cache skipping is supported by hints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, this PR brings some new hints\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- new tests for ut\r\n\r\n- test dist by hand\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1670\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`Utils.getIteratorSize` is slightly slower than `Iterator.size` when using Scala 2.13,  but it seems that we can't call `Iterator.size` directly, because `Utils.getIteratorSize` method returns `Long` type data, using `Iterator.size` directly can't ensure that overflow will not occur. \r\n\r\nSo this pr adds `if (iterator.knownSize > 0)` conditional branches to optimize this method when using Scala 2.13,  this optimization way refers to

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nfix `BinaryFileFormat` filter push down bug.\r\n\r\nBefore modification, when Filter tree is:\r\n````\r\n-Not\r\n- - IsNotNull\r\n````\r\n\r\nSince `IsNotNull` cannot be matched, `IsNotNull` will return a result that is always true (that is, `case _ => (_ => true)`), that is, no filter pushdown is performed. But because there is still a `Not`, after negation, it will return a result that is always False, that is, no result can be returned.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord
