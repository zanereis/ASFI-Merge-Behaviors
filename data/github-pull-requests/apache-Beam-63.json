(DNP) get its watermark by reading the low watermark across all the partitions being streamed. DNP can only update its watermark when ALL the partitions exists. If a partition is missing (due to splits/merges), and we advance DNP's watermark, we may be advancing further than the real low watermark is. The split/merged partition retains the same watermark as the parent, which could be lower than DNP's watermark and we cannot set the watermark backwards.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/25523\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is the first patch of migrating Flink runner batch job execution from DataSet to DataStream API. \r\n\r\nThe patch does the following:\r\n1. Add two FLIP-27 source implementations: `FlinkBoundedSource`, `FlinkUnboundedSource`. ImpulseSource was implemented as a built-in type of FlinkBoundedSource.\r\n2. Introduce necessary compatibility bridging classes to make the code work for Flink version [1.12, 1.15].\r\n\r\n`CHANGES.md` was not modified with this patch because this patch does not change the existing execution paths. The followup patches will update `CHANGES.md`.\r\n\r\nOne notable difference between FLIP-27 Source implementations and the existing `UnboundedSourceWrapper` class is that the new FLIP-27 source does not support accumulators yet. So the beam metrics from the `MetricsContainer` will not be reported. However, the FLIP-27 based sources will emit their own metrics.\r\n\r\nfixes #25486 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

raise an\n<code>AttributeError</code> when accessing an attribute that matches the name of an\nassertion but without the prefix <code>assert_</code>, e.g. accessing\n<code>called_once</code> instead of <code>assert_called_once</code>. This is in addition to\nthis already happening for accessing attributes with prefixes <code>assert</code>,\n<code>assret</code>, <code>asert</code>, <code>aseert</code>, and <code>assrt</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testing-cabal/mock/issues/96127\">gh-96127</a>: <code>inspect.signature</code> was raising <code>TypeError</code> on call with\nmock objects.

As a\nresult, an already-mocked object cannot have an attribute mocked using\n<code>autospec=True</code> or be the subject of a <code>create_autospec(...)</code> call. This\ncan uncover bugs in tests since these Mock-derived Mocks will always pass\ncertain tests (e.g. isinstance) and builtin assert functions (e.g.\nassert_called_once_with) will unconditionally pass.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bpo-45156: Fixes infinite loop on :func:<code>unittest.mock.seal</code> of mocks\ncreated by :func:<code>~unittest.create_autospec</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bpo-41403: Make :meth:<code>mock.patch</code> raise a :exc:<code>TypeError</code> with a\nrelevant error message on invalid arg.

URL rules using path converters will redirect with strict slashes when\nthe trailing slash is missing. :issue:<code>2533</code></li>\n<li>Type signature for <code>get_json</code> specifies that return type is not optional when\n<code>silent=False</code>. :issue:<code>2508</code></li>\n<li><code>parse_content_range_header</code> returns <code>None</code> for a value like <code>bytes */-1</code>\nwhere the length is invalid, instead of raising an <code>AssertionError</code>. :issue:<code>2531</code></li>\n<li>Address remaining <code>ResourceWarning</code> related to the socket used by <code>run_simple</code>.\nRemove <code>prepare_socket</code>, which now happens when creating the server. :issue:<code>2421</code></li>\n<li>Update pre-existing headers for <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests with the test\nclient. :issue:<code>2549</code></li>\n<li>Fix handling of header extended parameters such that they are no longer quoted.\n:issue:<code>2529</code></li>\n<li><code>LimitedStream.read</code> works correctly when wrapping a stream that may not return\nthe requested size in one <code>read</code> call. :issue:<code>2558</code></li>\n<li>A cookie header that starts with <code>=</code> is treated as an empty key and discarded,\nrather than stripping the leading <code>==</code>.</li>\n<li>Specify a maximum number of multipart parts, default 1000, after which a\n<code>RequestEntityTooLarge</code> exception is raised on parsing. This mitigates a DoS\nattack where a larger number of form/file parts would result in disproportionate\nresource use.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/22a254fca2ad0130adbbcbd11d3de51bcb04a08b\"><code>22a254f</code></a> release version 2.2.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1\"><code>517cac5</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/babc8d9e8c9fa995ef26050698bc9b5a92803664\"><code>babc8d9</code></a> rewrite docs about request data limits</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/09449ee77934a0c883f5959785864ecae6aaa2c9\"><code>09449ee</code></a> clean up docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/fe899d0cdf767a7289a8bf746b7f72c2907a1b4b\"><code>fe899d0</code></a> limit the maximum number of multipart form parts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/cf275f42acad1b5950c50ffe8ef58fe62cdce028\"><code>cf275f4</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/8c2b4b82d0cade0d37e6a88e2cd2413878e8ebd4\"><code>8c2b4b8</code></a> don't strip leading = when parsing cookie</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/7c7ce5cb73f3f7d3b9c09340e4f322aeb583dbc5\"><code>7c7ce5c</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pallets/werkzeug/issues/2585\">#2585</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/19ae03e6a39b3f63fd08fef4fddae4385cdddf25\"><code>19ae03e</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] auto fixes from pre-commit.com hooks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/a83d3b8bf070810874c8e8d03dcce270666e10fe\"><code>a83d3b8</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/compare/2.2.2...2.2.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=werkzeug&package-manager=pip&previous-version=2.2.2&new-version=2.2.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

URL rules using path converters will redirect with strict slashes when\nthe trailing slash is missing. :issue:<code>2533</code></li>\n<li>Type signature for <code>get_json</code> specifies that return type is not optional when\n<code>silent=False</code>. :issue:<code>2508</code></li>\n<li><code>parse_content_range_header</code> returns <code>None</code> for a value like <code>bytes */-1</code>\nwhere the length is invalid, instead of raising an <code>AssertionError</code>. :issue:<code>2531</code></li>\n<li>Address remaining <code>ResourceWarning</code> related to the socket used by <code>run_simple</code>.\nRemove <code>prepare_socket</code>, which now happens when creating the server. :issue:<code>2421</code></li>\n<li>Update pre-existing headers for <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests with the test\nclient. :issue:<code>2549</code></li>\n<li>Fix handling of header extended parameters such that they are no longer quoted.\n:issue:<code>2529</code></li>\n<li><code>LimitedStream.read</code> works correctly when wrapping a stream that may not return\nthe requested size in one <code>read</code> call. :issue:<code>2558</code></li>\n<li>A cookie header that starts with <code>=</code> is treated as an empty key and discarded,\nrather than stripping the leading <code>==</code>.</li>\n<li>Specify a maximum number of multipart parts, default 1000, after which a\n<code>RequestEntityTooLarge</code> exception is raised on parsing. This mitigates a DoS\nattack where a larger number of form/file parts would result in disproportionate\nresource use.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/22a254fca2ad0130adbbcbd11d3de51bcb04a08b\"><code>22a254f</code></a> release version 2.2.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1\"><code>517cac5</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/babc8d9e8c9fa995ef26050698bc9b5a92803664\"><code>babc8d9</code></a> rewrite docs about request data limits</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/09449ee77934a0c883f5959785864ecae6aaa2c9\"><code>09449ee</code></a> clean up docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/fe899d0cdf767a7289a8bf746b7f72c2907a1b4b\"><code>fe899d0</code></a> limit the maximum number of multipart form parts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/cf275f42acad1b5950c50ffe8ef58fe62cdce028\"><code>cf275f4</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/8c2b4b82d0cade0d37e6a88e2cd2413878e8ebd4\"><code>8c2b4b8</code></a> don't strip leading = when parsing cookie</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/7c7ce5cb73f3f7d3b9c09340e4f322aeb583dbc5\"><code>7c7ce5c</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pallets/werkzeug/issues/2585\">#2585</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/19ae03e6a39b3f63fd08fef4fddae4385cdddf25\"><code>19ae03e</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] auto fixes from pre-commit.com hooks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/a83d3b8bf070810874c8e8d03dcce270666e10fe\"><code>a83d3b8</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/compare/2.2.2...2.2.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=werkzeug&package-manager=pip&previous-version=2.2.2&new-version=2.2.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

URL rules using path converters will redirect with strict slashes when\nthe trailing slash is missing. :issue:<code>2533</code></li>\n<li>Type signature for <code>get_json</code> specifies that return type is not optional when\n<code>silent=False</code>. :issue:<code>2508</code></li>\n<li><code>parse_content_range_header</code> returns <code>None</code> for a value like <code>bytes */-1</code>\nwhere the length is invalid, instead of raising an <code>AssertionError</code>. :issue:<code>2531</code></li>\n<li>Address remaining <code>ResourceWarning</code> related to the socket used by <code>run_simple</code>.\nRemove <code>prepare_socket</code>, which now happens when creating the server. :issue:<code>2421</code></li>\n<li>Update pre-existing headers for <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests with the test\nclient. :issue:<code>2549</code></li>\n<li>Fix handling of header extended parameters such that they are no longer quoted.\n:issue:<code>2529</code></li>\n<li><code>LimitedStream.read</code> works correctly when wrapping a stream that may not return\nthe requested size in one <code>read</code> call. :issue:<code>2558</code></li>\n<li>A cookie header that starts with <code>=</code> is treated as an empty key and discarded,\nrather than stripping the leading <code>==</code>.</li>\n<li>Specify a maximum number of multipart parts, default 1000, after which a\n<code>RequestEntityTooLarge</code> exception is raised on parsing. This mitigates a DoS\nattack where a larger number of form/file parts would result in disproportionate\nresource use.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/22a254fca2ad0130adbbcbd11d3de51bcb04a08b\"><code>22a254f</code></a> release version 2.2.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1\"><code>517cac5</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/babc8d9e8c9fa995ef26050698bc9b5a92803664\"><code>babc8d9</code></a> rewrite docs about request data limits</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/09449ee77934a0c883f5959785864ecae6aaa2c9\"><code>09449ee</code></a> clean up docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/fe899d0cdf767a7289a8bf746b7f72c2907a1b4b\"><code>fe899d0</code></a> limit the maximum number of multipart form parts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/cf275f42acad1b5950c50ffe8ef58fe62cdce028\"><code>cf275f4</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/8c2b4b82d0cade0d37e6a88e2cd2413878e8ebd4\"><code>8c2b4b8</code></a> don't strip leading = when parsing cookie</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/7c7ce5cb73f3f7d3b9c09340e4f322aeb583dbc5\"><code>7c7ce5c</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pallets/werkzeug/issues/2585\">#2585</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/19ae03e6a39b3f63fd08fef4fddae4385cdddf25\"><code>19ae03e</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] auto fixes from pre-commit.com hooks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/a83d3b8bf070810874c8e8d03dcce270666e10fe\"><code>a83d3b8</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/compare/2.2.2...2.2.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=werkzeug&package-manager=pip&previous-version=2.2.2&new-version=2.2.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

URL rules using path converters will redirect with strict slashes when\nthe trailing slash is missing. :issue:<code>2533</code></li>\n<li>Type signature for <code>get_json</code> specifies that return type is not optional when\n<code>silent=False</code>. :issue:<code>2508</code></li>\n<li><code>parse_content_range_header</code> returns <code>None</code> for a value like <code>bytes */-1</code>\nwhere the length is invalid, instead of raising an <code>AssertionError</code>. :issue:<code>2531</code></li>\n<li>Address remaining <code>ResourceWarning</code> related to the socket used by <code>run_simple</code>.\nRemove <code>prepare_socket</code>, which now happens when creating the server. :issue:<code>2421</code></li>\n<li>Update pre-existing headers for <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests with the test\nclient. :issue:<code>2549</code></li>\n<li>Fix handling of header extended parameters such that they are no longer quoted.\n:issue:<code>2529</code></li>\n<li><code>LimitedStream.read</code> works correctly when wrapping a stream that may not return\nthe requested size in one <code>read</code> call. :issue:<code>2558</code></li>\n<li>A cookie header that starts with <code>=</code> is treated as an empty key and discarded,\nrather than stripping the leading <code>==</code>.</li>\n<li>Specify a maximum number of multipart parts, default 1000, after which a\n<code>RequestEntityTooLarge</code> exception is raised on parsing. This mitigates a DoS\nattack where a larger number of form/file parts would result in disproportionate\nresource use.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/22a254fca2ad0130adbbcbd11d3de51bcb04a08b\"><code>22a254f</code></a> release version 2.2.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1\"><code>517cac5</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/babc8d9e8c9fa995ef26050698bc9b5a92803664\"><code>babc8d9</code></a> rewrite docs about request data limits</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/09449ee77934a0c883f5959785864ecae6aaa2c9\"><code>09449ee</code></a> clean up docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/fe899d0cdf767a7289a8bf746b7f72c2907a1b4b\"><code>fe899d0</code></a> limit the maximum number of multipart form parts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/cf275f42acad1b5950c50ffe8ef58fe62cdce028\"><code>cf275f4</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/8c2b4b82d0cade0d37e6a88e2cd2413878e8ebd4\"><code>8c2b4b8</code></a> don't strip leading = when parsing cookie</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/7c7ce5cb73f3f7d3b9c09340e4f322aeb583dbc5\"><code>7c7ce5c</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pallets/werkzeug/issues/2585\">#2585</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/19ae03e6a39b3f63fd08fef4fddae4385cdddf25\"><code>19ae03e</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] auto fixes from pre-commit.com hooks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/a83d3b8bf070810874c8e8d03dcce270666e10fe\"><code>a83d3b8</code></a> [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/compare/2.2.2...2.2.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=werkzeug&package-manager=pip&previous-version=2.2.2&new-version=2.2.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\ncc: @aromanenko-dev @mosche \r\n\r\nfixes: #23570\r\n\r\nI've implemented the Java part and have some questions wanna clear before adding the Python part:\r\n\r\nJava Questions:\r\n- do I need to add the expand service gradle config: https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/io/kinesis/expansion-service?\r\n- What would be the proper input type to `KinesisIO.Write`? I'm not sure how Python type translate to x-lang transforms.. I hard-coded it to `byte[]` for now.\r\n- Why does `KinesisIO` implements its own `KinesisIO.Write.Result` instead of using the provided `PDone`? They looks the same in terms of implementation.\r\n- Testing: is adding tests to [xlang_kinesisio_it_test.py](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/external/xlang_kinesisio_it_test.py) after changes on the python part the correct approach?\r\n\r\nPython questions:\r\n- Because some fields are removed (i.e. `partition_key`, `verify_certificate`), and mechanisms are changes (i.e. partitioning). What's the general policy for beam to introduce breaking changes? Do we just break it at the code-level and release it with major version? Or do we introduce a v2 version and deprecate the old one to allow gradual transition.  \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
