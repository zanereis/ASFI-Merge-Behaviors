the implementation does one unnecessary aggregation step. The aggregation step for level L (to choose splits) gives enough information to set the predictions of any leaf nodes at level L+1. We can use that info and skip the aggregation step for the last level of the tree (which only has leaf nodes).\n### Implementation Details\n\nEach node now has a `impurity` field and the `predict` is changed from type `Double` to type `Predict`(this can be used to compute predict probability in the future) When compute best splits for each node, we also compute impurity and predict for the child nodes, which is used to constructed newly allocated child nodes. So at level L, we have set impurity and predict for nodes at level L +1.\nIf level L+1 is the last level, then we can avoid aggregation. What's more, calculation of parent impurity in \n\nTop nodes for each tree needs to be treated differently because we have to compute impurity and predict for them first. In `binsToBestSplit`, if current node is top node(level == 0), we calculate impurity and predict first. \nafter finding best split, top node's predict and impurity is set to the calculated value. Non-top nodes's impurity and predict are already calculated and don't need to be recalculated again. I have considered to add a initialization step to set top nodes' impurity and predict and then we can treat all nodes in the same way, but this will need a lot of duplication of code(all the code to do seq operation(BinSeqOp) needs to be duplicated), so I choose the current way.\n\n CC @mengxr @manishamde @jkbradley, please help me review this, thanks.\n","created_at":"2014-10-08T08:16:56Z","updated_at":"2014-10-09T08:41:19Z","closed_at":"2014-10-09T08:41:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4959e0ffc977c1bc0875e9dea544003c4034f5ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2708/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2708/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2708/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e269ea2902ed8cd6dc1ae30938544009be1e374","head":{"label":"chouqin:avoid-agg","ref":"avoid-agg","sha":"8e269ea2902ed8cd6dc1ae30938544009be1e374","user":{"login":"chouqin","id":1285855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODU4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1285855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin","html_url":"https://github.com/chouqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23419055,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzQxOTA1NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"chouqin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chouqin","id":1285855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODU4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1285855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin","html_url":"https://github.com/chouqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chouqin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chouqin/spark","description":"Mirror

is a generic algorithm for matrix factorization which is equally applicable for both feature space and similarity space. Current ALS support L2 regularization and positivity constraint. This PR introduces userConstraint and productConstraint to ALS and let's the user select different constraints for user and product solves. The supported constraints are the following:\n1. SMOOTH : default ALS with L2 regularization\n2. POSITIVE: ALS with positive factors\n3. BOUNDS: ALS with factors bounded within upper and lower bound (default within 0 and 1)\n4. SPARSE: ALS with L1 regularization\n5. EQUALITY: ALS with equality constraint (default the factors sum up to 1 and positive)\n\nFirst let's focus on the problem formulation. Both implicit and explicit feedback ALS formulation can be written as a quadratic minimization problem. The quadratic objective can be written as xtHx + ctx. Each of the respective constraints take the following form:\nminimize xtHx + ctx\ns.t ||x||1 <= c (SPARSE constraint)\n\nWe rewrite the objective as f(x) = xtHx + ctx and the constraint as an indicator function g(x)\n\nNow minimization of f(x) + g(x) can be carried out using various forward backward splitting algorithms. We choose ADMM for the first version based on our experimentation with ECOS IP solver and MOSEK comparisons. I will document the comparisons.\n\nDetails of the algorithm are in the following reference:\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/admm_distr_stats.pdf\n\nRight now the default parameters of alpha, rho are set as 1.0 but the following issues show up in experiments with MovieLens dataset:\n1. ~3X higher iterations as compared to NNLS\n2. For SPARSE we are hitting the max iterations (400) around 10% of the time\n3. For EQUALITY rho is set at 50 based on a reference from Professor Boyd on optimal control\n\nWe choose ADMM as the baseline solver but this PR will explore the following solver enhancements to decrease the iteration count:\n1. Accelerated ADMM using Nesterov acceleration\n2. FISTA style forward backward splitting\n\nFor use-cases the PR is focused on the following:\n1. Sparse matrix factorization to improve recommendation \n   On Movielens data right now the RMSE with SPARSE is 10% (1.04) lower than the Mahout/Spark baseline (0.9) but have not looked into map, prec@k and ndcg@k measures. Using the PR from @coderxiang to look into IR measures.\n   Example run:\n   MASTER=spark://localhost:7077 ./bin/run-example mllib.MovieLensALS --rank 20 --numIterations 10 --userConstraint SMOOTH --lambdaUser 0.065 --productConstraint SPARSE --lambdaProduct 0.1 --kryo hdfs://localhost:8020/sandbox/movielens/\n2. Topic modeling using LSA\n   References:\n   2007 Sparse coding: papers.nips.cc/paper/2979-efficient-sparse-coding-algorithms.pdf\n   2011 Sparse Latent Semantic Analysis LSA(some of it is implemented in Graphlab): \n   https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xichen/images/SLSA-sdm11-final.pdf\n   2012 Sparse Coding + MR/MPI Microsoft: http://web.stanford.edu/group/mmds/slides2012/s-hli.pdf\n   Implementing the 20NG flow to validate the sparse coding result improvement over LDA based topic modeling.\n3. Topic modeling using PLSA\n   Reference: \n   Tutorial on Probabilistic Topic Modeling: Additive Regularization for Stochastic Matrix Factorization\n   The EQUALITY formulation with a Quadratic loss is an approximation to the KL divergence loss being used in PLSA. We are interested to see if it improves the result further as compared to the Sparse coding.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Improve the convergence rate of forward-backward splitting on quadratic problems\n2. Move the test-cases to QuadraticMinimizerSuite.scala\n3. Generate results for each of the use-cases and add tests related to each use-case\n\nRelated future PRs:\n1. Scale the factorization rank and remove the need to construct H matrix\n2. Replace the quadratic loss xtHx + ctx with a Convex loss\n","created_at":"2014-10-08T03:49:55Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T08:07:19Z","closed_at":"2014-11-12T08:07:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1e7e36e9158f5fcdf576ce87577fea05d11ea216","head":{"label":"debasish83:qp-als","ref":"qp-als","sha":"1e7e36e9158f5fcdf576ce87577fea05d11ea216","user":{"login":"debasish83","id":510896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/510896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83","html_url":"https://github.com/debasish83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17971510,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzk3MTUxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"debasish83/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"debasish83","id":510896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/510896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83","html_url":"https://github.com/debasish83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/debasish83/spark","description":"Mirror

PR is a follow up of #2590, and tries to introduce a top level SQL parser entry point for all SQL dialects supported by Spark SQL.\n\nA top level parser `SparkSQLParser` is introduced to handle the syntaxes that all SQL dialects should recognize (e.g. `CACHE TABLE`, `UNCACHE TABLE` and `SET`, etc.). For all the syntaxes this parser doesn't recognize directly, it fallbacks to a specified function that tries to parse arbitrary input to a `LogicalPlan`. This function is typically another parser combinator like `SqlParser`. DDL syntaxes introduced in #2475 can be moved to here.\n\nThe `ExtendedHiveQlParser` now only handle Hive specific extensions.\n\nAlso took the chance to refactor/reformat `SqlParser` for better readability.\n","created_at":"2014-10-07T23:10:22Z","updated_at":"2014-10-10T03:22:39Z","closed_at":"2014-10-10T01:26:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c17b3cfa340f9f5acb6de0ccfdc6d5d1de55cadf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ceada769af4d2b9d2df7f0bf9013a3ef7a3cb196","head":{"label":"liancheng:gen-sql-parser","ref":"gen-sql-parser","sha":"ceada769af4d2b9d2df7f0bf9013a3ef7a3cb196","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

pull request is a first step towards the implementation of a stable, pull-based progress / status API for Spark (see [SPARK-2321](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2321)).  For now, I'd like to discuss the basic implementation, API names, and overall interface design.  Once we arrive at a good design, I'll go back and add additional methods to expose more information via these API.\n#### Design goals:\n- Pull-based API\n- Usable from Java / Scala / Python (eventually, likely with a wrapper)\n- Can be extended to expose more information without introducing binary incompatibilities.\n- Returns immutable objects.\n- Don't leak any implementation details, preserving our freedom to change the implementation.\n#### Implementation:\n- Add public methods (`getJobInfo`, `getStageInfo`) to SparkContext to allow status / progress information to be retrieved.\n- Add public interfaces (`SparkJobInfo`, `SparkStageInfo`) for our API return values.  These interfaces consist entirely of Java-style getter methods.  The interfaces are currently implemented in Java.  I decided to explicitly separate the interface from its implementation (`SparkJobInfoImpl`, `SparkStageInfoImpl`) in order to prevent users from constructing these responses themselves.\n  -Allow an existing JobProgressListener to be used when constructing a live SparkUI.  This allows us to re-use this listeners in the implementation of this status API.  There are a few reasons why this listener re-use makes sense:\n  - The status API and web UI are guaranteed to show consistent information.\n  - These listeners are already well-tested.\n  - The same garbage-collection / information retention configurations can apply to both this API and the web UI.\n- Extend JobProgressListener to maintain `jobId -> Job` and `stageId -> Stage` mappings.\n\nThe progress API methods are implemented in a separate trait that's mixed into SparkContext.  This helps to avoid SparkContext.scala from becoming larger and more difficult to read.\n","created_at":"2014-10-07T21:48:43Z","updated_at":"2014-10-25T07:09:24Z","closed_at":"2014-10-25T07:09:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb72cb35c3937025b6a27d6ccc38d5898d03f976","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2696/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2696/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2696/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6aa78d16314c66903aa7d1d2c52e5237a9a9d0d","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:progress-reporting-api","ref":"progress-reporting-api","sha":"e6aa78d16314c66903aa7d1d2c52e5237a9a9d0d","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

simplified\n","created_at":"2014-10-07T12:41:45Z","updated_at":"2015-04-11T05:21:15Z","closed_at":"2014-10-09T00:04:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"41dcb59af1a594cbb53dd37040d32b8eb26ebc1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/25f3e20446dfb5f14cc0592b3efb54c3160bed93","head":{"label":"sarutak:SPARK-3831","ref":"SPARK-3831","sha":"25f3e20446dfb5f14cc0592b3efb54c3160bed93","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

patch attempts to fix SPARK-2546 in `branch-1.0` and `branch-1.1`.  The underlying problem is that thread-safety issues in Hadoop Configuration objects may cause Spark tasks to get stuck in infinite loops.  The approach taken here is to clone a new copy of the JobConf for each task rather than sharing a single copy between tasks.  Note that there are still Configuration thread-safety issues that may affect the driver, but these seem much less likely to occur in practice and will be more complex to fix (see discussion on the SPARK-2546 ticket).\n\nThis cloning is guarded by a new configuration option (`spark.hadoop.cloneConf`) and is disabled by default in order to avoid unexpected performance regressions for workloads that are unaffected by the Configuration thread-safety issues.\n","created_at":"2014-10-06T23:33:37Z","updated_at":"2014-10-19T07:37:39Z","closed_at":"2014-10-19T07:37:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5203315868ce8a18940dfa940e2e7782ba68569d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f14f25981f1b922f1a8d07dfd80774a78daec368","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:jobconf-fix-backport","ref":"jobconf-fix-backport","sha":"f14f25981f1b922f1a8d07dfd80774a78daec368","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

most of tasks, the serialized data will small, such as less than 8k, we can avoid the RPC at all if the data was embedded in the Broadcast object it self.\n\nWith this patch, The size of task will be similar to that before we use broadcast for them, no RPC (but still cached, only one deserialization per executor)\n\nIt will increase the bandwidth during schedule tasks, for example, if we schedule 10k tasks per seconds, then it will need 40M Bytes more bandwidth for the embedded object in the worst cases.

PR aims to provide a way to skip/query corrupt JSON records. To do so, we introduce an internal column to hold corrupt records (the default name is `_corrupt_record`. This name can be changed by setting the value of `spark.sql.columnNameOfCorruptRecord`). When there is a parsing error, we will put the corrupt record in its unparsed format to the internal column. Users can skip/query this column through SQL.\n- To query those corrupt records\n\n```\n-- For Hive parser\nSELECT `_corrupt_record`\nFROM jsonTable\nWHERE `_corrupt_record` IS NOT NULL\n-- For our SQL parser\nSELECT _corrupt_record\nFROM jsonTable\nWHERE _corrupt_record IS NOT NULL\n```\n- To skip corrupt records and query regular records\n\n```\n-- For Hive parser\nSELECT field1, field2\nFROM jsonTable\nWHERE `_corrupt_record` IS NULL\n-- For our SQL parser\nSELECT field1, field2\nFROM jsonTable\nWHERE _corrupt_record IS NULL\n```\n\nGenerally, it is not recommended to change the name of the internal column. If the name has to be changed to avoid possible name conflicts, you can use `sqlContext.setConf(SQLConf.COLUMN_NAME_OF_CORRUPT_RECORD, <new column name>)` or `sqlContext.sql(SET spark.sql.columnNameOfCorruptRecord=<new column name>)`.\n","created_at":"2014-10-06T17:53:32Z","updated_at":"2014-10-10T13:05:40Z","closed_at":"2014-10-09T21:58:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d6135b0cd1c3386ef4d8220fc7ed27d64bf1b70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c9828ec1a32363ce3426463845431f216add972","head":{"label":"yhuai:corruptJsonRecord","ref":"corruptJsonRecord","sha":"4c9828ec1a32363ce3426463845431f216add972","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"00b7791720e50119a98084b2e8755e1b593ca55f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

@scwf pointed out, `HiveThriftServer2Suite` isn't effective anymore after the Thrift server was made a daemon. On the other hand, these test suites were known flaky, PR #2214 tried to fix them but failed because of unknown Jenkins build error. This PR fixes both sets of issues.\n\nIn this PR, instead of watching `start-thriftserver.sh` output, the test code start a `tail` process to watch the log file. A `Thread.sleep` has to be introduced because the `kill` command used in `stop-thriftserver.sh` is not synchronous.\n\nAs for the root cause of the mysterious Jenkins build failure. Please refer to [this comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2675#issuecomment-58464189) below for details.\n\n---\n\n(Copied from PR description of #2214)\n\nThis PR fixes two issues of `HiveThriftServer2Suite` and brings 1 enhancement:\n1. Although metastore, warehouse directories and listening port are randomly chosen, all test cases share the same configuration. Due to parallel test execution, one of the two test case is doomed to fail\n2. We caught any exceptions thrown from a test case and print diagnosis information, but forgot to re-throw the exception...\n3. When the forked server process ends prematurely (e.g., fails to start), the `serverRunning` promise is completed with a failure, preventing the test code to keep waiting until timeout.\n\nSo, embarrassingly, this test suite was failing continuously for several days but no one had ever noticed it... Fortunately no bugs in the production code were covered under the hood.\n","created_at":"2014-10-06T14:22:23Z","updated_at":"2014-10-14T00:54:26Z","closed_at":"2014-10-13T20:52:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a751c270b3ce6f474afa47aa222eabe4687e0b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2675/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2675/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2675/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c384b7bc8b0b8d5b9b6bf294f399de5bb8a9976","head":{"label":"liancheng:fix-thriftserver-tests","ref":"fix-thriftserver-tests","sha":"1c384b7bc8b0b8d5b9b6bf294f399de5bb8a9976","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

noticed a few issues with how temp directories are created and deleted:\n\n_Minor_\n- Guava's `Files.createTempDir()` plus `File.deleteOnExit()` is used in many tests to make a temp dir, but `Utils.createTempDir()` seems to be the standard Spark mechanism\n- Call to `File.deleteOnExit()` could be pushed into `Utils.createTempDir()` as well, along with this replacement\n- _I messed up the message in an exception in `Utils` in SPARK-3794; fixed here_\n\n_Bit Less Minor_\n- `Utils.deleteRecursively()` fails immediately if any `IOException` occurs, instead of trying to delete any remaining files and subdirectories. I've observed this leave temp dirs around. I suggest changing it to continue in the face of an exception and throw one of the possibly several exceptions that occur at the end.\n- `Utils.createTempDir()` will add a JVM shutdown hook every time the method is called. Even if the subdir is the parent of another parent dir, since this check is inside the hook. However `Utils` manages a set of all dirs to delete on shutdown already, called `shutdownDeletePaths`. A single hook can be registered to delete all of these on exit. This is how Tachyon temp paths are cleaned up in `TachyonBlockManager`.\n\nI noticed a few other things that might be changed but wanted to ask first:\n- Shouldn't the set of dirs to delete be `File`, not just `String` paths?\n- `Utils` manages the set of `TachyonFile` that have been registered for deletion, but the shutdown hook is managed in `TachyonBlockManager`. Should this logic not live together, and not in `Utils`? it's more specific to Tachyon, and looks a slight bit odd to import in such a generic place.\n","created_at":"2014-10-06T10:22:00Z","updated_at":"2014-10-12T15:59:23Z","closed_at":"2014-10-10T01:23:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67f7066c7dafba0c6b9378602812a27c4606def3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/071ae6050a5ea1c70b504afdfcf91acb7d73ad19","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-3811","ref":"SPARK-3811","sha":"071ae6050a5ea1c70b504afdfcf91acb7d73ad19","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

is a follow up of #2226 and #2616 to fix Jenkins master SBT build failures for lower Hadoop versions (1.0.x and 2.0.x).\n\nThe root cause is the semantics difference of `FileSystem.globStatus()` between different versions of Hadoop, as illustrated by the following test code:\n\n``` scala\nobject GlobExperiments extends App {\n  val conf = new Configuration()\n  val fs = FileSystem.getLocal(conf)\n  fs.globStatus(new Path(\"/tmp/wh/*/*/*\")).foreach { status =>\n    println(status.getPath)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTarget directory structure:\n\n```\n/tmp/wh\n├── dir0\n│   ├── dir1\n│   │   └── level2\n│   └── level1\n└── level0\n```\n\nHadoop 2.4.1 result:\n\n```\nfile:/tmp/wh/dir0/dir1/level2\n```\n\nHadoop 1.0.4 result:\n\n```\nfile:/tmp/wh/dir0/dir1/level2\nfile:/tmp/wh/dir0/level1\nfile:/tmp/wh/level0\n```\n\nIn #2226 and #2616, we call `FileOutputCommitter.commitJob()` at the end of the job, and the `_SUCCESS` mark file is written. When working with lower Hadoop versions, due to the `globStatus()` semantics issue, `_SUCCESS` is included as a separate partition data file by `Hive.loadDynamicPartitions()`, and fails partition spec checking.  The fix introduced in this PR is kind of a hack: when inserting data with dynamic partitioning, we intentionally avoid writing the `_SUCCESS` marker to workaround this issue.\n\nHive doesn't suffer this issue because `FileSinkOperator` doesn't call `FileOutputCommitter.commitJob()`, instead, it calls `Utilities.mvFileToFinalPath()` to cleanup the output directory and then loads it into Hive warehouse by with `loadDynamicPartitions()`/`loadPartition()`/`loadTable()`.

patch will bring support for broadcasting objects larger than 2G.\n\npickle, zlib, FrameSerializer and Array[Byte] all can not support objects larger than 2G, so this patch introduce LargeObjectSerializer to serialize broadcast objects, the object will be serialized and compressed into small chunks, it also change the type of Broadcast[Array[Byte]]] into Broadcast[Array[Array[Byte]]]].\n\nTesting for support broadcast objects larger than 2G is slow and memory hungry, so this is tested manually, could be added into

pull request addresses a few issues related to PySpark's IPython support:\n- Fix the remaining uses of the '-u' flag, which IPython doesn't support (see SPARK-3772).\n- Change PYSPARK_PYTHON_OPTS to PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS, so that the old name is reserved in case we ever want to allow the worker Python options to be customized (this variable was introduced in #2554 and hasn't landed in a release yet, so this doesn't break any compatibility).\n- Introduce a PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON option that allows the driver to use `ipython` while the workers use a different Python version.\n- Attempt to use Python 2.7 by default if PYSPARK_PYTHON is not specified.\n- Retain the old semantics for IPYTHON=1 and IPYTHON_OPTS (to avoid breaking existing example programs).\n\nThere are more details in a block comment in `bin/pyspark`.\n","created_at":"2014-10-04T01:57:54Z","updated_at":"2014-10-13T04:46:31Z","closed_at":"2014-10-09T23:09:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b36968be29a710749df4560f20132e0d2084c81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/2651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/2651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b8eb86c303a83d83f99e7cd18dab020a76e001b","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-3772","ref":"SPARK-3772","sha":"7b8eb86c303a83d83f99e7cd18dab020a76e001b","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

the comment (Line 1083), it says: \"Otherwise, interpolate the number of partitions we need to try, but overestimate it by 50%.\"\n\n`(1.5 * num * partsScanned / buf.size).toInt` is the guess of \"num of total partitions needed\". In every iteration, we should consider the increment `(1.5 * num * partsScanned / buf.size).toInt - partsScanned`\nExisting implementation 'exponentially' grows `partsScanned` ( roughly: `x_{n+1} >= (1.5 + 1) x_n`)\n\nThis could be a performance problem.

commit introduces a general distance function trait, `PointOps`, for the Spark K-Means clusterer. There are no public API changes*.  \n### Issue - Data Capture Test Fails - NEED HELP\n\nThe `org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.KMeansClusterSuite` \"task size should be small in both training and prediction\" fails, suggesting that the RDD data is being captured in a closure.  This is quite puzzling. My efforts to solve this problem have failed. I _need help_ to solve this problem. \n### Distance Function Trait\n\nThe `PointOps` trait defines the distance function.  The `PointOps` trait is more than a simple distance function.  It also defines the types of Points and Centers for the clusterer.  Standard MLLIB `Vector`s are converted into Points and Centers.  In the case of the `FastEuclideanOps` implementation of `PointOps`, the Point and Center types includes vector norm members. In other distance functions such as the [Kullback-Leibler distance function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bregman_divergence), the Point and Center types include different values that speed up the distance calculation in a similar way that caching vector norms speeds up the Euclidean distance function.  This addresses SPARK-3219.\n### Refactoring\n\nTo understand this original code, I found it useful to refactor the original implementation into components.  You may find it helpful to understand this pull request by looking at the new components and comparing them to their original implementation.  Unfortunately, GitHub diff does not help very much with this.\n\nThis commit splits up the clusterer into a number of components which behave (largely) like their predecessors. `KMeansParallel` implements the K-Means || initialization algorithm.  `KMeansRandom` implements the K-Means Random initialization algorithm.  `MultiKMeans` implements the K-Means algorithm on multiple sets of cluster centers using a given distance function.  Traits for the initializer, `KMeansInitializer`, and the general K-Means clusterer, `MultiKMeansClusterer`, are provided to highlight the salient interfaces with the intent that alternative implementations of these interfaces may be provided in the future.\n### Performance\n\nThis pull request is not focused on performance. Nevertheless,  the performance of the KMeans++ implementation was _dramatically_ improved by NOT recomputing distances to clusters centers that were present in previous steps.  This turns a quadratic implementation into a linear one. \n\nSecond, the KMeans++ implementation uses the general K-Means clusterer in the final step.  This parallelizes a step that was sequential.\n\nTogether, these changes address SPARK-3424.\n### Next Steps\n\nThis pull request does not introduce new user-visible changes.  The next step is to make different distance functions available through a user-visible API.   I will provide other distance functions after this pull request has been accepted. Then, we can decide on an appropriate user-level API to access those functions.\n### Compatibility\n\nWhile there are no user-level API changes, the behavior of the clusterer is _different_ on some tests.  Specifically, the handling of empty clusters has changed.  Empty clusters are not filled with random points in this implementation.  The former behavior is undesirable for a number a reasons, not the least of which is that there is no reasonable use for duplicate cluster centers. To accommodate the change in behavior, the test cases were changed accordingly. This addresses SPARK-3261.\n### Testing\n\nThis code has been tested (albeit while packaged outside of Spark) and performance measured on data sets of millions of features each with hundreds of dimensions and on tens of thousands of

Spark Streaming using Event TimeStamps\n\nSpark streaming creates a batch (RDD) of events every T duration. The batch is based on a schedule and the timestamp associated with the batch is the time at which it was scheduled by Spark. Spark applied timestamp may be less relevant than the timestamp for which the event was originally meant to be.\n\nThe fundamental reason for the event timestamp to differ from the spark stamp is the delay in event generation in the upstream system and delay in transporting the event to spark after the event generation. The problem is compounded in case of events having a start and an end with both the timestamps packed in a single event generated after the event ends as illustrated in the following diagram.\n\n(upstream) -------s--------e----g---------------->\n(spark   ) ------------------------r------------->\n\nHorizontal axis is time. Event starts at s ends at e and the event record is generated at g, which is then received by spark at r.\n\nSo there is a need to create batches which only contain the relevant events or the relevant proportion of the events according to the original timestamp passed to Spark as a part of the received tuples.  Lets refer to a batch which has all the events occurring in the time window it represents as a bin. So a bin from T1 - T2 will 'only have events' which occurred in the period T1 - T2. The definition of the bin can be extended to include ‘all the events’ which occurred in a given period, however second constraint is harder to satisfy in practice, because events can be arbitrarily delayed. \n\nFor the rest of the discussion the definition of the batch and the bin shall be as per the previous paragraph.\n\nBin sizes determine time series time granularity and is an independent consideration in itself i.e independent of the batch/event/delay.\n\nLets say that batch size is T and the bin size is n_T and an event is delayed (for reception) at a maximum by d_T. So in order to generate a bin, n + d batches of size T are required.\n\nConversely every batch is going to contribute to current up till the last ceiling((n + d)/ n) bins.\n\nFor for batch @ t. The contents can be seen as T1 @ t (where the notation T1 @ t implies events corresponding to bin T1 from batch t), T1 - 1 @t, T1 - 2 @t ... T1 - m @ t (where T1 - 1, represents the bin previous to T1 and m = ceiling(n + d)/ n))).\n\nWe can then de-multiplex the contributions from batch @ t into bins T1, T1 - 1, T1 - 2, T1 -3, resulting into streams which represent partial bins relative to the batch stream. So a stream i represents partial bin T1 - i received at t. This way the spark application can deliver incremental bins to the downstream in the most real time possible. Now depending on how the downstream application can handle the partial bins, the definition and the generation of the streams needs to be controlled.\n\nCases:\n1. The downstream application can handle incremental updates to the bin (i.e. a partial bin = current partial bin + latest partial bin). For this what is required is m streams  which send the updates every T interval where\n\nStream 1: T1 @ t\nStream 2: T1 - 1 @ t\n…\nStream m: T1 - m @ t.\n1. The downstream application can only handle full updates to the bin ( i.e. partial bin = latest partial bin). For this what is required is m streams  which send the updates every T interval where\n\nStream 1: T1         @ t\nStream 2: T1 - 1    @ t +  @ t - 1\n...\nStream m: T1 - m @ t +  … +  @ t - m \n\ni.e a bin is getting updated at every T until the bin is final. The first stream represents the most current bin with the latest cumulative update. The next stream represents the previous bin with the latest cumulative update and so on. Until the last stream which represents a final bin.\n1. The downstream application cannot handle updates to a bin. This is basically the last stream from case 2 (highlighted in bold) with the exception that it slides by nT and not T. Note that the next bin after T1 @ t is  T1 + 1 @ t + n_T, because the size of the bin is n_T.\n\nTypically each stream needs to treated similarly because it represents that same kind of content, however there can be use cases where the stream may be required to be treated differently. A consideration for the API.\n\nImplementation:\n\nIn order to transform a batch stream to a partial bin stream, we can filter the events and put the prorated events in a bin streams representing T @ t, T-1 @ t and so on.\n\nFor this we can define a new DStream which generates a DStream by prorating the data from batch to a bin corresponding to the stream. \n\nFor the use case 2 which requires progressively accumulating all the events for a bin. A new DStream is required which generates a pulsating window which goes from (s_n + 1) to (s_n + n) where s is the partial stream index. A stream index 0 implies that it is the most current partial bin stream.\n## APIs\n\nBinStreamer[T](DStream[T], start: T=>Time, end: T=>Time)\nThis will return a BinStreamer object.\n\nThe BinStreamer object can be used to generate incremental bin streams (case 1)/ final bin (case 3) stream/ updated bin streams (case 2) using the following APIs.\n\nBinStreamer.incrementalStreams(sizeInNumBatches: Int, delayIndex: Int, numStreams: Int) : Seq[BinStream[(T,percentage)]] \n\nBinStreamer.finalStream(sizeInNumBatches: Int, delayIndex: Int) : BinStream[(T,percentage)]\n\nBinStreamer.updatedStreams(sizeInNumBatches: Int, delayIndex: Int, numStreams: Int) : Seq[BinStream[(T,percentage)]]\n\n```\n    DStream[T] : This is the batch stream.\n        start : Closure to get the start time from the record.\nend : Closure to get the end time from the record.\nsizeInNumBatches : The size of bin as a multiple of batch size.\ndelayIndex : The maximum delay between the event relevance and event reception.\n```\n\nnumStreams: This is the number of bin streams. Even though it is fixed by batch size, bin size and the delayIndex. This is an  optional parameter to control the number of output Streams and it does so by delaying the most current bin.\n\nEach BinStream will wrap a DStream.\n\n\f\n  def prorate(binStart: Time, binEnd: Time)(x: T) = {\n\n```\n  val sx = startFunc(x)\n  val ex = endFunc(x)\n\n  // Even though binStart is not inclusive, binStart here implies limit x as x approaches binStart+\n  val s = if (sx > binStart) sx else binStart\n\n  val e = if (ex < binEnd) ex else binEnd\n\n  if (ex == sx) {\n    (x, 1.0)\n  }\n  else {\n    (x, (e - s) / (ex - sx))\n  }\n```\n\n  }\n\n  def filter(binStart: Time, binEnd: Time)(x: T) = {\n\n```\n// The flow is starting in the subsequent bin\nif (startFunc(x) > binEnd) false\n\n// The flow ended in the prior bin\nelse if (endFunc(x) <= binStart) false\n\n// start(x) approaches from binEnd+\nelse if (startFunc(x) == binEnd && endFunc(x) > binEnd) false\n\nelse true\n```\n\n
