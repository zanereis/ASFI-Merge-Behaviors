This will enable implementers of  `DataSegmentKiller` to leverage a batch delete that the underlying storage system may have.  `DataSegmentKiller` has a default method of iterating through all segments and calling delete on them to enable backwards compatibility. Nothing is new is needed to leverage batch delete for s3. We currently use the same s3 api call for other s3 deletions so i have full confidence in this change and have tested this using s3.\r\n\r\n### Manual test case scenarios\r\n\r\ntesting results\r\n\r\n#### Incorrect Access Key\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"api-issued_kill_testPerms2_ppcbonpl_1000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-29T20:00:16.984Z\",\r\n  \"groupId\": \"api-issued_kill_testPerms2_ppcbonpl_1000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-29T20:00:16.984Z\",\r\n  \"type\": \"kill\",\r\n  \"createdTime\": \"2023-06-29T20:00:17.034Z\",\r\n  \"queueInsertionTime\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n  \"statusCode\": \"FAILED\",\r\n  \"status\": \"FAILED\",\r\n  \"runnerStatusCode\": \"WAITING\",\r\n  \"duration\": 7556,\r\n  \"location\": {\r\n    \"host\": \"localhost\",\r\n    \"port\": 8100,\r\n    \"tlsPort\": -1\r\n  },\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"testPerms2\",\r\n  \"errorMsg\": \"org.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoadingException: Couldn't delete segments from s3 see logs ...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[log_invalid_access_key.txt](https://github.com/apache/druid/files/11910740/log_invalid_access_key.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Successful no errors - single bucket\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"api-issued_kill_testPerms4_kghaihhc_1000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-29T19:47:29.211Z\",\r\n  \"groupId\": \"api-issued_kill_testPerms4_kghaihhc_1000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-29T19:47:29.211Z\",\r\n  \"type\": \"kill\",\r\n  \"createdTime\": \"2023-06-29T19:47:29.212Z\",\r\n  \"queueInsertionTime\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n  \"statusCode\": \"SUCCESS\",\r\n  \"status\": \"SUCCESS\",\r\n  \"runnerStatusCode\": \"WAITING\",\r\n  \"duration\": 15724,\r\n  \"location\": {\r\n    \"host\": \"localhost\",\r\n    \"port\": 8100,\r\n    \"tlsPort\": -1\r\n  },\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"testPerms4\",\r\n  \"errorMsg\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[log_delete_no_issues.txt](https://github.com/apache/druid/files/11910752/log_delete_no_issues.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### unable to delete indices\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"api-issued_kill_testPerms3_kjakfgaj_1000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-29T20:52:04.801Z\",\r\n  \"groupId\": \"api-issued_kill_testPerms3_kjakfgaj_1000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-29T20:52:04.801Z\",\r\n  \"type\": \"kill\",\r\n  \"createdTime\": \"2023-06-29T20:52:04.804Z\",\r\n  \"queueInsertionTime\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n  \"statusCode\": \"FAILED\",\r\n  \"status\": \"FAILED\",\r\n  \"runnerStatusCode\": \"WAITING\",\r\n  \"duration\": 7226,\r\n  \"location\": {\r\n    \"host\": \"localhost\",\r\n    \"port\": 8100,\r\n    \"tlsPort\": -1\r\n  },\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"testPerms3\",\r\n  \"errorMsg\": \"org.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoadingException: Couldn't delete segments from s3 see logs ...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[log_delete_no_perms_on_keys.txt](https://github.com/apache/druid/files/11910755/log_delete_no_perms_on_keys.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Successful delete across multiple buckets\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"api-issued_kill_testPerms7_fmpfgjpj_1000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-29T21:46:12.768Z\",\r\n  \"groupId\": \"api-issued_kill_testPerms7_fmpfgjpj_1000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z_2023-06-29T21:46:12.768Z\",\r\n  \"type\": \"kill\",\r\n  \"createdTime\": \"2023-06-29T21:46:12.779Z\",\r\n  \"queueInsertionTime\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n  \"statusCode\": \"SUCCESS\",\r\n  \"status\": \"SUCCESS\",\r\n  \"runnerStatusCode\": \"WAITING\",\r\n  \"duration\": 10321,\r\n  \"location\": {\r\n    \"host\": \"localhost\",\r\n    \"port\": 8100,\r\n    \"tlsPort\": -1\r\n  },\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"testPerms7\",\r\n  \"errorMsg\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[log_delete_across_multiple_buckets.txt](https://github.com/apache/druid/files/11910758/log_delete_across_multiple_buckets.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrough perf test results\r\n~1025 segments deleted in 13seconds batch delete, normal delete took 5 minutes 40 seconds\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nThrough a bit of luck, stumbled into a possible bug with broker parallel merging on certain java versions which can eventually result in all worker threads becoming completely blocked effectively blocking queries.\r\n\r\nI have adjusted the `ParallelMergeCombiningSequenceTest` to check that the pool becomes idle after a short period whenever an exception occurs. The adjust tests fail pretty consistently for me with java 11 and 17, but can repeat indefinitely on java 8 and java 20 on my laptop. Some of these timeout tests are still ever so slightly racy since the exception message can vary slightly depending on which part in the code triggers the timeout exception, but the true important part is that previously missing a check that the pool becomes idle.\r\n\r\nI still haven't determined why this happens, perhaps a java bug or at least some issue with how we are trying to configure/use the pool on these versions. It could also just be an artifact of how the test is written, and not a real issue? Im not really sure yet.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nBroker parallel merge is now disabled for Java versions greater than 8 and less than 20 due to a bug with how this mechanism operates on these versions that can result in all pool threads becoming blocked effectively halting the ability to process most queries. Java 8 and Java 20 do not appear to exhibit these symptoms and so still have parallel result merging enabled by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

adjusts logic in DruidRules that was previously adjusted in #13902. The reason for the original change was that the comment \"Subquery must be a groupBy, so stage must be >= AGGREGATE\" was no longer accurate. Subqueries do not need to be groupBy anymore; they can really be any type of query. If I recall correctly, the change was needed for certain window queries to be able to plan on top of Scan queries.\r\n\r\nHowever, this impacts performance negatively, because it causes many additional outer-query scenarios to be considered, which is expensive.\r\n\r\nSo, this patch updates the matching logic to consider fewer scenarios. The skipped scenarios are ones where we expect that, for one reason or another, it isn't necessary to consider a subquery.","created_at":"2023-04-20T02:11:23Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T16:33:24Z","closed_at":"2023-04-21T15:32:13Z","merged_at":"2023-04-21T15:32:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"f643abdad9592eed91689c38a3b67ad25b7cf10c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis change makes the events emitted by the logging emitter more useful by logging them with the feed of the event as a\r\nlog4j Marker.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates Druid's `Logger` interface to include functions that allows developers to mark log messages with a Marker, and then makes use of them in the `LoggingEmitter`.\r\n\r\nThe output from the logging emitter with the default Druid configuration will now look like\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-04-19T23:54:51,121 INFO [qtp52562984-77] org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.LoggingEmitter - [request_logs] {\"feed\":\"request_logs\",\"service\":\"druid/router\",\"query\":null,\"host\":\"localhost:8888\",\"sql\":\"SELECT 1337\",\"queryStats\":{\"query/time\":537,\"success\":true},\"remoteAddr\":\"[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]\",\"sqlQueryContext\":{\"timeout\":15000,\"sqlQueryId\":\"241a044f-da54-446d-8c16-6b62cace3247\",\"queryId\":\"241a044f-da54-446d-8c16-6b62cace3247\"},\"timestamp\":\"2023-04-19T23:54:51.118Z\"}\r\n2023-04-19T23:49:13,336

operators can now configure their log4j config to route the logs emitted to different locations based on their use. For example, an operator might want to configure different feeds to be written to different files. They can now do this with config that looks like\r\n\r\nIn Druid common.runtime.properties\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid.emitter=logging\r\ndruid.emitter.logging.logLevel=info\r\n# configure request logging via the emitter\r\ndruid.request.logging.type=emitter\r\ndruid.request.logging.feed=request_logs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen update the log4j.xml (by default in `_common/log4j2.xml`) with a new appender and route the logs based on their feeds\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <Appenders>\r\n    ... // Other appender configs\r\n    <File name=\"emitterAppender\" fileName=\"/logs/druid/emitter/%markerSimpleName.log\">\r\n      <PatternLayout pattern=\"%d{ISO8601} - %m%n\"/>\r\n    </File>\r\n  </Appenders>\r\n\r\n  <Loggers>\r\n    ... // Other Logger configs\r\n    <Logger name=\"org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.LoggingEmitter\" level=\"info\" additivity=\"false\">\r\n      <Appender-ref ref=\"emitterAppender\"/>\r\n    </Logger>\r\n  </Loggers>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nChanged: The LoggingEmitter logs messages using [log4j markers](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/markers.html) so that operators can use the markers to re-direct the logs via log4j configuration.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `*/log4j2.xml` - This changes the default log4j config to add Markers to be included in the log if it is specified in the code. \r\n * `processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/common/logger/Logger.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x]

Description\r\n\r\nThis pr fixes a few bugs found with the inputSource security feature.\r\n\r\n1. `KillUnusedSegmentsTask` previously had no definition for the `getInputSourceResources`, which caused an unsupportedOperationException to be thrown when this task type was submitted with the inputSource security feature enabled. This task type should not require any input source specific resources, so returning an empty set for this task type now.\r\n\r\n2. Fixed a bug where when the input source type security feature is enabled, all of the input source type specific resources used where authenticated against:\r\n\r\n`{\"resource\": {\"name\": \"EXTERNAL\", \"type\": \"{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}\"}, \"action\": \"READ\"}`\r\n\r\nWhen they should be instead authenticated against:\r\n\r\n`{\"resource\": {\"name\": \"{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}\", \"type\": \"EXTERNAL\"}, \"action\": \"READ\"}`\r\n\r\n3. fixed bug where supervisor tasks were not authenticated against the specific input source types used, if input source security feature was enabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nThis pr fixes a few bugs found with the inputSource security feature.\r\n\r\n1. `KillUnusedSegmentsTask` previously had no definition for the `getInputSourceResources`, which caused an unsupportedOperationException to be thrown when this task type was submitted with the inputSource security feature enabled. This task type should not require any input source specific resources, so returning an empty set for this task type now.\r\n\r\n2. Fixed a bug where when the input source type security feature is enabled, all of the input source type specific resources used where authenticated against:\r\n\r\n`{\"resource\": {\"name\": \"EXTERNAL\", \"type\": \"{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}\"}, \"action\": \"READ\"}`\r\n\r\nWhen they should be instead authenticated against:\r\n\r\n`{\"resource\": {\"name\": \"{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}\", \"type\": \"EXTERNAL\"}, \"action\": \"READ\"}`\r\n\r\n3. fixed bug where supervisor tasks were not authenticated against the specific input source types used, if input source security feature was enabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

main change is the new tests: we now subclass CalciteJoinQueryTest in CalciteSelectJoinQueryMSQTest twice, once for Broadcast and once for SortMerge.\r\n\r\nTwo supporting production changes for default-value mode:\r\n\r\n1) InputNumberDataSource is marked as concrete, to allow leftFilter to\r\n   be pushed down to it.\r\n\r\n2) In default-value mode, numeric frame field readers can now return nulls.\r\n   This is necessary when stacking joins on top of joins: nulls must be\r\n   preserved for semantics that match broadcast joins and native queries.\r\n\r\n3) In default-value mode, StringFieldReader.isNull returns true on empty\r\n   strings in addition to nulls. This is more consistent with the behavior\r\n   of the selectors, which map empty strings to null as well in that mode.\r\n\r\nAs an effect of change (2), the InsertTimeNull change from #14020 (to replace null timestamps with default timestamps) is reverted. IMO, this is fine, as either behavior is defensible, and the change from #14020 hasn't been released yet.","created_at":"2023-04-18T03:23:46Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T19:10:27Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T19:10:24Z","merged_at":"2023-04-25T19:10:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"89e7948159771735908e3e68823356ecd34df93a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the property `maxResultsSize` from the S3OutputConfig. That property was used to limit the max size that can be fetched from the S3 (and used primarily in the durable storage of MSQ).\r\nHowever, since we now chunk downloads from S3, we donot need such a guardrail and the property can be removed from the config. \r\nMoreover, a default chunk size of 100MiB has been introduced (earlier it was calculated based on the value passed in the `maxResultsSize`). Removing `maxResultsSize` also clears up the hurdles associated with calculating the appropriate chunkSize.  \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\"maxResultsSize\" has been removed from the S3OutputConfig and a default \"chunkSize\" of 100MiB is now present. This change primarily affects users who wish to use durable storage for MSQ jobs.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `S3OutputConfig`\r\n * `RetryableS3OutputStream`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug when trying to filter `COMPLEX<json>` columns where omission of setting the `isFilterable` flag of `ColumnCapabilities` when reading the column was incorrectly causing the column to be treated as if it were all null values. The deserializers have been updated to set `isFilterable` to true, allow `COMPLEX<json>` columns to be used in expression filters, which can often be generated by the SQL planner for queries like the added SQL test.\r\n\r\nI'm not really certain how useful this behavior is, and it doesn't seem very intuitive, so we might want to consider changing this in the future so that `COMPLEX` columns produce some form of error when used with filters which do not support the type. It might have made sense in the past when there was not really a possible way for complex types to participate in filtering, but since expressions now support complex types it becomes relatively easy to imagine using these columns in filters when used with expressions which can extract meaningful data from the complex types (such as get the estimate from an HLL sketch, or .. extract a value from a json blob as in this case).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixed a bug when using expression filters for filtering `COMPLEX<json>` columns or values extracted from them using `JSON_VALUE` or any other nested column function, where the column would be incorrectly treated as all null values.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR

change will allow for log4j to be configured for peons but require console logging is still configured for them to ensure peon logs are saved to deep storage.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed the test ConsoleLoggingEnforcementTest to use a valid appender for the non console Config as the previous config was incorrect and would never return a logger.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis change will allow for multiple log4j appenders to be configured for peons but still require console logging is configured for them to ensure peon logs are saved to deep storage.\r\n\r\nIf a ConsoleAppender is not configured, the peon will ignore the configured log4j appenders and use only a ConsoleAppender.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nChanged: Peon logs can now be configured with multiple log4j2 Appenders. Previously, peon logs could only be configured with a ConsoleAppender. On upgrade, there is a chance peon logs will start logging to different appenders if a Logger used by the peon has multiple appenders configured and one of them is a console appender.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ConsoleLoggingEnforcementConfigurationFactory`\r\n * `ConsoleLoggingEnforcementTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Caller can still control the behavior by passing in the expected responses (in addition to 200), in which case the response is returned without any internal retries. The internal retries with cache-invalidation are best-effort, in case of continuous failure, failed response is returned to the caller. This keeps the existing behavior of the API as is.\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nThis PR adjusts the behavior of `useSchemaDiscovery` to if set also include the behavior of `includeAllDimensions`, meaning that if `useSchemaDiscovery` is set ingestion will use any explicitly defined dimensions and then use the 'auto' schema for any additional dimensions not explicitly specified. This makes the `useSchemaDiscovery` name make a bit more sense, as it means schema discovery will always be enabled even when the schema is partially defined, and avoids the need to set two flags to support partial schema declaration with the new and improved schema discovery mode enabled by `useSchemaDiscovery`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR adds attributes that contain metadata information about the query in the `EXPLAIN PLAN` output. The attributes currently contain two items:\r\n- `statementKind`: denotes the overall statement type -- possible values `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `REPLACE`\r\n- `targetDataSource`: provides the target datasource name for DML statements\r\n\r\nA new method `explainAttributes`, is added to the `SqlStatementHandler` interface, and the Select, Insert, and Replace handlers implement the methods. The value is then obtained from the statement handler during query planning and set in the planner context. \r\n\r\nFor backward compatibility, these attributes are included as a third column to the outputâ€”updated docs to reflect the output changes. Also, it is added to both the legacy and native query plan outputs.\r\n\r\nThe  `EXPLAIN PLAN` output for a `SELECT` query is in [the README](https://github.com/abhishekrb19/incubator-druid/blob/explain_plan_enhancements/docs/querying/sql-translation.md#interpreting-explain-plan-output).

Description\r\n`LONG` is currently the (semi?) official boolean type in Druid, even more-so if `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans` is set to true (which it is not in the code, but is defined as true in the distribution default runtime.properties for new installs to use the better behavior). However, ingesting boolean data with the 'long' dimension schema currently fails since the `LongDimensionIndexer` does not expect to handle this type of input. As a workaround one can currently use an expression transform to coerce the boolean to a long (if strict booleans is enabled), but that's sort of sad. This PR fixes this by adding support to coercing booleans to longs using the same functions as the expressions.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes some bugs with the sampler response after #14014, where the 'logical' dimensions list was still specifying 'json' instead of the newer 'auto' schema.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nThe native ingestion `\"long\"` dimension schema can now handle boolean inputs, which will be coerced to 1L or 0L for true or false values respectively.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n-

Description\r\nFixes another regression related to #14014, this time when processing all null or nonexistent columns with the 'json' (v4) format. Added a test to ensure that non-existent data is processed correctly, and tests for explicit 'auto' dimension schema with non-existent columns to ensure new common format also doesn't have any issues with non-existent columns.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

Description\r\n\r\nThis change backports the following 2 prs: (#14050, #14056)\r\n\r\n#14050 allows for input sources used during MSQ ingestion to be authorized for multiple input source types, instead of just 1. Such an input source that allows for multiple types is the CombiningInputSource.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed bug that caused some input source specific functions to be authorized against the permissions\r\n\r\n`\r\n[\r\n  new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, ResourceType.EXTERNAL), Action.READ),\r\n  new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, {input_source_type}), Action.READ)\r\n]\r\n`\r\n\r\nwhen the inputSource based authorization feature is enabled, when it should instead be authorized against\r\n\r\n`\r\n[\r\n  new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, {input_source_type}), Action.READ)\r\n]\r\n`\r\n\r\n#14056 fixed a bug where msq controller and worker tasks did not have implementations for the `getInputSourceResources() `method. This causes the submission of these tasks to fail if the following auth config is enabled:\r\n\r\n`druid.auth.enableInputSourceSecurity=true`\r\n\r\nAdded implementations of this method for these tasks that return an empty set of input sources. This means that for these task types, if `druid.auth.enableInputSourceSecurity=true` config is used, the input source types will be properly computed and authorized in the SQL layer, but not if the equivalent controller / worker tasks are submitted to the task endpoint.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

was a change that tried to get indexing to run on multiple disks It made a bunch of changes to how tasks run, effectively hiding the \"safe\" directory for tasks to write files into from the task code itself making it extremely difficult to do anything correctly inside of a task.\r\n\r\nThis change reverts those changes (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13476) inside of the tasks and makes it so that only the task runners are the ones that make decisions about which mount points should be used for storing task-related files.\r\n\r\nIt adds the config druid.worker.baseTaskDirs which can be used by the task runners to know which directories they should schedule tasks inside of. The TaskConfig remains the authoritative source of configuration for where and how an individual task should be operating.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nTasks can now run using multiple different mount points for temporary storage.  Set `druid.worker.baseTaskDirs` to an array of locations to enable!","created_at":"2023-04-11T08:53:09Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T07:45:14Z","closed_at":"2023-04-13T07:45:02Z","merged_at":"2023-04-13T07:45:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"aaa6cc18836553e90f5d8111ecb2f793925199b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

the user has to configure `composedIntermediateSuperSorterStorageEnabled` and `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` for each query. However, these are generally not something that users would be able to decide. This has been moved to a runtime parameter, so that they can be configured by the manager of the cluster. This would make reduce the number of potential configurations a user has to make.\r\n\r\n**Release notes**\r\n- Adds new run time parameter `druid.indexer.task.tmpStorageBytesPerTask`. This sets a limit for the amount of temporary storage disk space used by tasks. This limit is currently only respected by MSQ tasks.\r\n- Removes query context parameters `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` and `composedIntermediateSuperSorterStorageEnabled`. Composed intermediate super sorter (which was enabled by `composedIntermediateSuperSorterStorageEnabled`) is now enabled automatically if `durableShuffleStorage` is set to true. `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` is calculated from the limit set by the run time parameter `druid.indexer.task.tmpStorageBytesPerTask`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nFixes a regression when ingesting 'v4' nested format columns caused by shuffling around some stuff when refactoring during review of #14014. I realized that I forgot to switch some of the tests back to using the v4 format, so Ive swapped the 'tsv' format tests to go back to using 'json' instead of 'auto' to ingest the test data (there are no arrays in that data so there is no difference in functional behavior between v4 and the new common format).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nFixes a bug with `FrontCodedIndexedWriter` and `FrontCodedIntArrayIndexedWriter` which were not counting the null value for the `getCardinality` method, which is used by the new nested common format columns for handling value dictionaries during merge and serialization. This results in array index out of bounds exceptions since the mutable bitmap array is initialized from the value cardinality.\r\n\r\nThe added lines in the tests would cause them all to fail without the changes to the writers.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

main change is that MSQ results are now coerced the same way that the regular SQL endpoint coerces results. So, for example:\r\n\r\n- null strings are replaced by `\"\"` (empty string) in default-value mode\r\n- multi-value strings are stringified if their SQL type is VARCHAR\r\n- arrays are stringified based on the value of `sqlStringifyArrays` if their SQL type is ARRAY\r\n- complex types are serialized based on the value of `serializeComplexValues`\r\n- etc\r\n\r\nThe supporting changes are:\r\n\r\n- Move `NativeQueryMaker.coerce` to `SqlResults`;\r\n- Formally make the list of `sqlTypeNames` from the MSQ results reports use `SqlTypeName`; and\r\n- Restore the truth of the comment that `sqlQueryContext` is \"not used by any other Druid

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Return task status generated by Peon in KuberentesTaskRunner\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThe KubernetesTaskRunner determines the status of a completed task by looking at the status of the containers the job ran (Kubernetes marks a container as failed if it exits with a non zero exit code).  If any of the containers succeeded, the task is reported as successful.  If any of the containers failed, the task is reported as failed.\r\n\r\nThis way of determining final task status is incorrect for the following reasons\r\n1. A task that fails gracefully will result in the Peon having an exit code of zero (for example cancelled tasks)\r\n2. Granular information on task success or failure are lost since the KubernetesTaskRunner creates a new task status object with simple messages.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Adds a method to push and stream task status from object storage\r\n#### Peon pushes task status to object storage\r\n#### KubernetesTaskRunner returns task status read from object storage\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf the Druid cluster is upgraded from a version that does not have this change to a version that does, peons running the old version of the code will not write their task status to object storage.  When the task completes the KubernetesTaskRunner will use the previous logic in order to preserve backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesTaskRunner`\r\n * `AbstractTask`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

An ISO week-numbering year (also called ISO year informally) has 52 or 53 full weeks. That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual 365 or 366 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nDiscovered a race condition in the shutdown code while doing some additional testing around https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/f60f377e5f67221f8a4a34163b257ecffece60d7\r\n\r\nIf a task is shutdown, has its k8s job deleted and then subsequently removed from the tasks map on https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/kubernetes-overlord-extensions/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/k8s/overlord/KubernetesTaskRunner.java#L218, \r\nit is possible for the pod to still be running in a terminating state for a little while after. this is because k8s deletes the controller (the job) and then lets the pod clean itself up.\r\n\r\nIf getKnownTasks (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/kubernetes-overlord-extensions/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/k8s/overlord/KubernetesTaskRunner.java#L338) is called by the TaskQueue main loop between when the tasks table is cleaned up and the peon pod finishes deleting, another run() will be called by getKnownTasks.\r\n\r\nNormally this sees the existing future in the tasks table and returns it, but since the task id will already have been deleted from the tasks table, the task runner will actually start another job with the same name as the original one that was deleted.\r\n\r\nThis job will quickly be deleted again (because getKnownTasks will return it, the taskQueue will see the task that the task runner returned is not in TaskStorage and submit another shutdown request to delete the job), but this is a poor user experience.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there may be DuplicateKeyError's thrown because there are multiple pods with the same job name running, this can cause the ingestion to be briefly nonresponsive.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to get these DuplicateKeyErrors if a pod (not a job) is manually deleted in K8s. Normally, since we set backoffLimit to 0, if a pod fails, the job doesn't try to retry creating the pod and just fails out. But it seems like k8s treats manual termination differently from a pod failing, so when a pod is manually terminated, the job actually starts another pod.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMO it makes more sense for getKnownTasks to try to rehydrate state from Kubernetes via the list of jobs, rather than the list of Pods. This solves both of the above problems because we can be sure the K8s job has been deleted before deleting the task future from the tasks map, and there will never be duplicate jobs with the same name.\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nBugfixes to the kubernetes overlord extension\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n- The change here to have toTask take in the Job object rather than the Pod object and then use this change to have getKnownTasks and getRunningTasks list jobs rather than pods when trying to read the k8s state.\r\n\r\n\r\nI explored some other options for fixing this issue, such as excluding terminating pods from getKNownTasks and getRunningTasks or having the main run loop wait for pods to delete if the job has been deleted, but this seemed like the cleanest solution.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ X been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

For example: -->\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 items.\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade the k8s client to support newer versions of k8s.\r\n2. Ability to override specific Metrics Monitors\r\nWe found that when we used the TaskCountStatsMonitor in the overlord config, the peon tasks would not start because they inherit the monitors from the parent process, which used to be the Middle Manager (but that would never have that monitor originally).

of a gRPC query endpoint per issue #13469.\r\n\r\nProvides a single gRPC-based endpoint for SQL queries. The query request is similar to the existing REST `SqlQuery` class. The response is gRPC-specific. It provides the result schema along with the results as a binary \"blob\". Results can be in CSV, JSON array lines or as an array of Protobuf objects. If using Protobuf, the corresponding class must be installed along with the rRPC query extension so it is available to the Broker at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe PR includes both unit and integration tests. The PR includes additional files that are also offered in other PRs. The intent is that those other PRs ([#13877](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13877) and [#14009](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14009)) are merged first, then this one merges with master so that the other files \"disappear\" from this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR also has a number of code-cleanup changes encountered while doing the implementation.\r\n\r\nSee the `README.md` file in the PR for details. See the [`query.proto`](https://github.com/apache/druid/compare/master...paul-rogers:druid:grpc-query?expand=1#diff-64b5e59c67151a4b864bf0a34f31c66a53c3612a888ef974dce28c478d444279) file for the gRPC protocol and Protobuf messages.\r\n\r\nhe project consists of three Maven modules:\r\n\r\n* `grpc-query`: The actual gRPC query endpoint.\r\n* `grpc-query-it`: Integration tests for the extension.\r\n* `grpc-shaded`: Creates a shaded jar containing gRPC and our rRPC service definition.\r\n\r\nThe shaded module is needed because gRPC uses a version of Guava different than that which Druid uses. We get runtime errors if we try to combine the two. The shaded module contains the service definition because that generates code that also uses Guava.\r\n\r\nThe IT module has to be separate because it has dependencies that occur in the Maven build after the gRPC module. Specifically, it depends on it-cases which must come after distribution, but grpc-query must come before distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThis is a \"contrib\" extension. We don't seem to document such extensions in Druid itself. The `README.md` can serve as documentation instead.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests
