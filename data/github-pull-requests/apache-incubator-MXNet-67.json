Description ##\r\nDocumentation\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR tries to fix the performance degradation report in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9874\r\n\r\nWe observed about 4% performance decrease. There are multiple factors that cause the performance decrease.\r\n* The first one is that the refactored code passes more arrays to the backward of BatchNorm.\r\n* The second one is that the refactored code needs to reinitialize the CuDNN states in every forward and backward.\r\n* The third one is that the refactor code leads to more memory allocation (e.g., creating std::vector) in forward and backward. (However, the test shows that this doesn't cause much performance decrease.)\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to reduce these overhead.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-14T20:33:54Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T21:00:46Z","closed_at":"2018-03-22T05:53:33Z","merged_at":"2018-03-22T05:53:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"46e47cbc6183d2812a2e405851f0b209383e72ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10116/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10116/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10116/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/db21715e1758943f0fab048b461eb7ecf039c5ce","head":{"label":"zheng-da:fix_cudnn_perf","ref":"fix_cudnn_perf","sha":"db21715e1758943f0fab048b461eb7ecf039c5ce","user":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103710066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MTAwNjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best

Description ##\r\nThis was created during development but then its use was deprecated. It's not actually used at all anymore, so removing it.\r\n\r\nLeaving ProfileObject in for now based soley on its virtual destructor, but may remove at a later date.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a

Description ##\r\nThis PR upgrades our CI from CUDA 8.0 to CUDA 9.1 and CuDNN from 5 to 7.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- CUDA 8.0 -> 9.1\r\n- CuDNN 5 -> 7\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis change requires an update on our slaves because CUDA 9.1 is not supported by nvidia-docker. It requires nvidia-docker2 which will be provided with the new slaves.\r\n\r\nI had to do some lint fixes. Although we stick the version, it still seems to be flaky about detecting some things - I don't really understand what's going on there. I've tried to use older versions as well, but it always found some

Description\r\nIn this PR, a fused LSTM operator for CPU is implemented. More supports for other RNN variants are WIP and will be submitted in other PRs.\r\n\r\n## Feature changes\r\n### New features\r\n* Fused LSTM implemention, including both forward and backward computation.\r\n* Share the same frontend interfaces with current `sym.RNN` operator\r\n* Share the same algorithm and input layout with current `sym.RNN` operator\r\n* ~~Refactor code and register it with NNVM interfaces~~\r\n* Support both FP32 and FP64 inputs, more types will be supported later, such as int8\r\n* Provide more extensible APIs for other RNN variants(vanilla RNN/GRU)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Unit-test changes\r\n* Create new test `test_lstm` and `test_lstm_bidirectional`in `tests/python/unittests/test_operator.py` \r\n* Check consistency with original LSTMCell implementation\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\nWe have tested performance of `sym.RNN` and `rnn.LSTMCell` on our local Skylake-8180 with 2 Sockets and 56 cores. Use MKL as blas lib in this performance test.\r\nTest input size is from DS2 default parameters(seq_length = 300, batch_size = 20, input_size = 800, hidden_size = 800).\r\n\r\n**single layer

PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to

DepthwiseConv2dBackwardFilterKernel from tensorflow codebase, which is over 5x faster\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nThe current mxnet implementation calls __syncthreads() function too much, which is extemely slow.\r\nThe new code comes from tensorflow, but the variable names are adjusted for consistency.\r\n\r\nMy model uses depthwise conv heavily, and now its training time per iteration is over 5x faster on single P40 gpu.  ( old 92s vs new 18s )\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix #9405\r\nThe problem is that when no naming is provided for symbol it appends a count to the name. For bucketing module, since the params need to be shared between modules for different buckets,\r\nthe param names used need to be the same. Forcing to use same naming for params in BucketingModule.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin

Description ##\r\nThe operator `quadratic` is used as an example of this [tutorial](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/faq/add_op_in_backend.html), while its implementation is kept in my personal repo. Now move it to the public repo and will change the corresponding links in the tutorial to the new ones after this PR is merged.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin

Description ##\r\n\r\nFix for: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10042\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, the new approach isn't fork-friendly.  Just reverted to the previous code for this function from before my PR: 106f97f1881e6bb1a00c56a0ae55200e27297733\r\n\r\nThe code change in that PR was just a small performance-optimization change.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nPreviously, some activation types in MKLDNN aren't used because there was a precision problem. \r\nThis is to enable all activations in MKLDNN.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nRe-enables MXNET_MKLDNN_DEBUG flag to ensure more thorough testing\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Enable MXNET_MKLDNN_DEBUG in CI dockerfiles\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nFix https://discuss.mxnet.io/t/lazy-update-with-adam-optimizer-is-much-slower-for-sparse-input/724\r\n\r\nMany kernels written for row_sparse ndarrays are slow on GPU. For example, in sparse SGD, the kernel has the following logic using `kernel::launch`:\r\n```cpp\r\n# pragma parallel for\r\nfor (i = 0 ... num_nonzero_rows) {\r\n    # thread i computes an entire row in the output\r\n    row = indices[i]\r\n    for (col = 0 .. num_columns) \r\n        output[row][col] = weight - lr * grad \r\n}\r\n```\r\nSuch \"parallelization by rows\"(**A**) works fine on CPU but is problematic on GPU, because:\r\n- when num_nonzero_rows is small, only a small number of cuda threads are launched. GPU utilization will be low\r\n-  the memory access pattern is horrible. GPU threads are launched as groups of warps. Each thread in the same warp are accessing different memory location, resulting 32x more unnecessary memory transactions. \r\n\r\nInstead, the kernels on GPU should be \"parallelized by the number of elements\"(**B**) to update. This way, all threads in the same warp are accessing the same chunk of memory. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I apply **B** on CPU with openmp, I see the performance is 3-4x slower. Hence I only applied **B** for GPUs in this PR. (I didn't dig deeper why this happens - the performance should be comparable if static openmp scheduling is used.I didn't check what default omp scheduling strategy is on my instance. Maybe @cjolivier01 has more insight on cpu performance?). \r\n\r\ntime(s) for 300 iterations for lazy_update=True (26x improvement)\r\n\r\n|nnr | 1280           | 12800          | \r\n|----------------|----------------|---|\r\n|Before| 1.31863999367  | 13.2637498379  | \r\n|After| 0.050815820694 | 0.430017948151 |\r\n\r\ntime(s) for 30 iterations for lazy_update=False (34x improvement)\r\n\r\n|nnr | 1280           | 12800          | \r\n|----------------|----------------|---|\r\n|Before| 22.2087020874  | 21.9239070415  | \r\n|After| 0.658735990524 | 0.678998947144 |\r\n\r\n(Just want to trigger the CI.

this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n@aaronmarkham Please review!\r\nThe installation test script is checking for hardcoded strings in the index.md. This PR adds these strings back such that the test passes. (script - https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/tests/jenkins/run_test_installation_docs.sh)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] added back two strings needed by installation guide test to the index.md file

[x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

We start by showing a complete example using Gluon's [`mxnet.gluon.data.Dataset`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/data.html#mxnet.gluon.data.Dataset), and then unpack the example to gain a greater understanding of the internals. In the process you'll learn about augmentation functions, [`mxnet.image.Augmenter`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/image/image.html?highlight=augmen#mxnet.image.Augmenter) classes and Augmenter lists. We also provide examples using [`mxnet.image.ImageIter`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/image/image.html?highlight=imageiter#mxnet.image.ImageIter) if you haven't yet moved to

code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible

Description ##\r\nFix #9997\r\n@anirudh2290 @reminisce \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis operator randomly shuffles an NDArray along the first axis. The order of the elements in each subarray does not change. For exmaple, if an NDArray `x` is shuffled, the order of the subarrays `x[i]` randomly changes but the order of the elements in each `x[i]` does not change. This PR is a revise of #9991.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\n1. In cpu, the shuffling of an 1D array is delegated to `__gnu_parallel::random_shuffle`, which utilizes openmp, for clang on linux and gcc on any OS and delegated to `std::shuffle` for other platforms. For an multidimensional array, the usual Fisher-Yates shuffling is implemented.\r\n2. In gpu, for a multidimensional array, it shuffles the array of indices representing the subarrays and then rearrange the elements of the data array according to the shuffled index array. To shuffle the index array, a random key is generated for each index and then the indices are sorted by the keys. If the given array is 1D, it sorts the array directly with random keys instead of sorting the indices. The sorting is delegated to mshadow's `SortByKey` which again delegates the call to thrust's `sort_by_key`. This implementation is essentially equivalent to `__gnu_parallel::random_shuffle` while the random key generation and sorting are fused in gnu's implementation.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThis operator is modeled on `numpy.random.shuffle`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Dropout operator with axes, unit tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n-

Description ##\r\n1. Directly implement layer normalization in C++. The speed and memory cost are both better than the way of stacking the broadcast/reduce OPs. Solves https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9950\r\n2. Add LayerNorm in Gluon\r\n3. Fix the doc of InstanceNorm. In InstanceNorm, the real axis to normalize the input tensor is all axes excluding the 0th axis and the given axis.\r\n4. Fix the doc of BatchNorm, the inverse std instead of the var is set as the output.

Description ##\r\nFix bug for a recent PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9931\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests,

Description ##\r\nThis example reproduces the result (~42 perplexity) on [Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02410.pdf) on the GBW dataset. \r\nSee `readme.mk` for details. \r\n@mli @szha @zheng-da @piiswrong \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best

calling error while calling im2rec.py in prepare_dataset.py\r\nadd threads support in prepare_dataset.py\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nSince the im2rec.py is changed, the calling method in prepare_dataset.py in ssd is invalid. Thus, modified the code to allow converting data correctly. Also, added threads support to improve converting speed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best

Description ##\r\nrefactor of download logic in #9986 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n    Added operators:\r\n    - AvgPool\r\n    - ArgMax\r\n    - ArgMin\r\n    - Abs\r\n    \r\n    Minor changes in logic for import_onnx\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThe pooling operator still complains about not assigning the kernel size when the \"global_pool\" parameter is assigned to be \"True\";\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nOne of the customer is upgrading MXNet from v0.11.0 to v1.1.0 and would like to this operator to be ported on v1.1.0 on the master branch\r\n\r\ni cherry-picked the change from master(commit id) 6ebec87127a7dfb10e902df20282434a1612e35f and applied to v1.1.0. there was some change required for the activation function, so i had to manually change that\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

(`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis operator randomly shuffles the elements of an NDArray along the last axis, i.e., it performs a batched shuffling. For example, if you shuffle a matrix (2D array), the elements in each row are shuffled inside the row and the shufflings in different rows are statistically independent. So, for each element, all indices except the last one perserved but the last one changes randomly. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n1. Random shuffle is a widely used operation so that most of the random number APIs, such as those of numpy or C++, have it while mxnet lacks the operation. It would be useful especially for the shuffling of the arrays in gpu.\r\n2. If this PR is accepted I'd like to open a separate PR which removes the dependency of mxnet python API on the *global* random number generators of python and numpy. I think that the dependency is not sound because it introduces an unnecessary coupling between mxnet and other parts of a user's environment. This can be a source of subtle technical or mathematical bugs. Personally I have spent some amount of meaningless time to figure out the source of an unexpected randomness due to the coupling. The dependency has confused many newcomers, for example, see #9978, #9335, #7124 and #736. To replace random number generations through the global generators of python and numpy with the generations through the operations of `mx.nd.random`, we need to copy the data back and forth between a numpy array and an NDArray or a python list and an NDArray, but I think that the overhead from this is not significant and avoiding the coupling is much more important. When I actually tried the replacing, the only obstacle was that mxnet does not support the random shuffling. So I implemented it. However, I think that the suffling is useful regardless of this motivation and so opened a separate PR.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\n1. In cpu, the shuffling is delegated to `__gnu_parallel::random_shuffle`, which utilizes openmp, for gcc and clang and to `std::shuffle` for other compilers. The shufflings in a batch are processed sequentially one by one.\r\n2. In gpu, a random key of `double` type is generated for each element of the array and then the elements are sorted by the keys. The keys for `n`-th batch is distributed in the range `[n, n + 1)` and the entire array is sorted by the keys at once. The sorting is delegated to mshadow's `SortByKey` which again delegates the call to thrust's `sort_by_key`. If both of the batch size and the length of the last axis are very large, the qualitiy of the shuffling could be bad in this implementation, i.e., the outcomes may not be uniformly distributed. It is because, as `n` grows,  the number of floating point numbers in `[n, n+1]` becomes smaller and so the probability that there are duplicated keys grows. However, I believe that it hardly causes a problem in practice. If this is not acceptable, an alternative implementation is to process the shufflings in a batch sequentially. However, this alternative shows very poor performance comparing to the current implementation even when the batch size is some hundreds.\r\n3. Inplace shuffling is allowed. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x]

`step` to Tensorboard. Currently only horizontal axis setting of `Relative` or `Wall` are available without any info about the epoch.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nCurrent Tensorboard integration with `dmlc/tensorboard` allows good visualizations for MXNET training/eval procedure. However, visualizations are limited to horizontal axis setting of `Relative` or `Wall` and do not include any information about current epoch OR relation between the plots and epoch. \r\n\r\nAfter spending some time on the code at `dmlc/tensorboard`, I found that the [add_scalar](https://github.com/dmlc/tensorboard/blob/master/python/tensorboard/writer.py#L264) function have an argument named `global_step` to log `step` or `epoch` information. I added a simple fix to the [tensorboard.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/contrib/tensorboard.py) in MXNET to address this lost information. Kindly take a look at the figures below:\r\n\r\nTensorboard plots BEFORE FIX:\r\n1.

Description ##\r\ngluon language modeling dataset and text token reader\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best

Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nReproduced LSTMP 2048-512 baseline, achieving test ppl ~42 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02410.pdf \r\nThe PR still contains many unnecessary changes. Will be cleaned up soon.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\nCPU LSTM inference kernel. \r\nThis is around 9.5x faster than gluon LSTM cell.\r\n\r\nVerified on speech recognition task, as well as on unittest.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the

New unary ops\r\n\r\n* Improved unit tests for basic unary, binary ops\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nAdds unary ops norm_logcdf, norm_derivlogcdf for log CDF of standard normal. Basic functionality (see scipy.stats.norm), required to implement Bayesian optimization or expectation propagation.\r\nAlso improved unit tests for basic unary, binary ops. Now, comparison to NumPy done for float64 only, then float64 code is compared to float32, float16.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-02T09:18:54Z","updated_at":"2018-03-03T10:49:47Z","closed_at":"2018-03-03T10:49:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57106304679882d5aa00f173ec0b9fa915b21dc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9961/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9961/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9961/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/971b10f42c102b2507199fdeb4fe47d350e4ccb9","head":{"label":"mseeger:mseeger-logcdf2","ref":"mseeger-logcdf2","sha":"971b10f42c102b2507199fdeb4fe47d350e4ccb9","user":{"login":"mseeger","id":6508962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDg5NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6508962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger","html_url":"https://github.com/mseeger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c7f9331f0687e6847e6355a3ae670a096cee714e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.c

Description ##\r\n\r\npass the label data to the augmenter implementation so that the label could be changed when image transformation applied during augmentation.\r\nIt is useful for regression task such as landmark localization.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-02T07:35:51Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T22:45:34Z","closed_at":"2018-03-20T22:45:34Z","merged_at":"2018-03-20T22:45:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"a196c2f0d4f9e5d70767f465d1c65bda3f85f241","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d98c4fb68befcfb1685f12da204f25f50de38453","head":{"label":"nihui:master","ref":"master","sha":"d98c4fb68befcfb1685f12da204f25f50de38453","user":{"login":"nihui","id":171016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui","html_url":"https://github.com/nihui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114628999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ2Mjg5OTk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"nihui/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nihui","id":171016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui","html_url":"https://github.com/nihui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nihui/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nDoc changes\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- MXNET_KVSTORE_REDUCTION_NTHREADS\r\n-

This results in intermittent failures as shown here: http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/incubator-mxnet/detail/PR-9869/10/pipeline/466\r\n\r\nTested with the failing seed: 1754533767\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n-

Description ##\r\nThe multi_proposal operator (`mxnet.sym.contrib.MultiProposal`, CPU version) is not implemented before.\r\nI wrote the code about it.\r\n\r\nAnd I found there was a bug in *proposal.cu* and *multi_proposal.cu*.\r\nThe `batch_size` of the output of *Proposal* and *MultiProposal* are both `param_.rpn_post_nms_top_n`.\r\nWhen `count_anchors < param_.rpn_post_nms_top_n`, the variable `rpn_post_nms_top_n` will be `count_anchors`, which is less than `param_.rpn_post_nms_top_n`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/contrib/proposal.cu#L438\r\n\r\nIt will cause the problem that the output whose index is larger than `rpn_post_nms_top_n` will be *not assigned*.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Multi Proposal Operator is supported on the CPU context.\r\n- [x] Add unit-test for Multi Proposal Operator\r\n- [x] Add cpu/gpu consistency test for Proposal and MultiProposal\r\n- [x] Fix `PrepareOutput` bug in proposal op (GPU) and multi_proposal op(GPU)\r\n- [x] Fix the output's difference  between Proposal (CPU)  and Proposal (GPU) \r\n- [x] Use omp to optimize the loops in Proposal(CPU) and MultiProposal(CPU) \r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nIn some corner cases, the MKLDNN library link path (-L$(MKLDNNROOT)/lib, this could be a local path) will not be used but some system path (like /usr/local/lib, get via \"pkg-config --libs opencv\", this path may contain some stale mkldnn library) will be used first, in such case, mxnet/im2rec would be linked to unexpected mkldnn library and will cause issue. The fix is to move MKLDNN link path settings ahead before opencv so local MKLDNN library path will be used first during link time.\r\n\r\nRace condition reproduce criteria:  opencv and a stable/old version mkldnn library both installed into the same path (like /usr/local/lib), and start mxnet build (enable MKLDNN compile flag).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-03-01T02:39:14Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T05:55:28Z","closed_at":"2018-03-16T05:55:28Z","merged_at":"2018-03-16T05:55:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"b87c63de391a9e837e1ff2ace0b0ed808882a966","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9936/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9936/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9936/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9df264e62f9d8333594e9f834db99b8d987675a5","head":{"label":"jinhuang415:master","ref":"master","sha":"9df264e62f9d8333594e9f834db99b8d987675a5","user":{"login":"jinhuang415","id":34262351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjYyMzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34262351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhuang415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":116924050,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTY5MjQwNTA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"jinhuang415/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinhuang415","id":34262351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjYyMzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34262351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhuang415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinhuang415/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nWhen the input sequences have different lengths, the common approach is to pad them to the same length and feed the padded data into the recurrent neural network. To deal with this scenario, this PR adds a new `valid_length` option in `unroll`. `valid_length` refers to the real length of the sequences before padding. When the `valid_length` is given, the last valid state will be returned and the padded portion in the output will be masked to be zero. This feature is essential for implementing a NMT model.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] valid_length option in unroll, tests\r\n- [x] replace `expand_dim + concat` with `stack`. This reduces the memory usage.\r\n\r\n### Comments ###\r\nThe ConvRNN cells do not support this feature.","created_at":"2018-03-01T01:38:30Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T11:47:53Z","closed_at":"2018-03-08T18:38:37Z","merged_at":"2018-03-08T18:38:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"f04edb5045c3134f8d055d17185f35ff6e0f98fa","assignee":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9934/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9934/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9934/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5fe3c5e1e32ad1ea820f32996281bf1014f40da2","head":{"label":"sxjscience:enable_variable_length_rnn","ref":"enable_variable_length_rnn","sha":"5fe3c5e1e32ad1ea820f32996281bf1014f40da2","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience/mxnet","description":"

Description ##\r\nAllows profiling of kvstore server through the profiler API with a new variable `profile_process` \r\n\r\n```\r\nmx.profiler.set_config(..., profile_process='server')\r\n```\r\nUses kvstore dist's support for sending command to servers to communicate messages from worker to server regarding profiling.\r\n\r\nSee example in `common/fit.py`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Changes in c_api and python kvstore to add functions to set profiler configs, state, etc\r\n- [x] KVDist passes these commands to server\r\n- [x] KVDistServer calls the profiler API using above commands\r\n- [x] Added an example in common/fit.py to use for all example/image-classification/* scripts\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-01T01:36:20Z","updated_at":"2018-06-09T02:00:53Z","closed_at":"2018-06-09T02:00:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2adb0e1d9681ae7cef51c085d930311a4b4ce1cb","assignee":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9933/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9933/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9933/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/69f5ec7ccfc1270914f441be22f6a373b2769cc3","head":{"label":"rahul003:server-profile","ref":"server-profile","sha":"69f5ec7ccfc1270914f441be22f6a373b2769cc3","user":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96937059,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjkzNzA1OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"rahul003/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","followi

Description ##\r\n1. Fixes issue where thread id can be hex, and the hex symbols are not recognized by chrome tracing tool. Using hash to convert it to an integer\r\n\r\n2. The json file has some missing commas because of the first_flag condition. The reason for this seems lost at this point. Removing it bring back the comma necessary for a valid json. Verified that it does generate valid jsons by training a network. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- See

MKL part hasn't been updated\r\n\r\n@szha Could you test this implementation? ping @yzhliu for MKL implementation\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix #9865 by reshaping both `label` and `pred`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best

are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API
