was not actually testing anything\r\nbecause it fired off asynchronous tasks, but failed to see if those\r\ntasks threw an exception.\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, the test always got an exception.  It installed a\r\ntest hook to prevent the CQ from starting. That prevented any events\r\nfrom being queued up. The test then waited for all events to be received\r\non the client, which timed out.\r\n\r\nReimplemented the test to test the condition described in the comments,\r\nmaking sure that calling executeWithInitialResults twice does not lose\r\nevents that are queued up already.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
