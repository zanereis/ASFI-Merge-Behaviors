What is this PR for?\r\nThe version of JGit was updated to 4.9.0 at https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2658. \r\n\r\nHowever, this version does not support Java 7 and Travis CI test always fails now: https://travis-ci.org/kjmrknsn/zeppelin/builds/310104872\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, downgrade JGit from 4.9.0 to 4.5.4 which is the latest JGit version which supports Java 7: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that Travis CI test was passed with JGit 4.5.4: https://travis-ci.org/kjmrknsn/zeppelin/builds/310107611\r\n\r\nNow, all PRs

What is this PR for?\r\nZeppelin's interpreter setting is shared by all the users and notes, if you want to have different setting you have to create new interpreter, e.g. you can create `spark_jar1` for running spark with dependency jar1 and `spark_jar2` for running spark with dependency jar2.\r\nThis approach works, but not so convenient. `ConfInterpreter` can provide more fine-grained control on interpreter setting and more flexibility. \r\n\r\n`ConfInterpreter` is a generic interpreter that could be used by any interpreters. The input format should be property file format.\r\n\r\nIn the first paragraph, we use ConfInterpreter to make custom configuration of spark interpreter (set app name, yarn-client mode & add spark-csv dependencies). Then you can run the second paragraph which use spark-csv.\r\n\r\n![conf_interpreter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/164491/33419465-74a3fae8-d5e5-11e7-8b25-76407804d979.png)\r\n\r\nIt can be used to make custom setting for any interpreter. `ConfInterpreter` would run in the zeppelin server side, it would update the interpreter properties before you launch the interpreter process, so it needs to run before interpreter process launched. And when interpreter process is launched is determined by interpreter mode setting. So users needs to understand the interpreter mode setting of zeppelin and be aware when interpreter process is launched. E.g. If we set spark interpreter setting as isolated per note. Under this setting, each note will launch one interpreter process. In this scenario, user need to put `ConfInterpreter` as the first paragraph as the above example. Otherwise the customized setting can not be applied (The paragraph using ConfInterpreter will report ERROR).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature | Documentation]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3085\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Unit test, System test is added, also manually verified it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![conf_interpreter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/164491/33419465-74a3fae8-d5e5-11e7-8b25-76407804d979.png)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

According to the thread dump of ZeppelinServer, all of the DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker threads were waiting for the job's completion and there was no thread to launch a new job.\r\n\r\nHere is the contents of the thread dump:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-10\" #76 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007fb41d3b4000 nid=0x1b521 sleeping[0x00007fb3daef1000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native Method)\r\n        at org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.Notebook$CronJob.execute(Notebook.java:889)\r\n        at org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:202)\r\n        at org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:573)\r\n        - locked <0x00000000c0a7dbf0> (a java.lang.Object)\r\n\r\n   Locked ownable synchronizers:\r\n        - None\r\n\r\n\"DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-9\" #75 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007fb41d3b2000 nid=0x1b520 waiting on condition [0x00007fb3daff2000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native Method)\r\n        at org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.Notebook$CronJob.execute(Notebook.java:889)\r\n        at org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:202)\r\n        at org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:573)\r\n        - locked <0x00000000c0a7a470> (a java.lang.Object)\r\n\r\n   Locked ownable synchronizers:\r\n        - None\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-2\" #68 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007fb41d3c8800 nid=0x1b519 waiting on condition [0x00007fb3da473000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native Method)\r\n        at org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.Notebook$CronJob.execute(Notebook.java:889)\r\n        at org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:202)\r\n        at org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:573)\r\n        - locked <0x00000000c0a7a7b0> (a java.lang.Object)\r\n\r\n   Locked ownable synchronizers:\r\n        - None\r\n\r\n\"DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-1\" #67 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007fb41d3cc800 nid=0x1b518 waiting on condition [0x00007fb3da372000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native Method)\r\n        at org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.Notebook$CronJob.execute(Notebook.java:889)\r\n        at org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:202)\r\n        at org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:573)\r\n        - locked <0x00000000c0a7dd90> (a java.lang.Object)\r\n\r\n   Locked ownable synchronizers:\r\n        - None\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above thread dump says that all of the worker threads get stuck at https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/v0.7.3/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Notebook.java#L889.\r\n\r\nOne way to reproduce this kind of issue is creating a paragraph whose status is \"READY\" and \"disable run\". That makes the paragraph status \"READY\" permanently and `note.isTerminated()` never turns to `true`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, the following two improvements has been made at this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the unnecessary `while (!note.isTerminated()) { ... }` block because the execution of all of the paragraphs is finished after `note.runAll()`.\r\n2. Skip the cron execution if there is a running or pending paragraph. That prevents the Zeppelin cron scheduler from getting stuck by the long running paragraph whose execution duration is greater than the cron execution cycle.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3077\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Tested manually.\r\n    1. The cron scheduler does not get stuck if there is a paragraph whose status is \"READY\" and \"disable run\".\r\n    2. The following message is printed on the log file when the cron job is launched while the previous cron job still has been running.\r\n        * `execution of the cron job is skipped because there is a running or pending paragraph (note id: XXXXXXXXX)`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No.\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No.\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes. The behavior of the cron job was changed not to run if there is a running or pending paragraph by this PR. Thus, the documentation `docs/usage/other_features/cron_scheduler.md` was also added by this PR. Its layout is as follow:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"711\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-11-28 at 18 30 54\"

What is this PR for?\r\nMake the welcome header of the homepage for non login users customizable.\r\n\r\nIn our company's use case, we would like to customize the contents of the welcome header of the homepage for non login users so that we can introduce how to create an LDAP account to login Zeppelin to them.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3066\r\n\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Tested manually.\r\n    * I confirmed that the content of the HTML file whose path was set by `zeppelin.homescreen.header` was shown on the top of the home screen page.\r\n        * <img width=\"986\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-11-20 at 18 13 33\"

need update? No.\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No.\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes. `docs/setup/operation/configuration.md` was updated.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-20T09:25:57Z","updated_at":"2017-11-21T04:03:43Z","closed_at":"2017-11-21T04:03:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1085250f944d89b4d1941b2dff61c1f8d7872d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/e9db6eb89443f548d09cd4dd7245ed796d745253","head":{"label":"kjmrknsn:ZEPPELIN-3066","ref":"ZEPPELIN-3066","sha":"e9db6eb89443f548d09cd4dd7245ed796d745253","user":{"login":"kjmrknsn","id":31149688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQ5Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31149688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn","html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104719234,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQ3MTkyMzQ=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"kjmrknsn/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kjmrknsn","id":31149688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQ5Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31149688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn","html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nAdd the option which prevents paragraphs from being edited by users other than the cron executing user while their notebook is cron scheduled.\r\n\r\nNow, the cron scheduled notebook's paragraphs can be edited by users who have the \"writer\" authority. That could cause a security issue when the Hadoop cluster has data access control (managed by Apache Ranger and so forth) because the \"writer\" users can abuse the access right of the \"cron executing user\" and can access the data which they ordinary cannot access by updating the paragraphs whose notebook is cron scheduled and its cron executing user is set to other users.\r\n\r\nThus, under the circumstances strict data access control is required, it is necessary to add the option to Zeppelin, that prevents paragraphs from being edited by users other than the cron executing user while their notebook is cron scheduled.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3048\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Tested manually.\r\n    * I confirmed that when `zeppelin.notebook.cron.restrictEdit` was set to `true` and users other than the cron executing user tried to edit the paragraph whose interpreter was not on `zeppelin.notebook.cron.editableInterpreters`,  the \"Insufficient privileged\" dialog was shown and the paragraph was not updated.\r\n    * <img width=\"1184\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-11-17 at 12 31 41\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31149688/32928980-55ea34ca-cb98-11e7-9798-af36f98a99d8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No.\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No.\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes. `docs/setup/operation/configuration.md` was

Unable to use interpreter names with special characters\r\n(e.g. dash or underscore)\r\n\r\n### What is this PR for?\r\nThis fixes a regression which was introduced with ZEPPELIN-3013. There\r\nis no restriction regarding characters when creating new interpreters.\r\nBut when running a note the interpreter name was parsed using the regex\r\n%([\\w\\.]+).*, which only considered the word character class and dots.\r\nInterpreter names with special characters (e.g. _ or -) were not matched\r\ncorrectly. This change enables usage of interpreter names that use other\r\ncharacters by changing the regex group to %([^\\s\\(]+).*, which means:\r\nparse the interpreter name from % until any whitespace or open\r\nparenthesis.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n-\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3060\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCreate an interpreter with a name containing one or more special\r\ncharacters, e.g. dash or underscore. Try running that interpreter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no \r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nOn the default configuration of `conf/shiro.ini.template`, non admin users cannot restart interpreters on their notebook pages because the path `/api/interpreter/setting/restart/**` is not allowed to being accessed by non admin users.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1741\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-11-16 at 14 07 05\"

notebook pages by default, so the following line should be inserted into conf/shiro.ini.template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/api/interpreter/setting/restart/** = authc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3054\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Tested manually. I confirmed that non admin users can restart interpreters on a notebook page but still cannot access to the interpreter settings page by using `conf/shiro.ini.template`.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No.\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No.\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No.","created_at":"2017-11-16T05:34:28Z","updated_at":"2017-11-20T18:37:00Z","closed_at":"2017-11-20T18:37:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2fe5c970b7a68aff80003506288ccec8390befc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/37e736d8b8981b52e48131661c22eebfd66f0868","head":{"label":"kjmrknsn:ZEPPELIN-3054","ref":"ZEPPELIN-3054","sha":"37e736d8b8981b52e48131661c22eebfd66f0868","user":{"login":"kjmrknsn","id":31149688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQ5Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31149688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn","html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104719234,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQ3MTkyMzQ=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"kjmrknsn/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kjmrknsn","id":31149688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQ5Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31149688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn","html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nIn some deployment scenarios it is necessary to increase jetty.request.header.size, which default value is 8192. This will reduce the chance of HTTP Error 413 Request entity too large.\r\nThere should be a mechanism to configure this setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3037\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* There is an integration test (automated unit test included) for testing this feature.\r\n* To test manually, after increasing setting, make any http request to zeppelin with a request header bigger than 8K , you should not get an HTTP Error 413 Request entity too large.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-10T11:23:57Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T09:14:13Z","closed_at":"2017-11-27T00:02:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6e94eb1cab0ad4b4edce87013a4887dfddae036","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/8ff2620dd996c64d27f3ec0b2f132234f7dbc957","head":{"label":"nokia:zeppelin3037","ref":"zeppelin3037","sha":"8ff2620dd996c64d27f3ec0b2f132234f7dbc957","user":{"login":"nokia","id":341053,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM0MTA1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/341053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia","html_url":"https://github.com/nokia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85287151,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTI4NzE1MQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"nokia/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nokia","id":341053,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM0MTA1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/341053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia","html_url":"https://github.com/nokia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokia/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nokia/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nGit functionality in Zeppelin is provided by `jgit`, but it's fixed to an old version.

files need update? -- Yes, only because the license file notes the exact version of included libraries. `jgit` hasn't changed, license-wise, so it's only a matter of updating the version information\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? -- nope\r\n* Does this needs documentation? -- possibly, to let people know they get use post-commit hooks

What is this PR for?\r\nThis fixes issues when using Zeppelin with permissions for users belonging to more than one roles / groups. Constructor of org.apache.zeppelin.user.AuthenticationInfo didn't consider that the roles String will contain spaces, in case there is more than one role, e.g. 'role1, role2'.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the issue, by invoking trim() on each role.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3012\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Enable shiro.ini, including 'admin' user\r\n* Login with 'admin' and enable Interpreter Permissions for any Interpreter, granting access to 'role2'\r\n* Try to use this Interpreter with 'user1', who belongs to role2.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nfix bugs: [ZEPPELIN-3021]\r\nParagraph terminated status judgement error if it's called for a disabled paragraph with status ready. As we know the method isTerminated of  class Paragraph extends from the super class Job, it only consider the status of job\r\n\r\n```java\r\n public boolean isTerminated() {\r\n    return !this.status.isReady() && !this.status.isRunning() && !this.status.isPending();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIf we call this method in a disabled paragraph with status ready, it return false forever. If we schedule a note which have a paragraph like that, the cron job will be blocked by the code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nwhile (!note.isTerminated()) {\r\n        try {\r\n          Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n          logger.error(e.toString(), e);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nif too many cron jobs blocked by that problem, all cron jobs will be blocked because the quartz schedule thread pool is full.\r\n\r\n* overwrite metod isTerminated in class Paragraph, add disable/enable status considered, if paragraph disabled return true directly\r\n\r\n* add config null value judgement to avoid NullPointException, because when we create a paragraph the method isTerminated will be invoked in ParagraphListenerImpl.afterStatusChange before propery config initialized\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-3021](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3021)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nSchedule a note which have a disabled paragraph with status ready， test weather the cron job will get blocked by the code block mentioned above\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to be able to execute Spark notebooks on Kubernetes in cluster mode, so that the Spark Driver runs inside Kubernetes cluster - based on https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark. Zeppelin uses `spark-submit` to start RemoteInterpreterServer which is able to execute notebooks on Spark. Kubernetes specific `spark-submit` parameters like driver, executor, init container, shuffle images should be set  in SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS environment variable. In case the Spark interpreter is configured with a K8 Spark specific master url (k8s://https....) RemoteInterpreterServer is launched inside a Spark driver pod on Kubernetes, thus Zeppelin server it has to be able to connect to the remote server. In a Kubernetes cluster the best solution for this is creating a K8S service for RemoteInterpreterServer. This is the reason for having the SparkK8RemoteInterpreterManagerProcess - extending functionality of RemoteInterpreterManagerProcess - which creates the Kubernetes service, mapping the port of  RemoteInterpreterServer in Driver pod and connects to this service once Spark Driver pod is in Running state.\r\n\r\nDesign considerations: As described in `spark-interpreter-k8s.md`, the Zeppelin Server is running inside the Kubenetes cluster - thus we can choose where to run the Zeppelin server - the benefit of running the server inside K8S is that we don't have to deal with authentication. However is not enough to start only the Zeppelin Server inside the Kubernetes cluster as by default Zeppelin will start `spark-submit` in the same pod and will run every Spark job locally. The scope of this PR is run to run `spark-submit` (apache-spark-on-k8s version) properly configured with Docker images etc. so that the Spark driver will be started in a separate pod in the cluster, also staring separate pods for Spark executors  thus we can benefit from dynamic scaling of executors inside the Kubernetes cluster (while all the scheduling, pod allocation, resource management is done by the Kubernetes scheduler).\r\n\r\nPlease see below how is this running/used:\r\n\r\nThe cluster: \r\n\r\n![Spark/Zeppelin

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR introduces \"run all\" behaviour for a note in a sequential manner. The \"Run All paragraphs\" button will now run the notebook sequentially. There is a UX change as part of this PR, which is discussed below. Any suggestions to make it better are welcome.\r\nFollowing is the approach taken in brief:\r\n- Replace the behaviour of \"Run All paragraphs\" to \"Run All sequentially\"\r\n- Submit paragraphs to the respective scheduler only after the previous one completes execution (via wait-notify mechanism)\r\n- Communicate the status of the sequential run to client over websocket\r\n- Since the paragraphs won't be submitted immediately, changing their status is a challenge while keeping the code maintaining it at one place. Therefore, the approach I have taken is to keep the status of the paragrahs as-is and disallow explicit run of individual paragraphs when sequential run is in progress (see GIF for details).\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2368\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Have a notebook with different interpreter types (e.g. sh, md, spark etc.)\r\n* Click \"Run All paragraphs\"\r\n* The paragraphs should run sequentially\r\n* While sequential run is in progress, explicit run of paragraphs should not be allowed\r\n* Correct sequential run state should be communicated to the browser when note is loaded\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![sequential_run_all_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6438072/31424317-262d237a-ae77-11e7-81fe-8eda0d14c01c.gif)\r\n\r\n![sequential_run_all_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6438072/31424322-29b4a23e-ae77-11e7-80dc-b6b9d84d2624.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? Probably not, but the UX would be different\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-11T05:58:16Z","updated_at":"2017-10-30T14:23:49Z","closed_at":"2017-10-30T14:23:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32d3c148b814610452a88845d059fca20aa0fc4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/63e7e521ca82d259278e40c88764df67b1c870ff","head":{"label":"namanmishra91:ZEPPELIN-2368","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2368","sha":"63e7e521ca82d259278e40c88764df67b1c870ff","user":{"login":"namanmishra91","id":6438072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzgwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6438072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91","html_url":"https://github.com/namanmishra91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80710876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDcxMDg3Ng==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"namanmishra91/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"namanmishra91","id":6438072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzgwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6438072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91","html_url":"https://github.com/namanmishra91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/namanmishra91/zeppelin","description":"Mirror
