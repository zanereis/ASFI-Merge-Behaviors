[x] Closes #7910 \r\n- [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\nWriting the benchmark itself is not hard, but getting it right is. Thankfully, the JMH suite provides helpful annotations and features to mitigate most of them. To get started, you need to make your benchmark extend the AbstractMicrobenchmark, which makes sure the test gets run through JUnit and configures some defaults:\r\n```\r\n@BenchmarkMode({Mode.Throughput})\r\npublic class LinkedArrayBenchmark extends AbstractMicrobenchmark {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor most benchmark tests, you can write it as a normal JUnit.\r\nYou can also choose Customizing Runtime Conditions.\r\n\r\nAt present, you can run all JMH Tests by running the jar directly after packaging.\r\nBut running all JMH directly through mvn and showing that the overall report still has some problems, you can first see if it is reasonable.","created_at":"2021-10-21T16:36:33Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T09:27:26Z","closed_at":"2021-11-11T04:01:40Z","merged_at":"2021-11-11T04:01:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"4284a57501eae6df49cb2703f31cc6f30d43367e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP

\r\n\r\nEnhance OAL engine core\r\n* Fix `funcParamExpression` and `literalExpression` can't be used in the same aggregation function.\r\n* Support cast statement in the OAL core engine.\r\n* Support `(str->long)` and `(long)` for string to long cast statement.\r\n* Support `(str->int)` and `(int)` for string to int cast statement.\r\n* Support Long literal number in the OAL core engine.\r\n* Support literal `string` as parameter of aggregation function.\r\n* Add `attributeExpression` and `attributeExpressionSegment` in the OAL grammar tree to support `map` type for the\r\n  attribute expression.\r\n\r\nBesides added UTs, I locally added this OAL script\r\n```\r\nmq_consume_latency = from((str->long)Service.tag[\"transmission.latency\"]).longAvg();\r\n\r\nmq_consume_latency = from((long)Service.tag[\"transmission.latency\"]).longAvg();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn OAL debug mode(`SW_OAL_ENGINE_DEBUG=Y`), I can see this method generated in the dispatcher\r\n```java\r\n    private void doMqConsumeLatency(Service var1) {\r\n        MqConsumeLatencyMetrics var2 = new MqConsumeLatencyMetrics();\r\n        var2.setTimeBucket(var1.getTimeBucket());\r\n        var2.setEntityId(var1.getEntityId());\r\n        var2.combine(Long.parseLong(var1.getTag(\"transmission.latency\")), (long)1);\r\n        MetricsStreamProcessor.getInstance().in(var2);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother test in filter expression.\r\n```\r\nmq_consume_latency = from((str->long)Service.tag[\"transmission.latency\"]).filter((str->long)tag[\"transmission.latency\"] > 0L).longAvg();\r\n```\r\n```\r\n    private void doMqConsumeLatency(Service var1) {\r\n        if ((new GreaterMatch()).match(Long.parseLong(var1.getTag(\"transmission.latency\")), 0L)) {\r\n            MqConsumeLatencyMetrics var2 = new MqConsumeLatencyMetrics();\r\n            var2.setTimeBucket(var1.getTimeBucket());\r\n            var2.setEntityId(var1.getEntityId());\r\n

I am a participant in [Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/homepage). [Here](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/org/prodetail/210070771) is my project homepage. Now I have finished my project under the guidance of @jixuan1989 from IoTDB and @wu-sheng from Skywalking. However, I still have much work to do. This PR will help me find more bug and deficiencies of my work.\r\n\r\nI have written a [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44023810/article/details/120555823) to introduce the design of IoTDB storage plugin.\r\n\r\nThis is a large module for Skywalking. I wrote more than 5 thousand source code lines and comment lines. They contains the core code and unit tests. When I wrote the code, I took the other storage plugin as a reference.\r\n\r\nIoTDB doesn't have the index concept. In order to index some fields, I store the value of the index as a node of the storage path. Those nodes in storage path will be stored in the memory, so they serve as index. Eventually the data from the same table is spread across multiple devices. But IoTDB does not support cross-device query well. When I need use aggregation query (e.g. `max`, `avg`, `sum`), sort query (e.g. `order by`) or pagination query (e.g. `limit`, `offset`), I have to use a violence method that query all data meets the condition and then sort, aggregate or paginate them.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have run and tested this IoTDB storage plugin locally, I know it is not enough and it need e2e tests at least. Hope you review my work and give me some suggestions.\r\n\r\n- [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-22T08:06:44Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T01:04:23Z","closed_at":"2021-11-27T01:04:23Z","merged_at":"2021-11-27T01:04:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"842b5d927e9c196e14a4dc3f73812d2c4adfebf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"JaredTan95","id":12468337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDY4MzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12468337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95","html_url":"https://github.com/JaredTan95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaredTan95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP backend related."},{"id":915433204,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTU0MzMyMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/plugin","name":"plugin","color":"5a910d","default":false,"description":"Plugin for agent or collector.
