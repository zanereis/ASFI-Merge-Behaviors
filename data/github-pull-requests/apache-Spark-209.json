What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the HiveSessionImplSuite to mock instances \"before\" initializing HiveSessionImpl, to avoid possible classloader issue. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe failures of HiveSessionImplSuite always come from classloader issue. While I don't have clear idea what is happening, there's no part possibly dealing with classloader, except initializing HiveSessionImpl. We can move the mock initializations earlier than initialing HiveSessionImpl so that it can avoid possible classloader issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nVerified with multiple triggers of Jenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a simpler way  to pass 'spark.yarn.priority' through the SparkSubmit, it only works in the yarn mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe can use `--conf spark.yarn.priority` to achieve the same goal ,  but `--priority` is more simple and easy to remember by users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nEnhance `handles YARN cluster mode` and `handles YARN client mode` in `SparkSubmitSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-08T08:42:00Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T03:43:48Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T03:42:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65a25668a77dfd24dde30b80adeec526dcaf2fba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d77910ba83d2d8732a41187f0df9c6981e231e2c","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:app-priority-cmd","ref":"app-priority-cmd","sha":"d77910ba83d2d8732a41187f0df9c6981e231e2c","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch tries to mitigate the flakiness of CliSuite, via below changes:\r\n\r\n1. differentiate cli driver boot-up timeout (2 mins) and query execution timeout (parameter)\r\n\r\nCli driver boot-up is determined by master and app ID message. Given spark-sql doesn't print the message if `-e` option is specified, the patch simply add 2 mins on timeout for the case to cover the boot-up timeout.\r\n\r\n2. don't fail the test even spark-sql doesn't gracefully shut down in 1 min.\r\n\r\n3. extend timeout for `path command` test in CliSuite\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt took around 40 seconds for boot-up message (master: ... Application Id: ...) to be printed in stderr, while the overall timeout is 1 minute in many tests. This case the actual timeout for query execution is just 20 seconds, which may not be enough.\r\n\r\nSome of the tests also failed with `org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: spark-sql did not exit gracefully`, which I don't feel the test has to be failed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nVerified with multiple triggers of Jenkins

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nModify `SHOW TABLES` to support `SHOW CACHED TABLES`.\r\nAfter this pr, we can call\r\n```\r\nSHOW CACHED TABLES;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOnce we cache table in sql mode, we have no way to get it back, so that we don't know which table has cached.\r\nIf we want to reduce some cache, we have to do `clear cache` that remove all cached tables.\r\n`SHOW CACHED TABLES` can give a way to find which table is cached, then we can uncache the one we want.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new command.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2020-07-08T06:22:56Z","updated_at":"2021-04-04T00:19:13Z","closed_at":"2021-04-04T00:19:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8c2d2b525177336b7737333b9a8c1453dc9fcfd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/635d3ab5be8635e4789345480ca3bcf2f0c72cd8","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-32219","ref":"SPARK-32219","sha":"635d3ab5be8635e4789345480ca3bcf2f0c72cd8","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a giant plumbing PR that plumbs an `ExecutorDecommissionInfo` along\r\nwith the DecommissionExecutor message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation is to know whether a decommissioned executor\r\nwould also be loosing shuffle files -- and thus it is important to know\r\nwhether the host would also be decommissioned. \r\n\r\nIn the absence of this PR, the existing code assumes that decommissioning an executor does not loose the whole host with it, and thus does not clear the shuffle state if external shuffle service is enabled. While this may hold in some cases (like K8s decommissioning an executor pod, or YARN container preemption), it does not hold in others like when the cluster is managed by a Standalone Scheduler (Master). This is similar to the existing `workerLost` field in the `ExecutorProcessLost` message. \r\n\r\nIn the future, this `ExecutorDecommissionInfo` can be embellished for\r\nknowing how long the executor has to live for scenarios like Cloud spot\r\nkills (or Yarn preemption) and the like.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTweaked

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR added a physical rule to remove redundant project nodes. A `ProjectExec` is redundant when\r\n1. It has the same output attributes and order as its child's output when ordering of these attributes is required.\r\n2. It has the same output attributes as its child's output when attribute output ordering is not required.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nAfter Filter: \r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [a#14L, b#15L, c#16, key#17] \r\n+- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(a#14L) AND (a#14L > 5))\r\n   +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n      +- FileScan parquet [a#14L,b#15L,c#16,key#17] \r\n```\r\nThe `Project a#14L, b#15L, c#16, key#17` is redundant because its output is exactly the same as filter's output.\r\n\r\nBefore Aggregate:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(2) HashAggregate(keys=[key#17], functions=[sum(a#14L), last(b#15L, false)], output=[sum_a#39L, key#17, last_b#41L])\r\n+- Exchange hashpartitioning(key#17, 5), true, [id=#77]\r\n   +- *(1) HashAggregate(keys=[key#17], functions=[partial_sum(a#14L), partial_last(b#15L, false)], output=[key#17, sum#49L, last#50L, valueSet#51])\r\n      +- *(1) Project [key#17, a#14L, b#15L]\r\n         +- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(a#14L) AND (a#14L > 100))\r\n            +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n               +- FileScan parquet [a#14L,b#15L,key#17] \r\n```\r\nThe `Project key#17, a#14L, b#15L` is redundant because hash aggregate doesn't require child plan's output to be in a specific order.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt removes unnecessary query nodes and makes query plan cleaner.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an inconsistency in `EvaluatePython.makeFromJava`, which creates a type conversion function for some Java/Scala types.\r\n\r\n`other` is a type but it should actually pass `obj`:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase other => (obj: Any) => nullSafeConvert(other)(PartialFunction.empty) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not change the output because it always returns `null` for unsupported datatypes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the codes coherent, and consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo behaviour

in executor or driver\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd an optional config to determine whether the intermediate results(local TopK) of each partition in RDD.takeOrdered will be merged in driver process or executor process. If set to true, merge in driver process(by util.PriorityQueue), which will get shorter waiting time for return. But if the intermediate results are too large and too many partitions, the intermediate results may accumulate in the memory of the driver process, causing excessive memory pressure. If set to false, merge in executor process(by guava.QuickSelect), intermediate results will not accumulate in memory, but will cause longer runtimes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe problem with original implementation is that if the intermediate results are too large and too many partitions, the intermediate results may accumulate in the memory of the driver process, causing excessive memory pressure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdds configuration parameter\r\n\"spark.rdd.takeOrdered.mergeInDriver\" (default: true)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-07T19:41:28Z","updated_at":"2020-10-25T00:58:44Z","closed_at":"2020-10-25T00:58:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37ad8ab10fd1e632e39d02349f7baadb977e01a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/afacdfa37505df46116d191e7ba7d4904707e218","head":{"label":"izchen:SPARK-32212","ref":"SPARK-32212","sha":"afacdfa37505df46116d191e7ba7d4904707e218","user":{"login":"izchen","id":67534059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTM0MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67534059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen","html_url":"https://github.com/izchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":277137796,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzcxMzc3OTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"izchen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"izchen","id":67534059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTM0MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67534059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen","html_url":"https://github.com/izchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/izchen/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to deal with cosmetic variations when processing nested column extractors in `NestedColumnAliasing`. Currently if cosmetic variations are in the nested column extractors, the query is not optimized.\r\n\r\nThis backports #28988 to branch-3.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf the expressions extracting nested fields have cosmetic variations like qualifier difference, currently nested column pruning cannot work well.\r\n\r\nFor example, two attributes which are semantically the same, are referred in a query, but the nested column extractors of them are treated differently when we deal with nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixing a bug in nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-07T18:45:25Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:28:53Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T02:19:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69452189b756409fa3f82f0d80d841795ee6812b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5e4a420b13adb588d7fda4215e03cdf582ae2ac6","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-32163-3.0","ref":"SPARK-32163-3.0","sha":"5e4a420b13adb588d7fda4215e03cdf582ae2ac6","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27627 to fix the remaining issues. There are 2 issues fixed in this PR:\r\n1. `UnsafeRow.setDecimal` can set an overflowed decimal and causes an error when reading it. The expected behavior is to return null.\r\n2. The update/merge expression for decimal type in `Sum` is wrong. We shouldn't turn the `sum` value back to 0 after it becomes null due to overflow. This issue was hidden because:\r\n2.1 for hash aggregate, the buffer is unsafe row. Due to the first bug, we fail when overflow happens, so there is no chance to mistakenly turn null back to 0.\r\n2.2 for sort-based aggregate, the buffer is generic row. The decimal can overflow (the Decimal class has unlimited precision) and we don't have the null problem.\r\n\r\nIf we only fix the first bug, then the second bug is exposed and test fails. If we only fix the second bug, there is no way to test it. This PR fixes these 2 bugs together.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix issues during decimal sum when overflow happens\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Now decimal sum can return null correctly for overflow under non-ansi mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew test and updated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite` fails because the docker image contains MariaDB version `1:10.4.12+maria~bionic` but `1:10.4.13+maria~bionic` came out and `mariadb-plugin-gssapi-server` installation triggered unwanted database upgrade inside the docker image. The main problem is that the docker image scripts are prepared to handle `1:10.4.12+maria~bionic` version and not any future development.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFailing test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExecuted `MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAt the moment only the baked in JDBC connection providers can be used but there is a need to support additional databases and use-cases. In this PR I'm proposing a new developer API name `JdbcConnectionProvider`. To show how an external JDBC connection provider can be implemented I've created an example [here](https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark-jdbc-connection-provider).\r\n\r\nThe PR contains the following changes:\r\n* Added connection provider developer API\r\n* Made JDBC connection providers constructor to noarg => needed to load them w/ service loader\r\n* Connection providers are now loaded w/ service loader\r\n* Added tests to load providers independently\r\n* Moved `SecurityConfigurationLock` into a central place because other areas will change global JVM security config\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo custom authentication possibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Existing + additional unit tests\r\n* Docker integration tests\r\n* Tested manually the newly created external JDBC connection provider\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-07T12:45:03Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T16:03:22Z","closed_at":"2020-10-02T04:04:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c396e0cfa14d931ba92cace62c62f739ab0299fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/04124905187fcab366c79adc587cfe2495bff5b3","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-32001","ref":"SPARK-32001","sha":"04124905187fcab366c79adc587cfe2495bff5b3","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent the AQE skew join handling logic is very specified.\r\nIt only can handle the pattern like this (2 tables):\r\n```\r\n  SMJ\r\n     Sort\r\n       Shuffle\r\n     Sort\r\n       Shuffle\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe propose a more general skew Join pattern matching patch with less code changes.\r\nIn this patch, we can handle N-table join, join with aggregation, and so on.\r\nPS: Here, N tables SMJ will be optimized to N-1 BCJ + 1 SMJ after AE. This PR won't handle the case N SMJ after AE. I will handle it in another PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn our production user cases, we found lots of slow jobs due to data skewing even we have enabled AQE skewed join. After investigated their patterns, we found current skewed join handle logic is so specified which can satisfied less production queries. The production queries are much more complicated than this pattern.\r\n```\r\n  SMJ\r\n     Sort\r\n       Shuffle\r\n     Sort\r\n       Shuffle\r\n```\r\n\r\nA straightforward case I will introduce here:\r\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-06_at_2_55_34_PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/86734769-d6ba0800-c064-11ea-9b94-2276ceec54e5.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn above plan, there are 5 tables join case. This is not a simple case could be matched by the above pattern. But we still could see it is very similar with the pattern if we removed all the **red** boxes.\r\n\r\nFrom the stage graph, the plan is much more straightforward:\r\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-06_at_2_54_56_PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/86735373-56e06d80-c065-11ea-9b49-ba47717b9d4b.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe green boxes pattern is what we want to handle whatever red boxes exist or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe give two unit tests.\r\n\r\n1. 2 tables SMJ with aggregation, we can handle the side of skew join without agg.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screenshot_2020-07-17 test-sql-context - Details for Query 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/87742925-53de3d80-c81a-11ea-9342-4d4ca93d8961.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screenshot_2020-07-17 test-sql-context - Details for Query 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/87742971-7708ed00-c81a-11ea-8fb9-1b7e2a85986d.png)\r\n\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to disable SBT `unidoc` generation testing in Jenkins environment because it's flaky in Jenkins environment and not used for the official documentation generation. Also, GitHub Action has the correct test coverage for the official documentation generation.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28848#issuecomment-654577911 (amp-jenkins-worker-06)\r\n-

(amp-jenkins-worker-03)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark `release-build.sh` generates the official document by using the following command.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/dev/create-release/release-build.sh#L341\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nPRODUCTION=1 RELEASE_VERSION=\"$SPARK_VERSION\" jekyll build\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, this is executed by the following `unidoc` command for Scala/Java API doc.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/docs/_plugins/copy_api_dirs.rb#L30\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nsystem(\"build/sbt -Pkinesis-asl clean compile unidoc\") || raise(\"Unidoc generation failed\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the PR builder disabled `Jekyll build` and instead has a different test coverage.\r\n```python\r\n# determine if docs were changed and if we're inside the amplab environment\r\n# note - the below commented out until *all* Jenkins workers can get `jekyll` installed\r\n# if \"DOCS\" in changed_modules and test_env == \"amplab_jenkins\":\r\n#    build_spark_documentation()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding Unidoc API Documentation\r\n========================================================================\r\n[info] Building Spark unidoc using SBT with these arguments: \r\n-Phadoop-3.2 -Phive-2.3 -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl -Pkubernetes -Pmesos \r\n-Phadoop-cloud -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pkinesis-asl -Pyarn unidoc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. (This is used only for testing and not used in the official doc generation.)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins without doc generation invocation.","created_at":"2020-07-06T21:50:05Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T21:11:33Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T21:11:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ad0576526ad96a84fb8a2d488d95012c19f35af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/697130efbb89a52512a3993fcbdfb7b6808bfb92","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-DOC-GEN","ref":"SPARK-DOC-GEN","sha":"697130efbb89a52512a3993fcbdfb7b6808bfb92","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3fe3365292962fc354eb19670a4067df212d31cf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to change the HistoryServer to redirect to the history page when we access to /history without application id.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current master, status code 400 will be returned when we access to /history.\r\nSo I wonder it's better to redirect to the history page for the better UX.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. In the current master, if we access to /history without application id, we will see like the following page.\r\n![history-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/86649650-e9105380-c01c-11ea-93bb-78fd8d2e6f7b.png)\r\nAfter this change applied, we will be redirected to the history page.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test added.","created_at":"2020-07-06T21:48:09Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T20:47:10Z","closed_at":"2020-07-11T20:47:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1d5113ddc770ac7d2bd76450aabde3bf859de86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29016/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29016/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29016/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e2731f8de95560d68cc0ef24d17c318c491e8a4","head":{"label":"sarutak:history-redirect","ref":"history-redirect","sha":"7e2731f8de95560d68cc0ef24d17c318c491e8a4","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows an external agent to inform the Master that certain hosts\r\nare being decommissioned.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current decommissioning is triggered by the Worker getting getting a SIGPWR\r\n(out of band possibly by some cleanup hook), which then informs the Master\r\nabout it. This approach may not be feasible in some environments that cannot\r\ntrigger a clean up hook on the Worker. In addition, when a large number of\r\nworker nodes are being decommissioned then the master will get a flood of\r\nmessages.\r\n\r\nSo we add a new post endpoint `/workers/kill` on the MasterWebUI that allows an\r\nexternal agent to inform the master about all the nodes being decommissioned in\r\nbulk. The list of nodes is specified by providing a list of hostnames. All workers on those\r\nhosts will be decommissioned.\r\n\r\nThis API is merely a new entry point into the existing decommissioning\r\nlogic. It does not change how the decommissioning request is handled in\r\nits core.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, a new endpoint `/workers/kill` is added to the MasterWebUI. By default only\r\nrequests originating from an IP address local to the MasterWebUI are allowed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces the prospect of a job loss during decommissioning. It\r\nfixes two holes in the current decommissioning framework:\r\n\r\n- (a) Loss of decommissioned executors is not treated as a job failure:\r\nWe know that the decommissioned executor would be dying soon, so its death is\r\nclearly not caused by the application.\r\n\r\n- (b) Shuffle files on the decommissioned host are cleared when the\r\nfirst fetch failure is detected from a decommissioned host: This is a\r\nbit tricky in terms of when to clear the shuffle state ? Ideally you\r\nwant to clear it the millisecond before the shuffle service on the node\r\ndies (or the executor dies when there is no external shuffle service) --\r\ntoo soon and it could lead to some wastage and too late would lead to\r\nfetch failures.\r\n\r\n  The approach here is to do this clearing when the very first fetch\r\nfailure is observed on the decommissioned block manager, without waiting for\r\nother blocks to also signal a failure.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout them decommissioning a lot of executors at a time leads to job failures.\r\n\r\n### Code overview\r\n\r\nThe task scheduler tracks the executors that were decommissioned along with their\r\n`ExecutorDecommissionInfo`. This information is used by: (a) For handling a `ExecutorProcessLost` error, or (b) by the `DAGScheduler` when handling a fetch failure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit test `DecommissionWorkerSuite` to test the new behavior by exercising the Master-Worker decommissioning. I chose to add a new test since the setup logic was quite different from the existing `WorkerDecommissionSuite`. I am open to changing the name of the newly added test suite :-) \r\n\r\n### Questions for reviewers\r\n- Should I add a feature flag to guard these two behaviors ? They seem safe to me that they should only get triggered by decommissioning, but you never know

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen somebody changed the type of partition's field, spark will throw ClassCastException. For example, we have a table like this:\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists cast_exception_test;\r\n\r\ncreate table cast_exception_test(c1 int, c2 string) partitioned by (dt string) stored as orc;\r\n\r\ninsert into table cast_exception_test partition(dt='2020-04-08') values('1', 'jeff_1');\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you change the field's type in hive, query the old partition, spark will throw ClassCastException, but hive will not:\r\n```\r\n-- change the field's type using hive\r\nalter table cast_exception_test change column c1 c1 string;\r\n-- hive correct,  but spark throws ClassCastException\r\nselect * from cast_exception_test where dt='2020-04-08';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the table has many fields, we don's known which field has been changed. If we print out log about this exception, it will very helpful for us to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the ClassCastException is caused by changed field's type, you can search which field has problem in exexutor logs:\r\n```\r\n20/04/09 17:22:05 ERROR hive.HadoopTableReader: Exception thrown in field <c1>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nFirst, prepare the test data, the table is partitioned and stored as orc:\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists cast_exception_test;\r\ncreate table cast_exception_test(c1 int, c2 string) partitioned by (dt string) stored as orc;\r\ninsert into table cast_exception_test partition(dt='2020-04-08') values('1', 'jeff_1');\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThen, change the field's type in hive. \r\n```\r\nalter table cast_exception_test change column c1 c1 string;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the metadata of the table has been modified, but the partition's metadata which is stored in orc file or hive metastore's mysql is still old. So, query command throws ClassCastException in spark, because spark use table's metadata which is different from orc file's metadata. But hive use partition's metadata which is the same as orc file's metadata.\r\n\r\nIf you query the old partition, spark will thrown ClassCastException, but hive will not:\r\n```\r\nselect * from cast_exception_test where dt='2020-04-08';\r\n```","created_at":"2020-07-06T10:28:35Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T14:34:02Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T14:34:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2b595cb521800c7a55c94cde8271a96983a687b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29010/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29010/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29010/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/018c98180afd105c92e3f616121627711dd5336c","head":{"label":"StefanXiepj:SPARK-32192","ref":"SPARK-32192","sha":"018c98180afd105c92e3f616121627711dd5336c","user":{"login":"StefanXiepj","id":26733114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzMzMTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26733114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanXiepj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":272186674,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzIxODY2NzQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"StefanXiepj/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"StefanXiepj","id":26733114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzMzMTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26733114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanXiepj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanXiepj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/StefanXiepj/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the order between initialization for ExecutorPlugin and starting heartbeat thread in Executor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current master, heartbeat thread in a executor starts after plugin initialization so if the initialization takes long time, heartbeat is not sent to driver and the executor will be removed from cluster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Plugins for executors will be allowed to take long time for initialization. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen using dynamic partition overwrite, each task has its working dir under staging dir like `stagingDir/.spark-staging-{jobId}`, each task commits to `outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}/{partitionId}/part-{taskId}-{jobId}{ext}`.\r\nWhen speculation enable, multiple task attempts would be setup for one task, **they have same task id and they would commit to same file concurrently**. Due to host done or node preemption, the partly-committed files aren't cleaned up, a FileAlreadyExistsException would be raised in this situation, resulting in job failure.\r\n\r\nI don't try to change task commit process for dynamic partition overwrite, like adding attempt id to task working dir for each attempts and committing to final output dir via a new outputCommitCoordinator, here is reason:\r\n\r\n1. `FileOutputCommitter` already has commit coordinator for each task attempts, we can leverage it rather than build a new one.\r\n2. To say the least, we implement a coordinator solving task attempts commit conflict, suppose a severe case, application master failover, tasks with same attempt id and same task id would commit to same files, the `FileAlreadyExistsException` risk still exists\r\n\r\nIn this pr, I leverage FileOutputCommitter to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n1. when initing a write job description, set `outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}` as the output dir\r\n2. each task attempt writes output to `outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}/_temporary/${appAttemptId}/_temporary/${taskAttemptId}/{partitionId}/part-{taskId}-{jobId}{ext}`\r\n3. leverage `FileOutputCommitter` coordinator, write job firstly commits output to `outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}/{partitionId}`\r\n4. for dynamic partition overwrite, write job finally move `outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}/{partitionId}` to `outputPath/{partitionId}`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout this pr, dynamic partition overwrite would fail\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplace the combination of expressions `SecondsToTimestamp` and `UnixTimestamp` by `GetTimestamp` in `ParseToDate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEliminate unnecessary parsing overhead in: **string -> timestamp -> long (seconds) -> timestamp -> date**. After the changes, the chain will be: **string -> timestamp -> date**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites such as `DateFunctionsSuite`.","created_at":"2020-07-05T19:42:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:27:05Z","closed_at":"2020-07-07T14:26:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6aee6b2920de85279eaf3ade931dc08828a0dcf8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/87a3752e8c93240231e00deea467e63a915ce17a","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:ParseToDate-parse-timestamp","ref":"ParseToDate-parse-timestamp","sha":"87a3752e8c93240231e00deea467e63a915ce17a","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n Improve the speculation for the inefficient tasks by the task metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1) Tasks will be speculated when meet certain conditions no matter they are inefficient or not，this would be a huge waste of cluster resources.\r\n2) In production, the speculation task comes  from an efficient one  will be killed finally, which is unnecessary and wastes the cluster resources. Sometimes, it interferes with other task scheduling.\r\n3) So, we should  evaluate whether the task is inefficient by success tasks metrics firstly,  and then decide to speculate it or not. The  inefficient task should be speculated and the efficient one should not, it is better for the cluster resources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen converting an `INSERT OVERWRITE` query to a v2 overwrite plan, Spark attempts to detect when a dynamic overwrite and a static overwrite will produce the same result so it can use the static overwrite. Spark incorrectly detects when dynamic and static overwrites are equivalent when there are hidden partitions, such as `days(ts)`.\r\n\r\nThis updates the analyzer rule `ResolveInsertInto` to always use a dynamic overwrite when the mode is dynamic, and static when the mode is static. This avoids the problem by not trying to determine whether the two plans are equivalent and always using the one that corresponds to the partition overwrite mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a correctness bug. If a table has hidden partitions, all of the values for those partitions are dropped instead of dynamically overwriting changed partitions.\r\n\r\nThis only affects SQL commands (not `DataFrameWriter`) writing to tables that have hidden partitions. It is also only a problem when the partition overwrite mode is dynamic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it fixes the correctness bug detailed above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* This updates the in-memory table to support a hidden partition transform, `days`, and adds a test case to `DataSourceV2SQLSuite` in which the table uses this hidden partition function. This test fails without the fix to `ResolveInsertInto`.\r\n* This updates the test case `InsertInto: overwrite - multiple static partitions - dynamic mode` in `InsertIntoTests`. The result of the SQL command is unchanged, but the SQL command will now use a dynamic overwrite so the test now uses

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\nSupport query auto cancelling when running too long on thriftserver.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor dynamic partition overwrite, its working dir is `.spark-staging-{jobId}`.\r\nTask file name formatted `part-$taskId-$jobId$ext`(regardless task attempt Id).\r\nEach task writes its output to:\r\n\r\n- `.spark-staging-{jobId}/partitionPath1/taskFileName1`\r\n- `.spark-staging-{jobId}/partitionPath2/taskFileName2`\r\n- ...\r\n- `.spark-staging-{jobId}/partitionPathN/taskFileNameN`\r\n\r\nIf speculation is enabled, there may be several tasks, which have same taskId and different attemptId, write to the same files concurrently.\r\nFor distributedFileSystem, it only allow one task to hold the lease to write a file, if two tasks want to write the same file, an exception like `no lease on inode` would be thrown.\r\n\r\nEven speculation is not enabled, if a task aborted due to Executor OOM, its output would not be cleaned up.\r\nThen a new task launched to write the same file, because parquet disallows overwriting, a `FileAlreadyExistsException` would be thrown, like.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileAlreadyExistsException:

failed.\r\n\r\nIn this Pr, we define a spark staging output committer to fix this issue:\r\n1. set a working path under staging dir named partitionPath-attemptId.\r\n2. after task completed, rename partitionPath-attemptId/fileName to partitionPath/fileName\r\n3. leverage the OutputCommitCoordinator to coordinate the task commits\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, dynamic partition overwrite operation might fail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-03T03:04:38Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T02:52:43Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T02:52:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5472e6e4ec97042599ef267305d220112ecb3bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d722a9de6becb493bff7e0f1c6395b337ac0d7f","head":{"label":"turboFei:SPARK-27194-custom-committer","ref":"SPARK-27194-custom-committer","sha":"0d722a9de6becb493bff7e0f1c6395b337ac0d7f","user":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77131854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzEzMTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"turboFei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to deal with cosmetic variations when processing nested column extractors in `NestedColumnAliasing`. Currently if cosmetic variations are in the nested column extractors, the query is not optimized.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf the expressions extracting nested fields have cosmetic variations like qualifier difference, currently nested column pruning cannot work well.\r\n\r\nFor example, two attributes which are semantically the same, are referred in a query, but the nested column extractors of them are treated differently when we deal with nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixing a bug in nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-03T02:19:11Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:28:52Z","closed_at":"2020-07-07T18:18:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"105f817ef041cb381ebb050f30714ecbfa8b80e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d352dbcdecfbdab08607c2416748e7650294fa42","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-32163","ref":"SPARK-32163","sha":"d352dbcdecfbdab08607c2416748e7650294fa42","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to disallow to create `SparkContext` in executors, e.g., in UDFs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently executors can create SparkContext, but shouldn't be able to create it.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsc.range(0, 1).foreach { _ =>\r\n  new SparkContext(new SparkConf().setAppName(\"test\").setMaster(\"local\"))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users won't be able to create `SparkContext` in

tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-02T23:32:06Z","updated_at":"2020-07-30T05:31:00Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T06:52:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e11a947fdd40cfee2ba8c338a1d9d39a48a7e0d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28986/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28986/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28986/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0faac2a4495bebc67819122d7a2d23a750c71ddd","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-32160/disallow_spark_context_in_executors","ref":"issues/SPARK-32160/disallow_spark_context_in_executors","sha":"0faac2a4495bebc67819122d7a2d23a750c71ddd","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a backport of changes from SPARK-25262, PR #22323\r\n\r\nI plan to also backport SPARK-28042, PR #24879 after this is landed. That diff will also include a test confirming that related issue [SPARK-31666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31666) is fixed.\r\n\r\nI had originally submitted both as a single PR, but have decided to close that PR and open 2 smaller ones per the recommendation of @dongjoon-hyun . See #28982 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRunning Spark on Kubernetes and not being able to use mounted volumes as local storage causes issues that prevent Spark jobs from starting. I've seen this on AWS EKS, but I've been able to reproduce it with a basic spark-submit command on a standard K8S cluster. Upgrading to 3.0 just to fix this bug is more hassle than it's worth for some organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nTechnically, yes. This adds the spark.kubernetes.local.dirs.tmpfs back to Spark 2.4 from Spark 3. However, there's no \"breaking changes\" per se.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe tests were backported. Also, we've been running our own custom Spark 2.4.5 build with this patch applied at my org for the past few months.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-02T21:55:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T15:18:32Z","closed_at":"2020-07-06T15:18:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6a08bc77f75c46fb0464067aa9e217ea3364201","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28985/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28985/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28985/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2710ae3a34f8dd2246f539e0fd12dd2ed1c02c5c","head":{"label":"hopper-signifyd:SPARK-25262-2.4","ref":"SPARK-25262-2.4","sha":"2710ae3a34f8dd2246f539e0fd12dd2ed1c02c5c","user":{"login":"hopper-signifyd","id":50119450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTE5NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50119450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd","html_url":"https://github.com/hopper-signifyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":276730691,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzY3MzA2OTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"hopper-signifyd/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hopper-signifyd","id":50119450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTE5NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50119450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd","html_url":"https://github.com/hopper-signifyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopper-signifyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hopper-signifyd/spark","description":"Apache

The fix for SPARK-27296 introduced by #25024 allows `Aggregator` objects to appear in queries. This works fine for aggregators with atomic input types, e.g. `Aggregator[Double, _, _]`. \r\n\r\nHowever it can cause a null pointer exception if the input type is `Array[_]`.  This was historically considered an ignorable case for serialization of `UnresolvedMapObjects`, but the new ScalaAggregator class causes these expressions to be serialized over to executors because the resolve-and-bind is being deferred.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA new rule `ResolveEncodersInScalaAgg` that performs the resolution of the expressions contained in the encoders so that properly resolved expressions are serialized over to executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nApplying an aggregator of the form `Aggregator[Array[_], _, _]` using `functions.udaf()` currently causes a null pointer error in Catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA unit test has been added that does aggregation with array types for input, buffer, and output.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe should backport the fixes for local dirs on Kubernetes to Spark 2.4. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRunning Spark on Kubernetes and not being able to use mounted NVME drives as local storage causes issues on services such as AWS EKS. Upgrading to 3.0 just to fix this bug is more hassle than it's worth for some organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nTechnically, yes. This adds the `spark.kubernetes.local.dirs.tmpfs` back to Spark 2.4 from Spark 3.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `ExpressionEncoder` for the return type of ScalaUDF to convert to the catalyst type, instead of using `CatalystTypeConverters`. \r\n\r\nNote, this change only takes effect for typed Scala UDF since its the only case where we know the type tag of the raw type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsers now could register a UDF with `Instant`/`LocalDate` as return types even with `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled=false`. However, the UDF can not really be used.\r\nFor example, if we try:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"set spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled=false\")\r\nscala> spark.udf.register(\"buildDate\", udf{ d: String => java.time.LocalDate.parse(d) })\r\nscala> Seq(\"2020-07-02\").toDF(\"d\").selectExpr(\"CAST(buildDate(d) AS STRING)\").show\r\n```\r\nThen, we will hit the error:\r\n```scala\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: java.time.LocalDate cannot be cast to java.sql.Date\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.CatalystTypeConverters$DateConverter$.toCatalystImpl(CatalystTypeConverters.scala:304)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.CatalystTypeConverters$CatalystTypeConverter.toCatalyst(CatalystTypeConverters.scala:107)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.CatalystTypeConverters$.$anonfun$createToCatalystConverter$2(CatalystTypeConverters.scala:425)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ScalaUDF.eval(ScalaUDF.scala:1169)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nas it actually requires enabling `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` when using the UDF. And I think this could make users get confused.\r\n\r\nThis happens because when registering the UDF,  Spark actually uses `ExpressionEncoder` to ser/deser types. However, when using UDF, Spark uses `CatalystTypeConverters`, which is under control of `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled`, to ser/deser types. Therefore, Spark would fail to convert the Java8 date time types.\r\n\r\nIf we could also use `ExpressionEncoder` to ser/deser types for the return type, similar to what we do for the input parameter types, then, UDF could support Instant/LocalDate, event other combined complex types as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Before this PR, if users run the demo above, they would hit the error. After this PR, the demo will run successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor queries like `t1d in (SELECT t2d FROM  t2 ORDER  BY t2c LIMIT 2)`, the result can be non-deterministic as the result of the subquery may output different results (it's not sorted by `t2d` and it has shuffle).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the test more robust by sorting the output column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid flaky test\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nN/A","created_at":"2020-07-02T07:16:50Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T12:15:04Z","closed_at":"2020-07-02T12:04:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebc2aef098b9de664d4475c523f8fc347549b0b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/750522ba0df7d0573b20d8ca317eebc9e7165fb1","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:small","ref":"small","sha":"750522ba0df7d0573b20d8ca317eebc9e7165fb1","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the odd join result being occurred from stream-stream join for state store format V2.\r\n\r\nThere're some spots on V2 path which leverage UnsafeProjection. As the result row is reused, the row should be copied to avoid changing value during reading (or make sure the caller doesn't affect by such behavior) but `SymmetricHashJoinStateManager.removeByValueCondition` violates the case.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes `KeyWithIndexToValueRowConverterV2.convertValue` copy the row by itself so that callers don't need to take care about it. This patch doesn't change the behavior of `KeyWithIndexToValueRowConverterV2.convertToValueRow` to avoid double-copying, as the caller is expected to store the row which the implementation of state store will call `copy()`.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds such behavior into each method doc in `KeyWithIndexToValueRowConverter`, so that further contributors can read through and make sure the change / new addition doesn't break the contract.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nStream-stream join with state store format V2 (newly added in Spark 3.0.0) has a serious correctness bug which brings indeterministic result.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, some of Spark 3.0.0 users using stream-stream join from the new checkpoint (as the bug exists to only v2 format path) may encounter wrong join result. This patch will fix it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nReported case is converted to the new UT, and confirmed UT passed. All UTs in StreamingInnerJoinSuite and StreamingOuterJoinSuite passed as well","created_at":"2020-07-02T06:01:50Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T10:40:28Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T07:37:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d069156417aa3b1691cd7f76c01dd629286b3ebd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nbackport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28948\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28760 to fix the remaining issues:\r\n1. should consider data source options when refreshing cache by path at the end of `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`\r\n2. should consider data source options when inferring schema for file source\r\n3. should consider data source options when getting the qualified path in file source v2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe didn't catch these issues in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28760, because the test case is to check error when initializing the file system. If we initialize the file system multiple times during a simple read/write action, the test case actually only test the first time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nrewrite the test to make sure the entire data source read/write action can succeed.","created_at":"2020-07-02T04:04:11Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T10:46:35Z","closed_at":"2020-07-02T10:46:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63866c703e19646264f37c4f38f75400b45198ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1fe95be9b32bacb8198007544a1cc1b197f20786","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:pick","ref":"pick","sha":"1fe95be9b32bacb8198007544a1cc1b197f20786","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to partly resolve SPARK-29292, and fully resolve SPARK-30010, which should allow Spark to compile vs Scala 2.13 in Spark Core and up through GraphX (not SQL, Streaming, etc).\r\n\r\nNote that we are not trying to determine here whether this makes Spark work on 2.13 yet, just compile, as a prerequisite for assessing test outcomes. However, of course, we need to ensure that the change does not break 2.12.\r\n\r\nThe changes are, in the main, adding .toSeq and .toMap calls where mutable collections / maps are returned as Seq / Map, which are immutable by default in Scala 2.13. The theory is that it should be a no-op for Scala 2.12 (these return themselves), and required for 2.13.\r\n\r\nThere are a few non-trivial changes highlighted below.\r\nIn particular, to get Core to compile, we need to resolve SPARK-30010 which removes a deprecated SparkConf method\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nEventually, we need to support a Scala 2.13 build, perhaps in Spark 3.1. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, removal of the deprecated SparkConf.setAll overload, which isn't legal in Scala 2.13 anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. (2.13 was not _tested_; this is about getting it to compile without breaking

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n\r\n1. To introduce `InheritableThread` class, that works identically with `threading.Thread` but it can inherit the inheritable attributes of a JVM thread such as `InheritableThreadLocal`.\r\n\r\n    This was a problem from the pinned thread mode, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24898. Now it works as below:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    import pyspark\r\n\r\n    spark.sparkContext.setLocalProperty(\"a\", \"hi\")\r\n    def print_prop():\r\n        print(spark.sparkContext.getLocalProperty(\"a\"))\r\n\r\n    pyspark.InheritableThread(target=print_prop).start()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    hi\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Also, it adds the resource leak fix into `InheritableThread`. Py4J leaks the thread and does not close the connection from Python to JVM. In `InheritableThread`, it manually closes the connections when PVM garbage collection happens. So, JVM threads finish safely. I manually verified by profiling but there's also another easy way to verify:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD=true ./bin/pyspark\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    >>> from threading import Thread\r\n    >>> Thread(target=lambda: spark.range(1000).collect()).start()\r\n    >>> Thread(target=lambda: spark.range(1000).collect()).start()\r\n    >>> Thread(target=lambda: spark.range(1000).collect()).start()\r\n    >>> spark._jvm._gateway_client.deque\r\n    deque([<py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119f7aba8>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119fc9b70>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119fc9e10>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x11a015358>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119fc00f0>])\r\n    >>> Thread(target=lambda: spark.range(1000).collect()).start()\r\n    >>> spark._jvm._gateway_client.deque\r\n    deque([<py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119f7aba8>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119fc9b70>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119fc9e10>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x11a015358>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119fc08d0>, <py4j.clientserver.ClientServerConnection object at 0x119fc00f0>])\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This issue is fixed now.\r\n\r\n3. Because now we have a fix for the issue here, it also proposes to deprecate `collectWithJobGroup` which was a temporary workaround added to avoid this leak issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support pinned thread mode properly without a resource leak, and a proper inheritable local properties.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds an API `InheritableThread` class for pinned thread mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as described above, and unit test was added as well.","created_at":"2020-07-01T15:09:47Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:06:09Z","closed_at":"2020-07-30T01:15:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71410245561d77557110d8947ac9fc2cfcf50336","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a78fd4314ba39d1feb63ba1539ac9a2acf40de77","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32010","ref":"SPARK-32010","sha":"a78fd4314ba39d1feb63ba1539ac9a2acf40de77","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImproving file path name normalisation by removing the approximate transformation from Spark and using the path normalization from the JDK.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the external shuffle service during the block resolution the file paths (for disk persisted RDD and for shuffle blocks) are normalized by a custom Spark code which uses an OS dependent regexp. This is a redundant code of the package-private JDK counterpart. As the code not a perfect match even it could happen one method results in a bit different (but semantically equal) path. \r\n\r\nThe reason of this redundant transformation is the interning of the normalized path to save some heap here which is only possible if both transformations results in the same string.\r\n\r\nChecking the JDK code I believe there is a better solution which is perfect match for the JDK code as it uses that package private method. Moreover based on some benchmarking even this new method seams to be more performant too. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAs we are reusing the JDK code for normalisation no test is needed. Even the existing test can be removed.\r\n\r\nBut in a separate branch I have created a benchmark where the performance of the old and the new solution can be compared. It shows the new method is about 7-10 times better than old one.","created_at":"2020-07-01T15:07:39Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T13:56:36Z","closed_at":"2020-07-11T13:55:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd738f3f6fe294483b40caf3437a340bb40dc1b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28967/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28967/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28967/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e7657cd33d3f3544e0b12e81f2742be0e6b5073e","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-32149","ref":"SPARK-32149","sha":"e7657cd33d3f3544e0b12e81f2742be0e6b5073e","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRetain `EXTERNAL` property in table properties so that we can get it through `CatalogTable`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHive support alter `EXTERNAL` using `alter table tbl set tblproperties('EXTERNAL'='true')`, the result is a managed table can be changed to an external table. Unfortunately spark excluded this property then we cann't get the `EXTERNAL` property.\r\n\r\nNote that, hive change table type to EXTERNAL when value is `TRUE`, and not change table type but keep EXTERNAL behavior when value ignoreCaseEqual `true`. Below is all case, and we make error at case 2.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    // We should match case 2\r\n    // 1. MANAGED && TRUE => EXTERNAL\r\n    // 2. MANAGED && true => MANAGED (EXTERNAL behavior)\r\n    // 3. MANAGED && FALSE => MANAGED\r\n    // 4. MANAGED && false => MANAGED\r\n    // 5. EXTERNAL && TRUE => EXTERNAL\r\n    // 6. EXTERNAL && true => MANAGED\r\n    // 7. EXTERNAL && FALSE => MANAGED\r\n    // 8. EXTERNAL && false => MANAGED\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherhand, it is a bug. Try this step to reproduce:\r\n1. create a managed table t1.\r\n2. use hive client `set tblproperties('EXTERNAL'='true')` (if we drop table t1 here, data will not be deleted.)\r\n3. use spark `set tblproperties('k'='v')`\r\n4. `drop table t1` will drop data since t1 tblproperties will not contains `EXTERNAL`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, if `EXTERNAL` is useful user can get it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29283, we only show the error message of root cause to end-users through JDBC client. In some cases, it erases the straightaway messages that we intentionally make to help them for better understanding.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is somehow obscure for JDBC end-users who only writing SQL queries.\r\n\r\ne.g\r\n```\r\nError running query: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: The second argument of 'date_sub' function needs to be an integer.;\r\n```\r\n\r\nis better than just\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: invalid input syntax for type numeric: 1.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should do as Hive does in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14368\r\n\r\nIn general, this PR partially reverts SPARK-29283, ports HIVE-14368, and improves test coverage\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Do the same as Hive 2.3 and later for getting an error message in ThriftCLIService.GetOperationStatus\r\n2. The root cause is somehow obscure for JDBC end-users who only writing SQL queries. \r\n3. Consistency with `spark-sql` script\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, when running queries using thrift server and an error occurs, you will get the full stack traces instead of only the message of the root cause\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a configuration `spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.maxPartitionSplits` to prevent a skewed join from producing too many partition splits.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn handling skewed SortMergeJoin, when matching partitions from the left side and the right side both have skew and split too many partitions, the plan generation may take a very long time and finally OOM.\r\n\r\nEven fallback to normal SMJ, the query cannot success either. So we should fast fail this query.\r\n\r\nIn below logs we can see that it took over 1 hour to generate the plan in AQE when handle a skewed join which produced too many splits.\r\n```\r\n20/06/30

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to drop Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, it removes all the widely known Python 2 compatibility workarounds such as `sys.version` comparison, `__future__`. Also, it removes the Python 2 dedicated codes such as `ArrayConstructor` in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n 1. Unsupport EOL Python versions\r\n 2. Reduce maintenance overhead and remove a bit of legacy codes and hacks for Python 2.\r\n 3. PyPy2 has a critical bug that causes a flaky test, SPARK-28358 given my testing and investigation. \r\n 4. Users can use Python type hints with Pandas UDFs without thinking about Python version\r\n 5. Users can leverage one latest cloudpickle, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28950. With Python 3.8+ it can also leverage C pickle.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users cannot use Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 in the upcoming Spark version.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and also tested in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs suggested by @cloud-fan in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28916#issuecomment-651527077, apply `CoalesceShufflePartitions` with partitionSpecs of `Nil` when `ShuffleQueryStageExec#mapStats` is None.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor SQL like\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT b, COUNT(t1.a) as cnt\r\nFROM t1\r\nINNER JOIN t2\r\nON t1.id = t2.id\r\nWHERE t1.id > 10\r\nGROUP BY b\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen all ids of t1 are smaller than 10. Many unnecessary tasks are launched for the final shuffle stage because `CoalesceShufflePartitions` is skipped when input RDD has 0 partitions.\r\n\r\n#### Before

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request is to support query execution before reading DataFrame and after reading/writing DataFrame over JDBC.\r\nThere are two new options; `preActions` and `postActions` in DataFrame's JDBC configuration.\r\n\r\nSQL statements specified in `preActions` will be executed before reading/writing DataFrame via JDBC.\r\nSQL statements specified in `postActions` will be executed after writing DataFrame via JDBC.\r\n\r\nNote: `postActions` is only supported in JDBC writer, not in JDBC reader. It is because it won't be needed so often and I was not able to find good places to implement this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor ETL workload, there is a common requirement to perform SQL statement before/after reading/writing over JDBC.\r\nHere's examples;\r\n- Create a view with specific conditions\r\n- Delete/Update some records\r\n- Truncate a table (it is already possible in `truncate` option)\r\n- Execute stored procedure (it is also requested in SPARK-32014)\r\n\r\nSee details in the JIRA. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32013\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nWith this feature, users can run any SQL statements before/after reading/writing DataFrame over JDBC.\r\n\r\n#### How to use it\r\nHere's two examples which describes how to use the new options.\r\n\r\n* Read\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n      .option(\"url\", \"jdbc:someUrl\")\r\n      .option(\"dbtable\", \"TEST.PEOPLE\")\r\n      .option(\"preActions\", \"delete from test.people where name = 'fred'\")\r\n      .load()\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Write\r\n```\r\n    df.write.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n      .option(\"url\", \"jdbc:someUrl\")\r\n      .option(\"dbtable\", \"TEST.CUSTOMQUERY\")\r\n      .option(\"postActions\", \"insert into TEST.CUSTOMQUERY values ('fred', 1)\")\r\n      .options(properties.asScala)\r\n      .save()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does not affect any existing behavior. It just adds new options to use this new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added test cases into `JDBCSuite.scala` and `JDBCWriteSuite.scala`, and confirmed all the tests have been passed.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-30T01:23:04Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T13:54:07Z","closed_at":"2021-04-06T00:28:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb9b5e67c2606963acda2995ba76f586fa43535b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3244c301914219abc8721ab23c224ca99f64fbbd","head":{"label":"moomindani:SPARK-32013","ref":"SPARK-32013","sha":"3244c301914219abc8721ab23c224ca99f64fbbd","user":{"login":"moomindani","id":1304020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1304020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani","html_url":"https://github.com/moomindani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73681173,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzY4MTE3Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"moomindani/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"moomindani","id":1304020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1304020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani","html_url":"https://github.com/moomindani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moomindani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/moomindani/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs the followup of #28900, this patch extends coalescing partitions to repartitioning using hints and SQL syntax without specifying number of partitions, when AQE is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen repartitionning using hints and SQL syntax, we should follow the shuffling behavior of repartition by expression/range to coalesce partitions when AQE is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. After this change, if users don't specify the number of partitions when repartitioning using `REPARTITION`/`REPARTITION_BY_RANGE` hint or `DISTRIBUTE BY`/`CLUSTER BY`, AQE will coalesce partitions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2020-06-30T00:03:32Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:28:50Z","closed_at":"2020-07-01T23:15:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"142d0d244fd63879a24443ccef4272ff7b35c80b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/97788244abe1d24932276895e1a5064e45228e42","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-32056-sql","ref":"SPARK-32056-sql","sha":"97788244abe1d24932276895e1a5064e45228e42","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate cloudpickle in PySpark to cloudpickle v1.4.1 (See https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/blob/v1.4.1/cloudpickle/cloudpickle.py)\r\n\r\nThis is currently the highest version of cloudpickle, and it does not support Python 2.\r\n\r\nPort cloudpickle_fast.py to leverage C pickle in Python 3.8+ (See https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/blob/v1.4.1/cloudpickle/cloudpickle_fast.py)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPySpark's cloudpickle.py and versions of cloudpickle below 1.3.0 interfere with dill unpickling because they define types.ClassType, which is undefined in dill. This results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/apache_beam/internal/pickler.py\", line 279, in loads\r\n

return _reverse_typemap[name]\r\nKeyError: 'ClassType'\r\n```\r\n(See https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/82)\r\n\r\nThis was fixed for cloudpickle 1.3.0+ (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/337), but PySpark's cloudpickle.py doesn't have this change yet.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n`python/run-tests`\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-29T16:39:37Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T01:39:45Z","closed_at":"2020-07-15T01:16:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55d1a7b3629eae1b3175aeaba346b61fded6ac6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28760 to fix the remaining issues:\r\n1. should consider data source options when refreshing cache by path at the end of `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`\r\n2. should consider data source options when inferring schema for file source\r\n3. should consider data source options when getting the qualified path in file source v2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe didn't catch these issues in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28760, because the test case is to check error when initializing the file system. If we initialize the file system multiple times during a simple read/write action, the test case actually only test the first time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nrewrite the test to make sure the entire data source read/write action can

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the `apply` method of `OptimizeSkewedJoin`, we first match out the `UnionExec` nodes, then try to optimize their children with current logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent, the AQE skew join only supports two tables join such as\r\n```\r\nSMJ\r\n:-Sort\r\n:    +-Shuffle\r\n+-Sort\r\n     +-Shuffle\r\n```\r\nBut if the plan contains a Union, the skew join handling not work:\r\n```\r\nUnion\r\n:-SMJ\r\n:   :-Sort\r\n:   :    +-Shuffle\r\n:   +-Sort\r\n:        +-Shuffle\r\n+-SMJ\r\n:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1.Use local timezone instead of server side session timezone to show `Date`.\r\n2.Add a unit test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsers may need to get a unify date result in client side.\r\nBefore this patch, people will get different result from `df.toPandas()` and `df.collect()` as follows：\r\n>>> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\",\"UTC\")\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(\"2018-06-01 01:00:00\",)], [\"ts\"])\r\n>>> df = df.withColumn(\"ts\",

print(df.collect()[0][0])\r\n2018-06-01 09:00:00\r\n(tips: Client side timezone is UTC+8)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes，\r\nUsers will follow local timezone as
