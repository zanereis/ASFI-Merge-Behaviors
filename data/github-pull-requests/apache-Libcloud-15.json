to improve the `GCENodeImage` coverage of the GCE API.  Specifically, this update has:\n- Added object attributes to match the upstream Image resource (e.g. `diskSizeGb`, `sourceType`, etc)\n- Moving toward deprecating older attributes such as `preferredKernel`. This has long been removed from the GCE API, but there is a chance very old customer images still retain this value.\n- Add support for setting timestamps for deprecating images for when they would will be automatically marked as `DELETED`, `OBSOLETE`, and `DEPRECATED`.\n- Also adding a nice-to-have feature for allowing users to specify a search-list of projects versus just the user's project and hard-coded list of supported image projects.\n\nNo breaking changes introduced and tests have been enhanced for these

GCE DiskTypes[1] support - part 1.\n\nThe GCE driver fakes support for DiskTypes at the moment and relies on a string `pd-ssd` or `pd-standard` for users to select the disktype. This PR sets the ground work to add GCE native DiskTypes that will be easier to expand in the future. For instance, Google has already introduced a `local-ssd` option.\n\nI opted to split this up into two PRs so that this one only introduces a new libcloud object and does not tinker with existing \"fake\" disk-types.  Part 2 will be a follow-up to this one to update existing use of the string-version option and also allow using the new GCEDiskType object.\n\n[1]

PR provides support for authorizing requests from within GCE directly by pulling an authorization token out of GCE's internal metadata services.  This greatly simplifies using libcloud inside GCE since it does not require the user to copy around private auth files.  The only parameter required for this method is the user's Project ID.  See the included docs for a sample use-case.\n\nThis PR also attempts to address https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-607 by appending the Project ID to the cached credential

support for user-defined Service Account scopes when creating nodes in the GCE driver.  The default for this new paramter is modeled after both the Google Developers Console and Cloud SDK and sets an instance's (node's) default serviceAccount to,\n\n```\n[{'email': 'default',\n'scopes': ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only']\n}]\n```\n\nTo better match Google tools, short-name aliases as documented in Cloud SDK's `gcloud compute instances create --help` are supported.\n\nTypical usage would likely just use the 'default' email for the Service Account but allow overriding the list of scopes.  For example,\n\n```\nex_service_accounts = [{'scopes': ['bigquery','compute-ro', 'pubsub']}]\n```\n\nWill map to,\n\n```\n[{'email': 'default',\n'scopes': [\n

was trying to do the following using apache-libcloud==0.15.1 on Python 3.4.1:\n- Run deploy_node to create an EC2 node with a MultiStepDeployment.\n- The MultiStepDeployment consists of 2 FileDeployment's followed by 1 ScriptDeployment\n\nThe deploy_node would work fine in Python 2.7.6 but failed when I switched to Python 3,4,1 with the following:\n\n```\nDeploymentError                           Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-18-79924dc2c1dc> in <module>()\n      2                           ex_security_groups=[SECURITY_GROUP_NAME],\n      3                           ex_keyname=KEY_NAME, deploy=deployment, ssh_username=USERNAME,\n----> 4                           ssh_key=PRIVATE_KEY_PATH)\n      5 print(node)\n\n/home/ereyes/.pyenv/versions/deploy3/lib/python3.4/site-packages/libcloud/compute/base.py in deploy_node(self, **kwargs)\n    924         if deploy_error is not None:\n    925             raise DeploymentError(node=node, original_exception=deploy_error,\n--> 926                                   driver=self)\n    927 \n    928         return node\n\nDeploymentError: <DeploymentError: node=i-1ff25335, error=<LibcloudError in <libcloud.compute.drivers.ec2.EC2NodeDriver object at 0x7f91a0782d68> \"Failed after 3 tries: string argument expected, got 'bytes'\">, driver=<libcloud.compute.drivers.ec2.EC2NodeDriver object at 0x7f91a0782d68>>\n```\n\nAfter instrumenting the code to print more informative stack traces, I located the source of the Exception, which was in ParamikoSSHClient.run(). The code where a data chunk is obtained from chan.recv() returns a bytes object in Python 3, where it presumably returns a descendant of basestring in Python 2. This object is then passed to stdout.write() (or stderr.write), which blows up because it's not a stringy value.\n\nMy change decodes the bytes into strings as they are passed into those write() methods.\n\nThis change made deploy_node() work in my code for Python 3.4.1. I'm not sure if the same type of bug exists elsewhere, but this fix is what I needed to unblock myself.\n\nThanks for the excellent library, and I hope this helps.\n","created_at":"2014-08-14T18:24:37Z","updated_at":"2014-08-15T18:28:37Z","closed_at":"2014-08-15T14:18:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"93fa536efb116c70636bfb75b5b1280b85639a9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/166985fb37f1378e59e6fff2cc086252ec861f3a","head":{"label":"ereyes01:ssh_decode","ref":"ssh_decode","sha":"166985fb37f1378e59e6fff2cc086252ec861f3a","user":{"login":"ereyes01","id":1884883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODQ4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1884883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01","html_url":"https://github.com/ereyes01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22963509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjk2MzUwOQ==","name":"libcloud","full_name":"ereyes01/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ereyes01","id":1884883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODQ4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1884883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01","html_url":"https://github.com/ereyes01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ereyes01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ereyes01/libcloud","description":"Apache
