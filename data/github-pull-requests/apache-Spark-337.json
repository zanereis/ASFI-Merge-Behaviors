What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInstead of only keeping the minimum number of offsets around, we should keep enough information to allow us to roll back n batches and reexecute the stream starting from a given point. In particular, we should create a config in SQLConf, spark.sql.streaming.retainedBatches that defaults to 100 and ensure that we keep enough log files in the following places to roll back the specified number of batches:\r\nthe offsets that are present in each batch\r\nversions of the state store\r\nthe files lists stored for the FileStreamSource\r\nthe metadata log stored by the FileStreamSink\r\n\r\n@marmbrus @zsxwing \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe following tests were added.\r\n\r\n### StreamExecution offset metadata\r\nTest added to StreamingQuerySuite that ensures offset metadata is garbage collected according to minBatchesRetain\r\n\r\n### CompactibleFileStreamLog\r\nTests added in CompactibleFileStreamLogSuite to ensure that logs are purged starting before the first compaction file that proceeds the current batch id - minBatchesToRetain.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSparkR provides the ability to distribute the computations by ```spark.lapply```. In many cases, the distributed computation depends on third-party R packages, and we need to install corresponding packages to executor in advance which is tedious and unappeasable. Since SparkR is an interactive analytic tools and users may load lots of native R packages across the session, it's difficult to install all necessary packages before starting SparkR session, so I

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr is to fix an issue occurred when resharding Kinesis streams; the resharding makes the KCL throw an exception because Spark does not checkpoint `SHARD_END` when finishing reading closed shards in `KinesisRecordProcessor#shutdown`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently JDBC data source creates tables in the target database using the default type mapping, and the JDBC dialect mechanism.  If users want to specify different database data type for only some of columns, there is no option available. In scenarios where default mapping does not work, users are forced to create tables on the target database before writing. This workaround is probably not acceptable from a usability point of view. This PR is to provide a user-defined type mapping for specific columns.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to allow users to specify database column data type for the create table  as JDBC datasource option(createTableColumnTypes) on write. Data type information can be specified in the same format as table schema DDL format (e.g: `name CHAR(64), comments VARCHAR(1024)`).\r\n\r\nAll supported target database types can not be specified ,  the data types has to be valid spark sql data types also.  For example user can not specify target database  CLOB data type. This will be supported in the follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```Scala\r\ndf.write\r\n.option(\"createTableColumnTypes\", \"name CHAR(64), comments VARCHAR(1024)\")\r\n.jdbc(url, \"TEST.DBCOLTYPETEST\", properties)\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test cases to the JDBCWriteSuite","created_at":"2016-12-08T06:58:55Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T08:43:10Z","closed_at":"2017-03-24T00:42:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0358e93cd2ad5100e7c2985d942f2615fafeb96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16209/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16209/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16209/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6f51d3ffbabc641098ad14a1649cda1839fda54a","head":{"label":"sureshthalamati:jdbc_custom_dbtype_option_json-spark-10849","ref":"jdbc_custom_dbtype_option_json-spark-10849","sha":"6f51d3ffbabc641098ad14a1649cda1839fda54a","user":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40833027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDgzMzAyNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sureshthalamati/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently JDBC data source creates tables in the target database using the default type mapping, and the JDBC dialect mechanism.  If users want to specify different database data type for only some of columns, there is no option available. In scenarios where default mapping does not work, users are forced to create tables on the target database before writing. This workaround is probably not acceptable from a usability point of view. This PR is to provide a user-defined type mapping for specific columns.\r\n \r\nThe solution is based on the existing Redshift connector (https://github.com/databricks/spark-redshift#setting-a-custom-column-type). We add a new column metadata property to the jdbc data source for users to specify database column type using the metadata.\r\n \r\nExample :\r\n```Scala\r\nval nvarcharMd = new MetadataBuilder().putString(“createTableColumnType\", \"NVARCHAR(123)\").build()\r\nval newDf = df.withColumn(\"name\", col(\"name\"), nvarcharMd)\r\nnewDf.write.mode(SaveMode.Overwrite).jdbc(url, \"TEST.USERDBTYPETEST\", properties)\r\n```\r\nOne restriction with this approach metadata modification is unsupported in the Python, SQL, and R language APIs. Users have to create a new data frame to specify the metadata with the _createTableColumnType_ property.\r\n \r\nAlternative approach is to add JDBC data source option for users to specify database column types information as JSON String. For more details , please refer to the [JDBC OPTION PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16209).\r\n\r\nTODO: Documentation for specifying the database column type\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test case to the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Changed FileStreamSource to use new FileStreamSourceOffset rather than LongOffset. The field is named as `logOffset` to make it more clear that this is a offset in the file stream log.\r\n- Fixed bug in FileStreamSourceLog, the field endId in the FileStreamSourceLog.get(startId, endId) was not being used at all. No test caught it earlier. Only my updated tests caught it.\r\n\r\nOther minor changes\r\n- Dont use batchId in the FileStreamSource, as calling it batch id is extremely miss leading. With multiple sources, it may happen that a new batch has no new data from a file source. So offset of FileStreamSource != batchId after that batch.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated unit test.","created_at":"2016-12-08T03:48:09Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T01:56:02Z","closed_at":"2016-12-09T01:56:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f6cb506bd3c330c76b90b238b0ee1238ed47129","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16205/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16205/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16205/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/05f8b56318f1c157ad39eac80081c8952cf20ffd","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-18776","ref":"SPARK-18776","sha":"05f8b56318f1c157ad39eac80081c8952cf20ffd","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark writes a single file out per task, sometimes leading to very large files. It would be great to have an option to limit the max number of records written per file in a task, to avoid humongous files.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a new write config option `maxRecordsPerFile` (default to a session-wide setting `spark.sql.files.maxRecordsPerFile`) that limits the max number of records written to a single file. A non-positive value indicates there is no limit (same behavior as not having this flag).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases in PartitionedWriteSuite for both dynamic partition insert and non-dynamic partition insert.\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-08T00:47:35Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T22:53:41Z","closed_at":"2016-12-21T22:53:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4acd300e7096f6eb36fb87e7d85fcabd3c68d392","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5bf2b324cb6ebecd09b278b87ed46720b671833f","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18775","ref":"SPARK-18775","sha":"5bf2b324cb6ebecd09b278b87ed46720b671833f","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

which\r\nwas mostly used as an \"empty config\" in unit tests, and adjusted the\r\nvery few tests that required a specific config.\r\n\r\nI also changed the config keys for AES encryption to live

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis relaxes the parsing of `Float` and `Double` columns to properly support mixed case values of `NaN` and (+/-)`Infinity`, as well as properly supporting (+/-)`Inf`. Currently a string literal of `Nan` or `InfinitY` will cause a task to fail instead of placing the record in the corrupt record column, and `Inf` causes a failure instead of being a valid double.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdditional unit tests have been added","created_at":"2016-12-07T23:43:03Z","updated_at":"2017-05-13T12:59:24Z","closed_at":"2017-05-13T12:59:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42b77033032615040334d0c23eacabdad57016ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11ac4438e12dc01ba252304da8793077280f3067","head":{"label":"NathanHowell:SPARK-18772","ref":"SPARK-18772","sha":"11ac4438e12dc01ba252304da8793077280f3067","user":{"login":"NathanHowell","id":170829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDgyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanHowell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18179192,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODE3OTE5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"NathanHowell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NathanHowell","id":170829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDgyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanHowell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanHowell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NathanHowell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeveral improvements to the SizeEstimator for performance, most of the benefit comes from, when estimating, contending to not contending on multiple threads. There can be a small boost in uncontended scenarios from the removal of the synchronisation code but the cost of that synchronisation when not truly contended is low. On the PageRank workload for HiBench we see 10-15% performance improvements (measuring elapsed times on average) with both IBM's SDK for Java and OpenJDK 8. I don't see any changes other than noise for the other workloads on this benchmark.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests but there are problems to resolve.\r\n\r\nI see SizeEstimatorSuite and SizeTrackerSuite failing with at least IBM Java now due to smaller sizes being reported than the test expects (let's see what happens with OpenJDK on the community runs). \r\n\r\nIn SizeTrackerSuite I think the failures are caused by using ThreadLocalRandom and not Random - because with Random we see these tests passing again. Not sure how robust SizeTrackerSuite is though.\r\n\r\nFor performance testing I've used HiBench, large profile, with one executor ranging from 10g to 25g, experimenting with fixed and dynamic heaps. The Spark code I've based my results on is from December the 1st (master branch, so 2.1.0 snapshot).\r\n\r\nMore details on the optimisations (this being phase one and JDK agnostic) at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when users use Python UDF in Filter, BatchEvalPython is always generated below FilterExec. However, not all the predicates need to be evaluated after Python UDF execution. Thus, this PR is to push down the determinisitc predicates through `BatchEvalPython`.\r\n```Python\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, \"1\"), (2, \"2\"), (1, \"2\"), (1, \"2\")], [\"key\", \"value\"])\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import BooleanType\r\n>>> my_filter = udf(lambda a: a < 2, BooleanType())\r\n>>> sel = df.select(col(\"key\"), col(\"value\")).filter((my_filter(col(\"key\"))) & (df.value < \"2\"))\r\n>>> sel.explain(True)\r\n```\r\nBefore the fix, the plan looks like\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter ((isnotnull(value#1) && <lambda>(key#0L)) && (value#1 < 2))\r\n+- LogicalRDD [key#0L, value#1]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Project [key#0L, value#1]\r\n+- *Filter ((isnotnull(value#1) && pythonUDF0#9) && (value#1 < 2))\r\n   +- BatchEvalPython [<lambda>(key#0L)], [key#0L, value#1, pythonUDF0#9]\r\n      +- Scan ExistingRDD[key#0L,value#1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, the plan looks like\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter ((isnotnull(value#1) && <lambda>(key#0L)) && (value#1 < 2))\r\n+- LogicalRDD [key#0L, value#1]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Project [key#0L, value#1]\r\n+- *Filter pythonUDF0#9: boolean\r\n   +- BatchEvalPython [<lambda>(key#0L)], [key#0L, value#1, pythonUDF0#9]\r\n      +- *Filter (isnotnull(value#1) && (value#1 < 2))\r\n         +- Scan ExistingRDD[key#0L,value#1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded both unit test cases for `BatchEvalPythonExec` and also add an end-to-end test case in Python test suite.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen SSL is enabled, the Spark shell shows:\r\n```\r\nSpark context Web UI available at https://192.168.99.1:4040\r\n```\r\nThis is wrong

It redirects to the https port.\r\nMore importantly, this introduces several broken links in the UI.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark's current task cancellation / task killing mechanism is \"best effort\" because some tasks may not be interruptible or may not respond to their \"killed\" flags being set. If a significant fraction of a cluster's task slots are occupied by tasks that have been marked as killed but remain running then this can lead to a situation where new jobs and tasks are starved of resources that are being used by these zombie tasks.\r\n\r\nThis patch aims to address this problem by adding a \"task reaper\" mechanism to executors. At a high-level, task killing now launches a new thread which attempts to kill the task and then watches the task and periodically checks whether it has been killed. The TaskReaper will periodically re-attempt to call `TaskRunner.kill()` and will log warnings if the task keeps running. I modified TaskRunner to rename its thread at the start of the task, allowing TaskReaper to take a thread dump and filter it in order to log stacktraces from the exact task thread that we are waiting to finish. If the task has not stopped after a configurable timeout then the TaskReaper will throw an exception to trigger executor JVM death, thereby forcibly freeing any resources consumed by the zombie tasks.\r\n\r\nThis feature is flagged off by default and is controlled by four new configurations under the `spark.task.reaper.*` namespace. See the updated `configuration.md` doc for details.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested via a new test case in `JobCancellationSuite`, plus manual testing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nListeners added with `sparkSession.streams.addListener(l)` are added to a SparkSession. So events only from queries in the same session as a listener should be posted to the listener. Currently, all the events gets rerouted through the Spark's main listener bus, that is, \r\n- StreamingQuery posts event to StreamingQueryListenerBus. Only the queries associated with the same session as the bus posts events to it.\r\n- StreamingQueryListenerBus posts event to Spark's main LiveListenerBus as a SparkEvent.\r\n- StreamingQueryListenerBus also subscribes to LiveListenerBus events thus getting back the posted event in a different thread. \r\n- The received is posted to the registered listeners.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that *all StreamingQueryListenerBuses in all sessions* gets the events and posts them to their listeners. This is wrong.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I solve it by making StreamingQueryListenerBus track active queries (by their runIds) when a query posts the QueryStarted event to the bus. This allows the rerouted events to be filtered using the tracked queries.\r\n\r\nNote that this list needs to be maintained separately\r\nfrom the `StreamingQueryManager.activeQueries` because a terminated query is cleared from\r\n`StreamingQueryManager.activeQueries` as soon as it is stopped, but the this ListenerBus must\r\nclear a query only after the termination event of that query has been posted lazily, much after the query has been terminated.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to @zsxwing for coming up with the initial idea.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated test harness code to use the correct session, and added new unit test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `FileSourceStrategy` does not handle the case when the pushed-down filter is `Literal(null)` and removes it at the post-filter in Spark-side.\r\n\r\nFor example, the codes below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq(Tuple1(Some(true)), Tuple1(None), Tuple1(Some(false))).toDF()\r\ndf.filter($\"_1\" === \"true\").explain(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nshows it keeps `null` properly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Filter ('_1 = true)\r\n+- LocalRelation [_1#17]\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\n_1: boolean\r\nFilter (cast(_1#17 as double) = cast(true as double))\r\n+- LocalRelation [_1#17]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter (isnotnull(_1#17) && null)\r\n+- LocalRelation [_1#17]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Filter (isnotnull(_1#17) && null)       << Here `null` is there\r\n+- LocalTableScan [_1#17]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when we read it back from Parquet,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval path = \"/tmp/testfile\"\r\ndf.write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).filter($\"_1\" === \"true\").explain(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`null` is removed at the post-filter.\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Filter ('_1 = true)\r\n+- Relation[_1#11] parquet\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\n_1: boolean\r\nFilter (cast(_1#11 as double) = cast(true as double))\r\n+- Relation[_1#11] parquet\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter (isnotnull(_1#11) && null)\r\n+- Relation[_1#11] parquet\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Project [_1#11]\r\n+- *Filter isnotnull(_1#11)       << Here `null` is missing\r\n   +- *FileScan parquet [_1#11] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/tmp/testfile], PartitionFilters: [null], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(_1)], ReadSchema: struct<_1:boolean>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it to keep it properly. In more details,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval partitionKeyFilters =\r\n  ExpressionSet(normalizedFilters.filter(_.references.subsetOf(partitionSet)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis keeps this `null` in `partitionKeyFilters` as `Literal` always don't have `children` and `references` is being empty  which is always the subset of `partitionSet`.\r\n\r\nAnd then in \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval afterScanFilters = filterSet -- partitionKeyFilters\r\n```\r\n\r\n`null` is always removed from the post filter. So, if the referenced fields are empty, it should be applied into data columns too.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, it becomes as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Filter ('_1 = true)\r\n+- Relation[_1#276] parquet\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\n_1: boolean\r\nFilter (cast(_1#276 as double) = cast(true as double))\r\n+- Relation[_1#276] parquet\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter (isnotnull(_1#276) && null)\r\n+- Relation[_1#276] parquet\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Project [_1#276]\r\n+- *Filter (isnotnull(_1#276) && null)\r\n   +- *FileScan parquet [_1#276] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/private/var/folders/9j/gf_c342d7d150mwrxvkqnc180000gn/T/spark-a5d59bdb-5b..., PartitionFilters: [null], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(_1)], ReadSchema: struct<_1:boolean>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test in

value of the \"isSrcLocal\" parameter passed to Hive's loadTable and\r\nloadPartition methods needs to be set according to the user query (e.g.\r\n\"LOAD DATA LOCAL\"), and not the current code that tries to guess what\r\nit should be.\r\n\r\nFor existing versions of Hive the current behavior is probably ok, but\r\nsome recent changes in the Hive code changed the semantics slightly,\r\nmaking code that sets \"isSrcLocal\" to \"true\" incorrectly to do the\r\nwrong thing. It would end up moving the parent directory of the files\r\ninto the final location, instead of the file themselves, resulting\r\nin a table that cannot be read.\r\n\r\nI modified HiveCommandSuite so that existing \"LOAD DATA\" tests are run\r\nboth in local and non-local mode, since the semantics are slightly different.\r\nThe tests include a few new checks to make sure the semantics follow\r\nwhat Hive describes in its documentation.\r\n\r\nTested with existing unit tests and also ran some Hive integration tests\r\nwith a version of Hive containing the changes that surfaced the problem.","created_at":"2016-12-07T00:31:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T22:53:30Z","closed_at":"2016-12-12T22:22:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57312d379dbd1ae41a804595a00f1ea68062ac82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16179/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16179/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16179/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4e37c808ac76b8b7e1f3b224da06828a191f3373","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-18752","ref":"SPARK-18752","sha":"4e37c808ac76b8b7e1f3b224da06828a191f3373","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTests in Spark Streaming currently create a `SparkContext` for each test, and sometimes do not clean-up afterwards. This is resource intensive and it can lead to unneeded test failures (flakyness) when park.driver.allowMultipleContexts is disabled (this happens when the order of tests changes).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes most test re-use a `SparkContext`. For tests that have to create a new context (for instance `CheckpointSuite`) we make sure that no active `SparkContext` exists before the test, and that the created `SparkContext` is cleaned up afterwards. I have refactored the `TestSuiteBase` into two classes `TestSuiteBase` and a parent class `ReusableSparkContext`; this to make `SparkContext` management relatively straightforward for most tests.\r\n\r\nI have done a simple very unscientific benchmark (n=1), and streaming tests with this patch took 212 seconds and streaming tests without this patch took 252 seconds.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch only covers test code.\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-06T16:52:20Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T23:02:37Z","closed_at":"2016-12-06T23:02:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f6fd087bc74e9516d01fa8ae10fe101f862087c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/04ce488e9d6927f3cb172e854928c78ec094fb8d","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-18741","ref":"SPARK-18741","sha":"04ce488e9d6927f3cb172e854928c78ec094fb8d","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we canonicalize the view definition to provide the context for the database as well as star expansion, this is fragile for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is non-trivial to guarantee that the generated SQL is correct without being extremely verbose, given the current set of operators.\r\n2. We need extensive testing for all combination of operators.\r\n3. Whenever we introduce a new logical plan operator, we need to be super careful because it might break SQL generation. \r\n\r\nWe use a late binding approach to do view canonicalization, which resolve the dependent views every time the view is used. This PR is expected to achieve the following goals:\r\n\r\n1. Views should reflect changes to the underlying tables and intermediate views. For example:\r\n    ```\r\n        CREATE TABLE T1(a int, b string)\r\n        CREATE TABLE T2(a int, b string, c int)\r\n        CREATE VIEW A AS SELECT * FROM T1\r\n        CREATE VIEW B AS SELECT * FROM A\r\n        ALTER VIEW A AS SELECT * FROM T2\r\n        SELECT * FROM B\r\n    ```\r\nwill return data from table T2 (Note that we still need to validate the schema).\r\n2. Make views more robust by not using SQL generation to store the view’s logical plan.\r\n3. The views generated by older versions of Spark or HIVE should still work or throw a meaningful error if the view definition is invalid.\r\n4. A view should throw a meaningful error when the view in an invalid state due to an underlying change. Such errors should be thrown as early as possible.\r\n\r\nThe follow up works will be:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the SQL generation (in particular the SQLBuilder class) for Spark SQL operators and the test suites(and also golden files) for them.\r\n2. Disallow cyclic view reference(See [SPARK-18389](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18389)).\r\n3. View dependency management similar to Postgres.\r\n4. Underlying table schema change when star is used.\r\n5. Support create permanent views on non-SQL DataFrames.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test cases in `SQLViewSuite`.","created_at":"2016-12-06T10:25:34Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T10:03:55Z","closed_at":"2016-12-09T10:03:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3945266340249b24a47c2e07c22480260defdf26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/434009ef7fcfc552314dca35dc9395bb98f5e9c6","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:view","ref":"view","sha":"434009ef7fcfc552314dca35dc9395bb98f5e9c6","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the full console output page of a Spark Jenkins PR build can be as large as several megabytes. It takes a relatively long time to load and may even freeze the browser for quite a while.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the build script to post the test report page link to GitHub instead. The test report page is way more concise and is usually the first page I'd like to check when investigating a Jenkins build failure.\r\n\r\nNote that for builds that a test report is not available

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\njira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18724\r\n\r\nCurrently TrainValidationSplitModel only provides tuning metrics in the format of Array[Double], which makes it harder for matching the metrics back to the paramMap generating them and affects the user experience for the tuning framework.\r\nAdd a Tuning Summary to provide better presentation for the tuning metrics, for now the idea is to use a DataFrame listing all the params and corresponding metrics.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7981698/20938094/7fb7a7ca-bb9e-11e6-9ca9-786e36ecd1ac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tuning Summary Class can be further extended for CrossValidator.\r\nWe can also add training time statistics and metrics rank to the data frame if that sounds good.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nTo support pipeline estimator, change the tuning summary

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen `spark.sql.parquet.filterPushdown` is on, SparkSQL's Parquet reader pushes down filters to Parquet file when creating reader, in order to start with filtered blocks. However, when the parquet file does not have the predicate column(s), Parquet-mr throw exceptions complaining the filter column does not existing. This issue will be fixed in parquet-mr 1.9. But Spark 2.1 is still on parquet 1.8. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to tolerate such exception thrown by Parquet-mr and just return all the blocks from the current parquet file to the created SparkSQL parquet reader. Filters will be applied again anyway in later physical plan operation. According to following example physical plan:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Project [a#2805, b#2806, c#2807]\r\n+- *Filter ((isnotnull(a#2805) && isnull(c#2807)) && (a#2805 < 2))\r\n  +- *FileScan parquet [a#2805,b#2806,c#2807] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/Users/xinwu/spark/target/tmp/spark-ed6f0c12-6494-4ac5-b485-5b986ef475cc], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(a), IsNull(c), LessThan(a,2)], ReadSchema: struct<a:int,b:string,c:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nA unit test case is added.

need to track JVM instances, which could be wrong.\r\n* Small refactor of `SerDe.sqlSerDe` to increase readability.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Added unit tests for

AIC calculation in Binomial GLM seems to be off when the response or weight is non-integer: the result is different from that in R. This issue arises when one models rates, i.e, num of successes normalized over num of trials, and uses num of trials as weights. In this case, the effective likelihood is  weight * label ~ binomial(weight, mu), where weight = number of trials, and weight * label = number of successes and mu = is the success rate.  \r\n\r\n@srowen @sethah @yanboliang @HyukjinKwon @zhengruifeng \r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI suggest changing the current aic calculation for the Binomial family from \r\n```\r\n-2.0 * predictions.map { case (y: Double, mu: Double, weight: Double) =>\r\n        weight * dist.Binomial(1, mu).logProbabilityOf(math.round(y).toInt)\r\n      }.sum()\r\n```\r\nto the following which generalizes to the case of real-valued response and weights. \r\n```\r\n      -2.0 * predictions.map { case (y: Double, mu: Double, weight: Double) =>\r\n        val wt = math.round(weight).toInt\r\n        if (wt == 0){\r\n          0.0\r\n        } else {\r\n          dist.Binomial(wt, mu).logProbabilityOf(math.round(y * weight).toInt)\r\n        }\r\n      }.sum()\r\n``` \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI will write the unit test once the community wants to include the proposed change. For now, the following modifies existing tests in weighted Binomial GLM to illustrate the issue. The second label is changed from 0 to 0.5. \r\n\r\n```\r\nval datasetWithWeight = Seq(\r\n    (1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 5.0),\r\n    (0.5, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0),\r\n    (1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0),\r\n    (0.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0)\r\n  ).toDF(\"y\", \"w\", \"x1\", \"x2\")\r\n\r\nval formula = (new RFormula()\r\n  .setFormula(\"y ~ x1 + x2\")\r\n  .setFeaturesCol(\"features\")\r\n  .setLabelCol(\"label\"))\r\nval output = formula.fit(datasetWithWeight).transform(datasetWithWeight).select(\"features\", \"label\", \"w\")\r\n\r\nval glr = new GeneralizedLinearRegression()\r\n    .setFamily(\"binomial\")\r\n    .setWeightCol(\"w\")\r\n    .setFitIntercept(false)\r\n    .setRegParam(0)\r\n\r\nval model = glr.fit(output)\r\nmodel.summary.aic\r\n```\r\nThe AIC from Spark is 17.3227, and the AIC from R is 15.66454.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* Add all R examples for ML wrappers which were added during 2.1 release cycle.\r\n* Split the whole ```ml.R``` example file into individual example for each algorithm, which will be convenient for users to rerun them.\r\n* Add corresponding examples to ML user guide.\r\n* Update ML section of SparkR user guide. \r\n\r\nNote: MLlib Scala/Java/Python examples will be consistent, however, SparkR examples may different from them, since R users may use the algorithms in a different way, for example, using R ```formula``` to specify ```featuresCol``` and ```labelCol```.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRun all examples

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix for SPARK-18091 which is a bug related to large if expressions causing generated SpecificUnsafeProjection code to exceed JVM code size limit.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes if expression's code generation to place its predicate, true value and false value expressions' generated code in separate methods in context so as to never generate too long combined code.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test and also tested manually with the application (having transformations similar to the unit test) which caused the issue to be identified in the first

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a long-standing bug, it's hidden until https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15780 , which may add `AssertNotNull` on top of `LambdaVariable` and thus enables subexpression elimination.\r\n\r\nHowever, subexpression elimination will evaluate the common expressions at the beginning, which is invalid for `LambdaVariable`. `LambdaVariable` usually represents loop variable, which can't be evaluated ahead of the loop.\r\n\r\nThis PR skips expressions containing `LambdaVariable` when doing subexpression elimination.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nupdated test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe've had reports of overfull disk usage of spark event log file. Current implementation has following drawbacks:\r\n1. If we did not start Spark HistoryServer or Spark HistoryServer just failed, there is no chance to do clean work.\r\n2. Spark HistoryServer is cleaning event log file based on file age only. If there are abundant applications constantly, the disk usage in every **spark.history.fs.cleaner.maxAge** can still be very large.\r\n\r\nIn this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Do once clean work before save new application event log.\r\n2. Provide a new clean mode, i.e. **space** mode with **age** mode default as existing implementation. We can set the max disk space to preserve the spark job event log. The excess part of job history files will be deleted, oldest file first. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs the scenario describe in [SPARK-18700](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18700), when cachedDataSourceTables invalided, the coming few queries will fetch all FileStatus in listLeafFiles function. In the condition of table has many partitions, these jobs will occupy much memory of driver finally may cause driver OOM.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, add StripedLock for each table's relation in cache not for the whole cachedDataSourceTables, each table's load cache operation protected by it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a multi-thread access table test in `PartitionedTablePerfStatsSuite` and check it only loading once using metrics in `HiveCatalogMetrics`\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-04T06:52:27Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T01:58:03Z","closed_at":"2016-12-19T19:34:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5814f6502ac7f98fbf52542285ad3c04e92a64af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5beccaa6996475fe1bd5f4e5416a2c1c61e83998","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-18700","ref":"SPARK-18700","sha":"5beccaa6996475fe1bd5f4e5416a2c1c61e83998","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

This could eat a lot of spaces and slow down the JVM termination. When the JVM does not terminates approprately, the files might not be dropped.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to drop the created staging files and temporary data files after each insert/CTAS. \r\n\r\n### How was

GLM fails for many standard data sets (see example in test or JIRA). The issue is incorrect initialization leading to almost zero probability and weights. Specifically, the mean is initialized as the response, which could be zero. Applying the log link results in very negative numbers (protected against -Inf), which again leads to close to zero probability and weights in the weighted least squares. Fix and test are included in the commits.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate initialization in Poisson GLM\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix reservoir sampling bias for small k.
