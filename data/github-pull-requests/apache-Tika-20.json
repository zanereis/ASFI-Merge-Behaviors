patch adds version-specific mimetype patterns for Lotus 1-2-3 and Quattro Pro spreadsheets. \r\n\r\nThe magic patterns were adapted from the UK National Archive's [PRONOM](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx) registry. Some additional info below: \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nPRONOM is published under the Open Government license:\r\n\r\n<http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/>\r\n\r\nI added an attribution to this source in NOTICE, as per:\r\n\r\n<https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html>\r\n\r\n## Sample files\r\n\r\nI also included sample files for all of these formats to test-documents:\r\n\r\n* I created the .wks, .wb1 and .wb2 samples from a copy of Quattro Pro 6.0 running under Windows 3.11 on a virtual machine. \r\n\r\n* The .wk4 and .123 sample files (note 'lotusftp' name suffix) were taken from the Internet Archive's mirror of the old Lotus FTP site:  \r\n\r\n<https://archive.org/details/2012_11_24_ftp_lotus_com>\r\n\r\n* The .wk1, .wk3, .wq1 and .wq2 samples are old files from my personal collection.\r\n\r\nBelow the detection results for all Lotus / Quattro Pro files in *test-documents* (including the previously existing ones):\r\n\r\n|Filename|mimeype|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|testLotus123.wks|application/vnd.lotus-1-2-3; version=1|\r\n|testLotus123.wk1|application/vnd.lotus-1-2-3; version=2|\r\n|testLotus123.wk3|application/vnd.lotus-1-2-3; version=3|\r\n|testLotus123-lotusftp.wk4|application/vnd.lotus-1-2-3; version=4|\r\n|testLotus123-lotusftp.123|application/vnd.lotus-1-2-3; version=97+9.x|\r\n|testQuattro.wq1|application/x-quattro-pro; version=1-4|\r\n|testQuattro.wq2|application/x-quattro-pro; version=5|\r\n|testQuattro.wb1|application/x-quattro-pro; version=1+5|\r\n|testQuattro.wb2|application/x-quattro-pro; version=6|\r\n|testQUATTRO.wb3|application/x-quattro-pro; version=7-8|\r\n|testQUATTRO.qpw|application/x-quattro-pro; version=9|\r\n\r\n## Possible issues\r\n\r\nCouple of small things to watch here. First of all I wasn't quite sure how to use the \"version\" field for the following format/version combinations:\r\n\r\n* `\"application/vnd.lotus-1-2-3;version=97+9.x\"`\r\n* `\"application/x-quattro-pro;version=1-4\"`\r\n* `\"application/x-quattro-pro;version=1+5\"`\r\n\r\nThis all looks a bit ugly to me; maybe there's a better way to do this. Also, the versioning for the Quattro Pro formats is weird because Quattro Pro for DOS 4 was follwed up by version 1 for Windows, which was in turn followed by version 5! Perhaps the \"1+5\" entry should be changed to simply \"5\" (which is not strictly correct, but possibly less confusing).\r\n\r\nOther thing was that my attempts to include glob patterns for Lotus 1 (.wks) resulted in a conflict with `\"application/vnd.ms-works\"`, so I commented them out nof the Lotus definitions for now. I'm don't quite follow the underlying rules/logic, maybe there's some way to include them after all.\r\n\r\n## Addition 19 September:  added WordPerfect 4.2 mimetype definition\r\n\r\nI also include a mimetype definition for WordPerfect 4.2, which is derived from the trID pattern by Philip Storry. From the TrID website I understand its is released under a AGPL license:\r\n \r\n<http://mark0.net/soft-tridscan-e.html>\r\n\r\nNot 100% clear to me if this is compatible with the Apache license. If not, perhaps the WP definition should be left out.\r\n\r\nI provided a sample file as well.

Tika currently provides many _ContentHandler_ which help to de-obfuscate specific types of information from text. For instance, the `PhoneExtractingContentHandler` is used to extract phone numbers while parsing.\r\n\r\nThis improvement adds the **`StandardsExtractingContentHandler`** to Tika, a new ContentHandler that relies on regular expressions in order to identify and extract standard references from text. \r\nBasically, a standard reference is just a reference to a norm/convention/requirement (i.e., a standard) released by a standard organization. This work is maily focused on identifying and extracting the references to the standards already cited within a given document (e.g., SOW/PWS) so the references can be stored and provided to the user as additional metadata in case the `StandardExtractingContentHandler` is used.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the patch, the first version of the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler` along with an example class to easily execute the handler is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/giuseppetotaro/StandardsExtractingContentHandler). The following sections provide more in detail how the `StandardsExtractingHandler` has been developed.\r\n\r\nAll the details are reported on Jira ([TIKA-2449](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2449)).\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, a standard reference is a string that is usually composed of two parts: \r\n1. the name of the standard organization; \r\n2.  the alphanumeric identifier of the standard within the organization. \r\nSpecifically, the first part can include the acronym or the full name of the standard organization or even both, and the second part can include an alphanumeric string, possibly containing one or more separation symbols (e.g., \"-\", \"_\", \".\") depending on the format adopted by the organization, representing the identifier of the standard within the organization.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the standard references are usually reported within the \"Applicable Documents\" or \"References\" section of a SOW, and they can be cited also within sections that include in the header the word \"standard\", \"requirement\", \"guideline\", or \"compliance\".\r\n\r\nConsequently, the citation of standard references within a SOW/PWS document can be summarized by the following rules:\r\n* **RULE 1**: standard references are usually reported within the section named \"Applicable Documents\" or \"References\".\r\n* **RULE 2**: standard references can be cited also within sections including the word \"compliance\" or another semantically-equivalent word in their name.\r\n* **RULE 3**: standard references is composed of two parts:\r\n  * Name of the standard organization (acronym, full name, or both).\r\n  * Alphanumeric identifier of the standard within the organization.\r\n* **RULE 4**: The name of the standard organization includes the acronym or the full name or both. The name must belong to the set of standard organizations `S = O U V`, where `O` represents the set of open standard organizations (e.g., ANSI) and `V` represents the set of vendor-specific standard organizations (e.g., Motorola).\r\n* **RULE 5**: A separation symbol (e.g., \"-\", \"_\", \".\" or whitespace) can be used between the name of the standard organization and the alphanumeric identifier.\r\n* **RULE 6**: The alphanumeric identifier of the standard is composed of alphabetic and numeric characters, possibly split in two or more parts by a separation symbol (e.g., \"-\", \"_\", \".\").\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the above rules, here are some examples of formats used for reporting standard references within a SOW/PWS:\r\n* `<ORGANIZATION_ACRONYM><SEPARATION_SYMBOL><ALPHANUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>`\r\n* `<ORGANIZATION_ACRONYM><SEPARATION_SYMBOL>(<ORGANIZATION_FULL_NAME>)<SEPARATION_SYMBOL><ALPHANUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>`\r\n* `<ORGANIZATION_FULL_NAME><SEPARATION_SYMBOL>(<ORGANIZATION_FULL_NAME>)<SEPARATION_SYMBOL><ALPHANUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>`\r\n\r\nMoreover, some standards are sometimes released by two standard organizations. In this case, the standard reference can be reported as follows:\r\n* `<MAIN_ORGANIZATION_ACRONYM>/<SECOND_ORGANIZATION_ACRONYM><SEPARATION_SYMBOL><ALPHANUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>`\r\n\r\n## Regular Expressions\r\n\r\nThe `StandardsExtractingContentHandler` uses a helper class named `StandardsText` that relies on Java regular expressions and provides some methods to identify headers and standard references, and determine the score of the references found within the given text.\r\n\r\nHere are the main regular expressions used within the `StandardsText` class:\r\n* **REGEX_HEADER**: regular expression to match only uppercase headers.\r\n  ```\r\n  (\\d+\\.(\\d+\\.?)*)\\p{Blank}+([A-Z]+(\\s[A-Z]+)*){5,}\r\n  ```\r\n* **REGEX_APPLICABLE_DOCUMENTS**: regular expression to match the the header of \"APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS\" and equivalent sections.\r\n  ```\r\n  (?i:.*APPLICABLE\\sDOCUMENTS|REFERENCE|STANDARD|REQUIREMENT|GUIDELINE|COMPLIANCE.*)\r\n  ```\r\n* **REGEX_FALLBACK**: regular expression to match a string that is supposed to be a standard reference.\r\n  ```\r\n  \\(?(?<mainOrganization>[A-Z]\\w+)\\)?((\\s?(?<separator>\\/)\\s?)(\\w+\\s)*\\(?(?<secondOrganization>[A-Z]\\w+)\\)?)?(\\s(Publication|Standard))?(-|\\s)?(?<identifier>([0-9]{3,}|([A-Z]+(-|_|\\.)?[0-9]{2,}))((-|_|\\.)?[A-Z0-9]+)*)\r\n  ```\r\n* **REGEX_STANDARD**: regular expression to match the standard organization within a string potentially representing a standard reference.\r\n  This regular expression is obtained by using a helper class named `StandardOrganizations` that provides a list of the most important standard organizations reported on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_technical_standard_organisations). Basically, the list is composed of International standard organizations, Regional standard organizations, and American and British among Nationally-based standard organizations. Other lists of standard organizations are reported on [OpenStandards](http://www.openstandards.net/viewOSnet2C.jsp?showModuleName=Organizations) and [IBR Standards Portal](https://ibr.ansi.org/Standards/).\r\n\r\n## How To Use The Standards Extraction Capability\r\n\r\nThe standard references identification performed by using the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler` is based on the following steps (see also the [flow chart](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12885939/flowchart_standards_extraction_v02.png)):\r\n1. searches for headers;\r\n2. searches for patterns that are supposed to be standard references (basically, every string mostly composed of uppercase letters followed by an alphanumeric characters);\r\n3. each potential standard reference starts with score equal to 0.25;\r\n4. increases by 0.50 the score of references which include the name of a known standard organization;\r\n5. increases by 0.25 the score of references which have been found within \"Applicable Documents\" and equivalent sections;\r\n6. returns the standard references along with scores;\r\n7. adds the standard references as additional metadata.\r\n\r\nThe unit test is implemented within the **`StandardsExtractingContentHandlerTest`** class and extracts the standard references from a SOW downloaded from the [FOIA Library](https://foiarr.cbp.gov/streamingWord.asp?i=607). This SOW is also provide on [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12884323/SOW-TacCOM.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe **`StandardsExtractionExample`** is a class to demonstrate how to use the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler` to get a list of the standard references from every file in a directory.","created_at":"2017-08-30T16:54:18Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T00:35:42Z","closed_at":"2017-09-14T00:35:24Z","merged_at":"2017-09-14T00:35:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"31625a2ad6b9a4de73aa322845fb1e38ba96177d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/31625a2ad6b9a4de73aa322845fb1e38ba96177d","head":{"label":"giuseppetotaro:TIKA-2449","ref":"TIKA-2449","sha":"31625a2ad6b9a4de73aa322845fb1e38ba96177d","user":{"login":"giuseppetotaro","id":8323664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjM2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8323664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro","html_url":"https://github.com/giuseppetotaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseppetotaro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"70de289b865043bab98a33e268e80e3ffce9ecee","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206427,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0Mjc=","name":"tika","full_name":"apache/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika","description":"The

This is a modified form of #159 raised earlier by me.\r\nI have imported VGG16 model into tika-dl module using deeplearning4j .\r\nThe usage of this recogniser is very similar to TensorFlowRESTrecogniser but it doesn't require any external setup, like running RESTservice in as in case of TensorFlowRESTrecogniser.\r\nYou can read more about TensorFlowRESTrecogniser at https://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaAndVision\r\n\r\nTo use the DL4JVGG16Net set\r\nclass param to org.apache.tika.dl.imagerec.DL4JVGG16Net\r\nmodelType to VGG16\r\nsample configuration is given below for refference.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<properties>\r\n    <parsers>\r\n        <parser class=\"org.apache.tika.parser.recognition.ObjectRecognitionParser\">\r\n            <mime>image/jpeg</mime>\r\n            <params>\r\n                <param name=\"topN\" type=\"int\">2</param>\r\n                <param name=\"minConfidence\" type=\"double\">0.015</param>\r\n                <param name=\"class\" type=\"string\">org.apache.tika.dl.imagerec.DL4JVGG16Net</param>\r\n\t\t<param name=\"modelType\" type=\"string\">VGG16</param>\r\n\t\t<param name=\"serialize\" type=\"string\">yes</param>\r\n            </params>\r\n        </parser>\r\n    </parsers>\r\n</properties>\r\n```\r\nSave the configuration at your preffered location. \r\nA default one is provided at ``` tika-dl/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/dl/imagerec/dl4j-vgg16-config.xml ```\r\n\r\nTo run it in default configuration, build the project and move to root directory of the project and run the command.\r\n\r\n'``` java -Xmx3G -cp ./tika-dl/target/tika-dl-1.15-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar;tika-app/target/tika-app-1.15-SNAPSHOT.jar org.apache.tika.cli.TikaCLI  --config=tika-dl/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/dl/imagerec/dl4j-vgg16-config.xml tika-dl/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/dl/imagerec/lion.jpg```\r\n-Xmx3G is required because VGG16 model requires quite a lot of memory to run.\r\nObservations:\r\nWhen loading searilized model from disk:\r\nIt only require around 1200mb of ram to run.\r\n\r\nWhen model is loaded from h5 files using helper functions\r\nIt requires 2500mb of ram to run the model (required only one time if serialization is set to yes)\r\n\r\nOnce the model runs, it automatically downloads the model file using helper functions of DL4J locally at .dl4j/trainedModels\r\nTo speed up the process in future, once the model is loaded from original hash files, it is serialized and saved on disk at .dl4j/trainedModels/tikaPreprocessed which significantly reduces\r\nthe resource usage (specially memory consumption) for future loads.\r\nIssue

Turns out tika-parsers relies on a lot of transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThese commits try to specify (some) direct dependencies for libraries that are used in imports of parser classes. Additionally one of the test cases failed on my local setup with a non-default-English locale.","created_at":"2017-04-25T13:49:23Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T14:38:44Z","closed_at":"2018-12-01T14:38:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e738205de4c10064de117a5bef11bc6e121f290","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/8faaa8822c884fe550a1abf5dca050b565866449","head":{"label":"user667:QA-Cleanup-of-direct-dependencies","ref":"QA-Cleanup-of-direct-dependencies","sha":"8faaa8822c884fe550a1abf5dca050b565866449","user":{"login":"user667","id":1074502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1074502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667","html_url":"https://github.com/user667","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user667/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"347e601d4bffdac82a5a8953dd0e770163ebd05d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206427,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0Mjc=","name":"tika","full_name":"apache/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika","description":"The

Summary\r\n\r\n+ added `tika-dl` module which depends on `deeplearning4j` library. This module will produce an addon with all the DL4J dependencies and its native dependencies which may be optionally added to classpath by user to make use of it\r\n  + By default, the build system includes native libs for all major platforms (such as Linux, Windows, OSX, Android/ARM) \r\n  + Unnecessary native libs can be easily excluded by setting the target platform as `-Djavacpp.platform=<target>` during the build\r\n  + Permissible target values = {`android-arm`, `linux-x86_64`, `macosx-x86_64`, `windows-x86_64`, etc.}\r\n+ added `DL4JInceptionV3Net.java` which provides Image recognition features using InceptionV3. \r\n  + Similar to VGG-16 model in #159, VGG-16 model is huuuuge (over 500MB to download)and requires plenty of RAM (~3GB) to run. The beauty of Inception-V3 model is that it is just 90MB to download and requires ~400MB to run\r\n  +  No setup required. This implementation is configured to download the model when it runs the first time. It downloads from our [USCDataScience's repo](https://github.com/USCDataScience/dl4j-kerasimport-examples/tree/master/dl4j-import-example/data)\r\n   + It is flexible. Offers plenty of settings to change them. Look for `@Field` annotation in the code\r\n+ added a Test case to test the above implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Test\r\n1. Build the code : `mvn package` or `mvn package -DskipTests` or `mvn package -DskipTests -Djavacpp.platform=<>`\r\n2. Run:\r\n```bash\r\njava -Xmx400m -cp ./tika-dl/target/tika-dl-1.15-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar:tika-app/target/tika-app-1.15-SNAPSHOT.jar \\\r\n org.apache.tika.cli.TikaCLI  --config=tika-dl/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/dl/imagerec/dl4j-inception3-config.xml dog.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Note:\r\nTested on `macosx-x86_64` platform, we have to test on `linux-x86_64` and

Summary:\r\nObject Recognition Parser currently uses Inception V3 model for the object classification task. Google released a newer Inception V4 model [1][2].\r\nIt has an improved Top -1 accuracy of 80.2 and Top-5 accuracy of 95.2 [3].\r\n\r\n## Quick setup and Test:\r\n- Install tensor flow using pip -[https://www.tensorflow.org/install/](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)\r\n- Install TF-slim \r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models/   \r\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:/models/slim\" (replace with your installation directory)   \r\n\r\nsudo apt-get install libtcmalloc-minimal4   \r\nexport LD_PRELOAD=\"/usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4\"   \r\n```\r\n- NOTE: The last two lines are added due to tensorflow issues [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6968](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6968). It would be removed once it is fixed.\r\n- It can be evaded by integrating parts of tensorflow/models code into our repository. It has Apache license. So, it can be done.\r\n \r\n- Checkout the test case `tika-parsers/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/parser/recognition/tika-config-tflow.xml`\r\n\r\n## Demos:\r\n`java -jar tika-app/target/tika-app-1.15-SNAPSHOT.jar --config=tika-parsers/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/parser/recognition/tika-config-tflow.xml tika-parsers/src/test/resources/test-documents/testJPEG.jpg\r\n`\r\n- The output would include:\r\n```\r\n<meta name=\"OBJECT\" content=\"Egyptian cat (0.31143)\"/>  \r\n<meta name=\"OBJECT\" content=\"tabby, tabby cat (0.07072)\"/>  \r\n```\r\n- NOTE: Only jpeg format is supported. I would work on other format support during GSoC ([https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2262](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2262)).\r\n\r\n# REST API\r\n## Start the inception service on 8764 port : \r\nThe API service code is added at `tika-parsers/src/main/resources/org/apache/tika/parser/recognition/tf/inceptionapi.py`\r\n\r\nAlso, a docker file is added to setup the environment quickly\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd tika-parsers/src/main/resources/org/apache/tika/parser/recognition/tf/\r\ndocker build -f InceptionRestDockerfile -t inception-rest-tika .\r\ndocker run -p 8764:8764 -it inception-rest-tika\r\n```\r\n- Use the config at `tika-parsers/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/parser/recognition/tika-config-tflow-rest.xml`\r\n\r\n# Tests and build\r\n## Build status\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Tika parent ................................

have imported VGG16 model into Apache tika using deeplearning4j.\r\nThe usage of this recogniser is very similar to TensorFlowRESTrecogniser but it doesn't require any external setup, like running  RESTservice in as in case of TensorFlowRESTrecogniser.\r\nYou can read more about TensorFlowRESTrecogniser at https://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaAndVision\r\n\r\nTo use the DL4JImageRecogniser set\r\nclass param to org.apache.tika.parser.recognition.dl4j.DL4JImageRecogniser\r\nmodelType to VGG16\r\nsample configuration is given below for refference. \r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<properties>\r\n    <parsers>\r\n        <parser class=\"org.apache.tika.parser.recognition.ObjectRecognitionParser\">\r\n            <mime>image/jpeg</mime>\r\n            <params>\r\n                <param name=\"topN\" type=\"int\">5</param>\r\n                <param name=\"minConfidence\" type=\"double\">0.015</param>\r\n                <param name=\"class\" type=\"string\">org.apache.tika.parser.recognition.dl4j.DL4JImageRecogniser</param>\r\n\t\t\t\t        <param name=\"modelType\" type=\"string\">VGG16</param> \r\n            </params>\r\n        </parser>\r\n    </parsers>\r\n</properties>\r\n```\r\nSave the configuration at : `tika-parsers/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/parser/recognition/tika-config-tflow-rest`\r\n\r\nTo run it, build the project and move to root directory of the project and run the command\r\n\r\n`java -Xmx3G -jar tika-app/target/tika-app-1.14.jar --config=tika-parsers/src/test/resources/org/apache/tika/parser/recognition/tika-config-tflow-rest.xml <path to your image file>`\r\n\r\n-Xmx3G is required because VGG16 model requires quite a lot of memory to run. If your system is not able to run it, you may try to pump up the memory further\r\n\r\nOnce the model runs, it automatically downloads the model file using helper functions of DL4J locally at .dl4j/trainedModels\r\nTo speed up the process in future, once the model is loaded from original hash files, it is serialized and saved on disk at .dl4j/trainedModels/tikaPreprocessed which significantly reduces\r\nthe resource usage (specially memory consumption) for future loads.\r\nFor more details you can red this gist:

of changes:\n- Fixed TIKA-2002 : ExternalParser.check() empties stdout and stderr buffers so no more hanging is expected\n- Added ObjectRecognitionParser, ObjectRecogniser, RecognisedObject - A parser, interface and a model class respectively\n- implemented TensorFlowImageRecParser - an `ExternalParser` which (if missing) downloads and calls tensorflow `image_classify.py` script (the script then downloads Inception-v3 model) \n\n---\n## Quick Setup and Test\n-  Install tensor flow using pip - https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation\n- Checkout the test case  `tika-parsers/src/test/java/org/apache/tika/parser/recognition/ObjectRecognitionParserTest.java`\n## Demos\n\nCompile package : `mvn clean install` # `-DskipTests` if you dont like to wait for tests\n\nLets check \n- (for animal lovers,) on a cat's image at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/tika/master/tika-parsers/src/test/resources/test-documents/testJPEG.jpg\n\n```\njava

The most efficient way to make use of tensorflow would be to use C++ api via JNI. I didn't have a chance to learn that stuff so far so help needed to make this efficient. Or else we may wait for tensorflow folks to offer Java bindings! Right now, the image recognition model is loaded and unloaded every time by the script (200MB of disk-read per parse call, very inefficient!).\n2. The very first call takes plenty of time as the model is downloaded lazily\n3.  Only `image/jpeg` is supported. PNG coming later\n","created_at":"2016-06-12T03:26:49Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T15:15:24Z","closed_at":"2016-08-14T18:46:32Z","merged_at":"2016-08-14T18:46:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1d1a81d15b287b44041d590d8b124be06af0a19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/125/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/125/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/125/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/a1d1a81d15b287b44041d590d8b124be06af0a19","head":{"label":"thammegowda:TIKA-1993","ref":"TIKA-1993","sha":"a1d1a81d15b287b44041d590d8b124be06af0a19","user":{"login":"thammegowda","id":1865964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU5NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1865964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda","html_url":"https://github.com/thammegowda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:TIKA-1508","ref":"TIKA-1508","sha":"4c7481e5984e3cdf93c68c2c57fe4a627c7bc51b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206427,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0Mjc=","name":"tika","full_name":"apache/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika","description":"The
