and this is only in the master.\r\n\r\nNo behaviour changes to end users as it happened only in the master.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest was added.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-22T18:27:17Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:31Z","closed_at":"2019-11-23T08:25:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17099cdacd9166d2ee0f4f46b87487de7142e36d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b7bf47afd624223857a9e61c5b4940f3e9f11674","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-30003","ref":"SPARK-30003","sha":"b7bf47afd624223857a9e61c5b4940f3e9f11674","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

type, we rely on java.math. BigDecimal. It can't accept leading and training spaces, as you can see in the above links. This behavior is not consistent with other numeric types now. we need to fix it and keep consistency.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nmake string to numeric types be consistent\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nyes, string removed trailing or leading white spaces will be able to convert to decimal if the trimmed is valid\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n1. modify ut\r\n\r\n#### Benchmark\r\n```scala\r\n/*\r\n * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n * contributor license agreements.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch checks the existence of output file for each task while committing the task, so that it doesn't throw FileNotFoundException while creating SinkFileStatus. The check is newly required for DSv2 implementation of FileStreamSink, as it is changed to create the output file lazily (as an improvement).\r\n\r\nJSON writer for example: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9ec2a4e58caa4128e9c690d72239cebd6b732084/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/json/JsonOutputWriter.scala#L49-L60\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, FileStreamSink throws FileNotFoundException when writing empty partition.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd extra classnames to table headers in EnvironmentPage tables in Spark UI.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkUI uses sorttable.js to provide the sort functionality in different tables. This library tries to guess the datatype of each column during initialization phase - numeric/alphanumeric etc and uses it to sort the columns whenever user clicks on a column. That way it guesses incorrect data type for environment tab. \r\n\r\nsorttable.js has way to hint the datatype of table columns explicitly. This is done by passing custom HTML class attribute.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested sorting in tables in Environment tab in Spark UI.\r\n\r\n![Annotation 2019-11-22 154058](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2551496/69417432-a8d6bc00-0d3e-11ea-865b-f8017976c6f4.png)\r\n![Annotation 2019-11-22

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new WILDCARD task location that can match any host. This WILDCARD location can be used together with other regular locations in the list of preferred locations to indicate that the task can be assigned to any host/executor if none of the preferred locations is available.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is motivated by the requirement from LocalShuffledRowRDD. When the number of initial mappers of LocalShuffledRowRDD is smaller than the number of worker nodes, it can cause serious regressions if short-running tasks all wait on their preferred locations while they could have otherwise finished quickly on non-preferred locations too.\r\n\r\nWe have a \"locality wait time\" configuration that allows a task set to downgrade locality requirement after a certain time has passed. Yet, this configuration affects all task sets in the scheduler, and tasks all differ in penalty of locality miss. Thus, we need this finer-grained option for individual tasks to opt out of locality.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT.","created_at":"2019-11-22T04:03:27Z","updated_at":"2020-03-21T00:10:24Z","closed_at":"2020-03-21T00:10:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c6b27f0a72608b84c3120c468eec39aa3eab721","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

are 3 different issues that cause the same underlying problem: an executor\r\nthat the driver has killed during downscaling registers back with the block\r\nmanager in the driver, and the block manager from that point on keeps trying\r\nto contact the dead executor.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that the heartbeat receiver was asking unknown executors to\r\nre-register when receiving a heartbeat. That code path only really happens\r\nwhen the executor dies because of a driver killing it, so there's no reason\r\nto re-register.\r\n\r\nThe second one is a race between the heartbeat receiver and the DAG scheduler.\r\nBoth received notifications of an executor's addition and removal\r\nasynchronously (the first one via the listener bus *and* an async local RPC,\r\nthe second via its own separate internal message queue). This led to\r\nsituations where they disagreed about which executors were really alive; the\r\nchange makes it so the heartbeat receiver is updated first, and once that's\r\ndone, then the DAG scheduler can update itself. This ensures the hearbeat\r\nreceiver knows which executors not to ask to re-register.\r\n\r\nThe third one is because the block manager couldn't differentiate between\r\nan unknown executor (like one that's been removed) and an executor that needs\r\nto re-register (like one the scheduler decided to unregister because of\r\ntoo many fetch failures). The change adds code in the block manager master to\r\ntrack which executors have been removed, so that instead of asking them to\r\nre-register, it just ignores them.\r\n\r\nWhile there I simplified the executor shutdown a bit since it was doing\r\nsome stuff unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nTested with existing unit tests, and by repeatedly running workloads on k8s\r\nwith dynamic allocation; previously I'd hit these different issues somewhat\r\noften, with the fixes I'm not able to reproduce them.","created_at":"2019-11-21T21:18:34Z","updated_at":"2021-06-20T12:25:40Z","closed_at":"2020-08-26T22:14:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a917cf6df76b22cb47e310a95feed04cc3e69ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSupport columnar pruning through non-deterministic expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn some cases, columns can still be pruned even though nondeterministic expressions appears.\r\ne.g. for the plan  `Filter('a = 1, Project(Seq('a, rand() as 'r), LogicalRelation('a, 'b)))`, we shall still prune column b while non-deterministic expression appears. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test file: `ScanOperationSuite`.\r\nAdded test in `FileSourceStrategySuite` to verify the right prune behavior for both DS v1 and v2.","created_at":"2019-11-21T16:29:53Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T07:48:39Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T07:37:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4b3ebc42fec76af87cd507c03fb4cecbe9238ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26629/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26629/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26629/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f86cb82de6fb1ee9550b3c266eb9b3fb0019909f","head":{"label":"Ngone51:SPARK-29768","ref":"SPARK-29768","sha":"f86cb82de6fb1ee9550b3c266eb9b3fb0019909f","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr is to add a new config only for an optional INTERVAL clause. In the master, this feature is enabled when `spark.sql.ansi.enabled`=true. This pr proposes to split off the optional interval flag from `spark.sql.ansi.enabled`.\r\n\r\nThis comes from the @cloud-fan suggestion: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26584#discussion_r347939499\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nActually, an INTERVAL keyword is not optional in the ANSI/SQL standard.\r\n```\r\n<interval literal> ::=\r\n  INTERVAL [ <sign> ] <interval string> <interval qualifier>\r\n\r\n<interval string> ::=\r\n  <quote> <unquoted interval string> <quote>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nModify `UTF8String.toInt/toLong` to support trim spaces for both sides before converting it to byte/short/int/long.  \r\n\r\nWith this kind of \"cheap\" trim can help improve performance for casting string to integrals. The idea is from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24872#issuecomment-556917834\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nmake the behavior consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nyes, cast string to an integral type, and binary comparison between string and integrals will trim spaces first. their behavior will be consistent with float and double. \r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. add ut.\r\n2. benchmark tests\r\n the benchmark is modified based on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24872#issuecomment-503827016\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n/*\r\n * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n * contributor license agreements.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims the followings.\r\n- Add two profiles, `hive-1.2` and `hive-2.3` (default)\r\n- Validate if we keep the existing combination at least. (Hadoop-2.7 + Hive 1.2 / Hadoop-3.2 + Hive 2.3).\r\n\r\nFor now, we assumes that `hive-1.2` is explicitly used with `hadoop-2.7` and `hive-2.3` with `hadoop-3.2`. The followings are beyond the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n- SPARK-29988 Adjust Jenkins jobs for `hive-1.2/2.3` combination\r\n- SPARK-29989 Update release-script for `hive-1.2/2.3` combination\r\n- SPARK-29991 Support `hive-1.2/2.3` in PR Builder\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will help to switch our dependencies to update the exposed dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is a dev-only change that the build profile combinations are changed.\r\n- `-Phadoop-2.7` => `-Phadoop-2.7 -Phive-1.2`\r\n- `-Phadoop-3.2` => `-Phadoop-3.2 -Phive-2.3`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the dependency check and tests to make it sure we don't change anything for now.\r\n\r\n- [Jenkins (-Phadoop-2.7 -Phive-1.2)](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/114192/consoleFull)\r\n- [Jenkins (-Phadoop-3.2 -Phive-2.3)](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/114192/consoleFull)\r\n\r\nAlso, from now, GitHub Action validates the following combinations.\r\n![gha](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9700541/69355365-822d5e00-0c36-11ea-93f7-e00e5459e1d0.png)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-21T03:45:31Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T13:09:07Z","closed_at":"2019-11-23T18:02:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36480517e5bb12500088f2ddb320baab1912f759","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f93742a311c594cecbf404c495aed23afb22c381","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-29981","ref":"SPARK-29981","sha":"f93742a311c594cecbf404c495aed23afb22c381","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"74cb1ffd686d67188a4540c74c6111affd6cce90","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHere is a case, let see how it goes in different SQL engines.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect cast('1 ' as int) as v1, '1 ' = 1 as v2\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### spark 1.6\r\n`NULL\ttrue`\r\n#### spark 2.1\r\n`NULL\ttrue`\r\n#### spark 2.2\r\n`NULL\tNULL`\r\n#### spark 2.3\r\n`NULL\tNULL`\r\n#### spark 2.4\r\n`NULL\tNULL`\r\n#### hive\r\n`NULL\ttrue`\r\n#### PostgreSQL\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npostgres=# select cast('1 ' as int) as v1, '1 ' = 1 as v2;\r\n v1 | v2\r\n----+----\r\n  1 | t\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n#### presto\r\n```sql\r\npresto> select cast('1 ' as int) as v1, '1 ' = 1 as v2;\r\nQuery 20191120_060530_00002_f5kcs failed: line 1:38: '=' cannot be applied to varchar(2), integer\r\nselect cast('1 ' as int) as v1, '1 ' = 1 as v2\r\n\r\npresto> select cast('1 ' as int) as v1, '1 ' = '1 ' as v2;\r\nQuery 20191120_060545_00003_f5kcs failed: Cannot cast '1 ' to INT\r\n```\r\nOur behavior is unstable because type coercion changed since 2.2.\r\nPersonally, I think what PostgreSQL and Presto does here is more reasonable and consistent\r\n\r\nCurrently, this pull request obeys PostgreSQL, might need further discussion against this behavior change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better dirty data auto handling, keep consistency with older version sparks\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nYes, string will be trim at both ends before casting and compared to numerics\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nad

If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently from history server, we will not able to access the pool info, as we aren't writing pool information to the event log other than pool name. Already spark is hiding pool table when accessing from history server. But from the pool column in the stage table will redirect to the pools table, and that will throw error when accessing the pools page. To prevent error page, we need to hide the pool column also in the stage table\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR add an optional spark conf for speculation to allow speculative runs for stages where there are only a few tasks.\r\n```\r\nspark.speculation.task.duration.threshold\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf provided, tasks would be speculatively run if the TaskSet contains less tasks than the number of slots on a single executor and the task is taking longer time than the threshold.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change helps avoid scenarios where there is single executor that could hang forever due to disk issue and we unfortunately assigned the single task in a TaskSet to that executor and cause the whole job to hang forever.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nyes. If the new config `spark.speculation.task.duration.threshold` is provided and the TaskSet contains less tasks than the number of slots on a single executor and the task is taking longer time than the threshold, then speculative tasks would be submitted for the running tasks in the TaskSet.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests are added to TaskSetManagerSuite.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-21T00:05:00Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T16:53:10Z","closed_at":"2019-12-10T20:44:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc34611d9c28844273e19a73e0f897f649a03a36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI propose to add a test from the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/a9365221133caadffbbbbce1aae1ace799a588a3 for 2.4. I extended the test by a few more lengths of requested field to cover more code branches in Jackson Core. In particular, [the optimization](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5eb8973f871fef557fb4ca3f494406ed676a431a/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/jsonExpressions.scala#L473-L476) calls Jackson's method https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/42b8b566845e8f8d77537f51187a439029ed9bff/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/json/UTF8JsonGenerator.java#L742-L746 where the internal buffer size is **8000**. In this way:\r\n- 2000 to check 2000+2000+2000 < 8000\r\n- 2800 from the 2.4 commit. It covers the specific case: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/42b8b566845e8f8d77537f51187a439029ed9bff/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/json/UTF8JsonGenerator.java#L746\r\n- 8000-1, 8000, 8000+1 are sizes around the size of the internal buffer\r\n- 65535 to test an outstanding large field.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be sure that the current implementation and future versions of Spark don't have the bug fixed in 2.4.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `JsonFunctionsSuite`.","created_at":"2019-11-20T17:38:26Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:41:53Z","closed_at":"2019-11-21T01:00:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9512c798659418c2595595758f60d641bdb7e509","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f19de6302b99050d19aace02de0bde85ff774d88","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:json_tuple-test","ref":"json_tuple-test","sha":"f19de6302b99050d19aace02de0bde85ff774d88","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nallow the sql test files to specify different dimensions of config sets during testing. For example,\r\n```\r\n--CONFIG_DIM1 a=1\r\n--CONFIG_DIM1 b=2,c=3\r\n\r\n--CONFIG_DIM2 x=1\r\n--CONFIG_DIM2 y=1,z=2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example defines 2 config dimensions, and each dimension defines 2 config sets. We will run the queries 4 times:\r\n1. a=1, x=1\r\n2. a=1, y=1, z=2\r\n3. b=2, c=3, x=1\r\n4. b=2, c=3, y=1, z=2\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently `SQLQueryTestSuite` takes a long time. This is because we run each test at least 3 times, to check with different codegen modes. This is not necessary for most of the tests, e.g. DESC TABLE. We should only check these codegen modes for certain tests.\r\n\r\nWith the --CONFIG_DIM directive, we can do things like: test different join operator(broadcast or shuffle join) X different codegen modes.\r\n\r\nAfter reducing testing time, we should be able to run thrifter server SQL tests with config settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\ntest

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a new conf named `spark.shuffle.mapStatus.compression.codec` for user to decide which codec should be used(default by `zstd`) for `MapStatus` compression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe already have this functionality for `broadcast`/`rdd`/`shuffle`/`shuflleSpill`, \r\nso it might be better to have the same functionality for `MapStatus` as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, user now could use `spark.shuffle.mapStatus.compression.codec` to decide which codec should be used during `MapStatus` compression.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-20T16:54:26Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T23:24:44Z","closed_at":"2019-11-25T05:21:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab1d1e1f2c1d45f4c1fc3fbcc57973a467b3a9a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

needed?\r\n\r\nWe need to carefully manage the ownership / lifecycle of `ByteBuf` instances so we don't leak any of these.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd an optional parameter to the staticPageRank computation with the result of a previous PageRank computation. This would make the algorithm start from a different starting point closer to the convergence configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29877\r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful to have the possibility, when computing staticPageRank to use a previous computation as a checkpoint to continue the iterations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, it allows to start the static  page Rank computation from the point where an earlier one finished.\r\n\r\nExample: Compute 10 iteration first, and continue for 3 more iterations\r\n```scala\r\nval partialPageRank = graph.ops.staticPageRank(numIter=10, resetProb=0.15)\r\nval continuationPageRank = graph.ops.staticPageRank(numIter=3,  resetProb=0.15, Some(partialPageRank))\r\n ```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nYes, some tests were added.\r\nTesting was done as follow:\r\n- Check how many iterations it takes for a static Page Rank computation to converge\r\n- Run the static Page Rank computation for half of these iterations and take result as checkpoint\r\n- Restart computation and check that number of iterations it takes to converge. It never has to be larger than the original one and in most of the cases it is much smaller.\r\n\r\nDue to the presence of sinks and the normalization done in [[SPARK-18847]] it is not exactly equivalent to compute static page rank for 2 iterations, take the result at checkpoint and run for 2 more iterations than to compute directly for 4 iterations.\r\n\r\nHowever this checkpointing can give the algorithm a hint about the true distribution of pageRanks in the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen a task fails with OOM exception, the UnsafeInMemorySorter.array could be null. In the meanwhile, the cleanupResources() on task completion would call UnsafeInMemorySorter.getMemoryUsage in turn, and that lead to another NPE thrown.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCheck if array is null in UnsafeInMemorySorter.getMemoryUsage and it should help to avoid NPE.\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt was tested manually.","created_at":"2019-11-20T08:10:27Z","updated_at":"2019-11-21T00:18:36Z","closed_at":"2019-11-21T00:18:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea891b775147bd25946495a469fdfc06cc63765a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nNow resolve logic plan will load table twice which are in ResolveTables and ResolveRelations. The ResolveRelations is old code path, and ResolveTables is v2 code path, and the reason why load table twice is that ResolveTables will load table and rollback v1 table to ResolveRelations code path.\r\nThe same scene also exists in ResolveSessionCatalog.\r\n\r\nIt affect that execute command will cost double time than spark 2.4.\r\n\r\nHere is the idea that add a table version method in TableCatalog, and rules should always get table version firstly without load table.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Implement a custom error policy that is tolerant to a zookeeper connection suspension.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs described in [SPARK-29861](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29861), the recovery process of Spark (standalone) master in HA with zookeeper took about 1-2 minutes. During this time no spark master is active, which makes interaction with spark essentially impossible.\r\n\r\nJustification for the changes:\r\n1. because the spark master election does not properly restart if there are still open zookeeper connections\r\n2. as a precondition for 3\r\n3. to not restart spark when the connection is suspended temporarily, but only if it is really closed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n* Set up spark with two masters in standalone mode and zookeeper\r\n* Kill active master\r\n* Observe that the second master takes over immediately (within a few milliseconds)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-19T11:58:45Z","updated_at":"2020-03-29T00:10:58Z","closed_at":"2020-03-29T00:10:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"653b47d5dee8c82c2275609520e5d4f9d860adb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSummarizer support more metrics: sum, std\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThose metrics are widely used, it will be convenient to directly obtain them other than a conversion.\r\nin `NaiveBayes`: we want the sum of vectors,  mean & weightSum need to computed then multiplied\r\nin `StandardScaler`,`AFTSurvivalRegression`,`LinearRegression`,`LinearSVC`,`LogisticRegression`: we need to obtain `variance` and then sqrt it to get std\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor a literal number with an exponent(e.g. 1e-45, 1E2), we'd parse it to Double by default rather than Decimal. And user could still use  `spark.sql.legacy.exponentLiteralToDecimal.enabled=true` to fall back to previous behavior. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAccording to ANSI standard of SQL, we see that the (part of) definition of `literal` :\r\n\r\n```\r\n<approximate numeric literal> ::=\r\n    <mantissa> E <exponent> \r\n```\r\nwhich indicates that a literal number with an exponent should be approximate numeric(e.g. Double) rather than exact numeric(e.g. Decimal). \r\n\r\nAnd when we test Presto, we found that Presto also conforms to this standard: \r\n\r\n```\r\npresto:default> select typeof(1E2);\r\n _col0\r\n--------\r\n double\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npresto:default> select typeof(1.2);\r\n    _col0\r\n--------------\r\n decimal(2,1)\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also find that, actually, literals like `1E2` are parsed as Double before Spark2.1, but changed to Decimal after #14828 due to *The difference between the two confuses most users* as it said. But we also see support(from DB2 test) of original behavior at #14828 (comment).\r\n\r\nAlthough, we also see that PostgreSQL has its own implementation: \r\n\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select pg_typeof(1E2);\r\n pg_typeof \r\n-----------\r\n numeric\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\npostgres=# select pg_typeof(1.2);\r\n pg_typeof \r\n-----------\r\n numeric\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe still think that Spark should also conform to this standard while considering SQL standard and Spark own history and majority DBMS and also user experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nFor `1E2`, before this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select 1E2\")\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [1E+2: decimal(1,-2)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select 1E2\")\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [100.0: double]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd for `1E-45`, before this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\ndecimal can only support precision up to 38\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect 1E-45\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parse(ParseDriver.scala:131)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkSqlParser.parse(SparkSqlParser.scala:48)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parsePlan(ParseDriver.scala:76)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession.$anonfun$sql$1(SparkSession.scala:605)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.QueryPlanningTracker.measurePhase(QueryPlanningTracker.scala:111)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession.sql(SparkSession.scala:605)\r\n  ... 47 elided\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select 1E-45\");\r\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [1.0E-45: double]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd before this PR, user may feel super weird to see that `select 1e40` works but `select 1e-40 fails`. And now, both of them work well.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nupdated `literals.sql.out` and `ansi/literals.sql.out`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHadoop jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12911\r\nIn this jira, the author said to replace origin Apache Directory project which is not maintained (but not said it won't work well in jdk11) to Apache Kerby which is java binding(fit java version).\r\n\r\nAnd in Flink: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/9622\r\nAuthor show the reason why hadoop-2.7.2's  `MminiKdc` failed with jdk11.\r\nBecause new encryption types of `es128-cts-hmac-sha256-128` and `aes256-cts-hmac-sha384-192` (for Kerberos 5) enabled by default were added in Java 11. \r\nSpark with `hadoop-2.7's MiniKdc`does not support these encryption types and does not work well when these encryption types are enabled, which results in the authentication failure.\r\n\r\nAnd when I test hadoop-2.7.2's minikdc in local, the kerberos 's debug error message is  read message stream failed, message can't match. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`DataFrameNaFunctions.fill` doesn't handle duplicate columns even when column names are not specified.\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nval left = Seq((\"1\", null), (\"3\", \"4\")).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\nval right = Seq((\"1\", \"2\"), (\"3\", null)).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\nval df = left.join(right, Seq(\"col1\"))\r\ndf.printSchema\r\ndf.na.fill(\"hello\").show\r\n```\r\nproduces\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- col1: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: string (nullable = true)\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Reference 'col2' is ambiguous, could be: col2, col2.;\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.package$AttributeSeq.resolve(package.scala:259)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan.resolveQuoted(LogicalPlan.scala:121)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.resolve(Dataset.scala:221)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.col(Dataset.scala:1268)\r\n```\r\nThe reason for the above failure is that columns are looked up with `DataSet.col()` which tries to resolve a column by name and if there are multiple columns with the same name, it will fail due to ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `DataFrameNaFunctions.fill` such that if the columns to fill are not specified, it will resolve ambiguity gracefully by applying `fill` to all the eligible columns. (Note that if the user specifies the columns, it will still continue to fail due to ambiguity).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf column names are not specified, `fill` should not fail due to ambiguity since it should still be able to apply `fill` to the eligible columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the above example displays the following:\r\n```\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n|col1| col2| col2|\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n|   1|hello|    2|\r\n|   3|    4|hello|\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

RULES\r\n#### 1. The table shows how each unit converts to `CalendarInterval`'s `months`, `days` and `microseconds`.\r\n| Unit | TO | Rounding mode| Example|Notes|\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n|year| months only| ROUND_DOWN | `1.41 year = 1 years 4 months`,  `1.42 year = 1 years 5 months`| only the integral part of the total years * 30 will be used in months, the rest will be omitted|\r\n| month | months| NO | |the month's integral part will be added exactly to months\r\n| month | days |NO||the factional of months * 30, and the integral of this result will be added exactly to days\r\n|month| microseconds|  java.lang.Math.round| `1.1333333333301 months = 1 months 3 days 23 hours 59 minutes 59.999992 seconds`|the rest part will be added to microseconds |\r\n|week| days |NO||| total weeks * 7, and the integral of the result will be added exactly to days\r\n|week|microseconds|  java.lang.Math.round|`2.13333333 week = 14 days 22 hours 23 minutes 59.997984 seconds` |the rest part will be added to microseconds\r\n|day| days|NO|||the day's integral part will be added exactly to months\r\n|day|microseconds|java.lang.Math.round| | the rest of day will be added to microseconds\r\n|hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond|microseconds|java.lang.Math.round| | all these unit value go to microseconds|\r\n\r\n#### 2. Additional RULES\r\n2.1. ROUNDING for microseconds happens in each value-unit, not at the end, `0.0004 millisecond 0.4 microseconds` should be 0 not 1 microsecond, for example,\r\n```sql\r\npostgres=# select interval '0.0004 millisecond 0.4 microseconds';\r\n interval\r\n----------\r\n 00:00:00\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\npostgres=# select interval '0.001 millisecond 0.4 microseconds';\r\n    interval\r\n-----------------\r\n 00:00:00.000001\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n2.2 When `seconds` value is decimal, the millisecond and microsecond cannot be decimal, I have no reason to support this at the cost for performance and making the parsing logic more complex.\r\n```\r\nselect interval '0.1111111 seconds 2 microseconds';\r\nERROR:  invalid input syntax for type interval: \"0.1111111 seconds 2 microseconds\"\r\nLINE 1: select interval '0.1111111 seconds 2 microseconds';\r\n\r\npostgres=# select interval '1 seconds 2.1 microseconds';\r\n    interval\r\n-----------------\r\n 00:00:01.000002\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n2.3 0.5 microsecond round to 0 in PostgreSQL, but 1 in Spark due to different round policy supported by the host language I guess.\r\n\r\nThis PR closes #26314, which has performance regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn PostgreSQL, interval field values can have fractional parts. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes\r\n1. add fraction input support for interval values\r\n2. NO nanosecond out of range exception, round silently.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n##### 1. add unit tests\r\n##### 2. benchmark test, with a modified benchmark test which adds several fraction second value.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26592/files#diff-c02ae27cf4adc93f30d4a13839aa6bbaR85-R89\r\nIt is supported by master and this fix, then we can equally see the difference. only 2~3% performace loss here.\r\n###### master(before)\r\n```java\r\n[info] Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_231-b11 on Mac OS X 10.15.1\r\n[info] Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5287U CPU @

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen implementing a ScanBuilder, we require the implementor to provide the schema of the data and the number of partitions.\r\n\r\nHowever, when someone is implementing WriteBuilder we only pass them the schema, but not the number of partitions. This is an asymetrical developer experience.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a PhysicalWriteInfo interface that is passed to createBatchWriterFactory and createStreamingWriterFactory that adds the number of partitions of the data that is going to be written.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPassing in the number of partitions on the WriteBuilder would enable data sources to provision their write targets before starting to write. For example:\r\n\r\nit could be used to provision a Kafka topic with a specific number of partitions\r\nit could be used to scale a microservice prior to sending the data to it\r\nit could be used to create a DsV2 that sends the data to another spark cluster (currently not possible since the reader wouldn't be able to know the number of partitions)\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch prevents the cleanup operation in FileStreamSource if the source files belong to the FileStreamSink. This is needed because the output of FileStreamSink can be read with multiple Spark queries and queries will read the files based on the metadata log, which won't reflect the cleanup.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the logic, the patch only takes care of the case of when the source path without glob pattern refers to the output directory of FileStreamSink, via checking FileStreamSource to see whether it leverages metadata directory or not to list the source files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, if end users turn on cleanup option with the path which is the output of FileStreamSink, there may be out of sync between metadata and available files which may break other queries reading the path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to show different warning message when the pinned thread mode is enabled:\r\n\r\nWhen enabled:\r\n\r\n> PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD feature is enabled. However, note that it cannot inherit the local properties from the parent thread although it isolates each thread on PVM and JVM with its own local properties.\r\n> To work around this, you should manually copy and set the local properties from the parent thread to the child thread when you create another thread.\r\n\r\nWhen disabled:\r\n\r\n> Currently, 'setLocalProperty' (set to local properties) with multiple threads does not properly work.\r\n> Internally threads on PVM and JVM are not synced, and JVM thread can be reused for multiple threads on PVM, which fails to isolate local properties for each thread on PVM.\r\n> To work around this, you can set PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD to true (see SPARK-22340). However, note that it cannot inherit the local properties from the parent thread although it isolates each thread on PVM and JVM with its own local properties.\r\n> To work around this, you should manually copy and set the local properties from the parent thread to the child thread when you create another thread.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, it shows the same warning message regardless of PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD being set.

issue here is that when Spark is downscaling the application and deletes\r\na few pod requests that aren't needed anymore, it may actually race with the\r\nK8S scheduler, who may be bringing up those executors. So they may have enough\r\ntime to connect back to the driver, register, to just be deleted soon after.\r\nThis wastes resources and causes misleading entries in the driver log.\r\n\r\nThe change (ab)uses the blacklisting mechanism to consider the deleted excess\r\npods as blacklisted, so that if they try to connect back, the driver will deny\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt also changes the executor registration slightly, since even with the above\r\nchange there were misleading logs. That was because the executor registration\r\nmessage was an RPC that always succeeded (bar network issues), so the executor\r\nwould always try to send an unregistration message to the driver, which would\r\nthen log several messages about not knowing anything about the executor. The\r\nchange makes the registration RPC succeed or fail directly, instead of using\r\nthe separate failure message that would lead to this issue.\r\n\r\nNote the last change required some changes in a standalone test suite related\r\nto dynamic allocation, since it relied on the driver not throwing exceptions\r\nwhen a duplicate executor registration happened.\r\n\r\nTested with existing unit tests, and with live cluster with dyn alloc on.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-19T00:28:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-18T02:44:46Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T21:37:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a113feeae11729f416996e5e189e57e13ff61046","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6f881451d4fb10d23aaa735919278cefe88c0c3","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-29950","ref":"SPARK-29950","sha":"e6f881451d4fb10d23aaa735919278cefe88c0c3","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26497#discussion_r345708065, Postgre dialect should not be affected by the ANSI mode config.\r\nDuring reran the existing tests, only the LEFT/RIGHT build-in SQL

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the `format()` method of `FastDateFormat` which accepts an instance of the `Calendar` type. This allows to adjust the `MILLISECOND` field of the calendar directly before formatting. I added new method `format()` to `DateTimeUtils.TimestampParser`. This method splits the input timestamp to a part truncated to seconds and the seconds fractional part. The calendar is initialized by the first part in normal way, and the last one is converted to a form appropriate for correctly formatting by `FastDateFormat` as the second fraction up to microsecond precision.\r\n\r\nI refactored `MicrosCalendar` by passing the number of digits from the fraction pattern as a parameter to the default constructor because it is used by the existing `getMicros()` and new one `setMicros()`. `setMicros()` is used to set the seconds fraction to calendar's `MILLISECOND` field directly before formatting. \r\n\r\nThis PR supports various patterns for seconds fractions from `S` up to `SSSSSS`. If the patterns has more than 6 `S`, the first 6 digits reflect to milliseconds and microseconds of the input timestamp but the rest digits are set to `0`.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes a bug of incorrectly formatting timestamps in microsecond precision. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nSeq(java.sql.Timestamp.valueOf(\"2019-11-18 11:56:00.123456\")).toDF(\"t\")\r\n  .select(to_json(struct($\"t\"), Map(\"timestampFormat\" -> \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS\")).as(\"json\"))\r\n  .show(false)\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n|json                              |\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n|{\"t\":\"2019-11-18 11:56:00.000123\"}|\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. The example above outputs:\r\n```scala\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n|json                              |\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n|{\"t\":\"2019-11-18 11:56:00.123456\"}|\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By new tests for formatting by different patterns from `S` to `SSSSSS` in `DateTimeUtilsSuite`\r\n- A test for `to_json()` in `JsonFunctionsSuite`\r\n- A roundtrp test for writing and reading back a timestamp in a CSV

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse JUnit assertions in tests uniformly, not JVM assert() statements.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nassert() statements do not produce as useful errors when they fail, and, if they were somehow disabled, would fail to test anything. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. The assertion logic should be identical.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove the special handling of the negative sign in the parser (interval literal and type constructor)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe negative sign is an operator (UnaryMinus). We don't need to handle it specially, which is kind of doing constant folding at parser side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe error message becomes a little different. Now it reports type mismatch for the `-` operator.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove error messages for unsupported data type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the spark reads the hive table and encounters an unsupported field type, the exception message has only one unsupported type, and the user cannot know which field of which table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```create view t AS SELECT STRUCT('a' AS `$a`, 1 AS b) as q;```\r\ncurrent:\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Cannot recognize hive type

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImpl Complement Naive Bayes Classifier as a `modelType` option in `NaiveBayes`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, it is a better choice for text classification: it is said in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#complement-naive-bayes) that 'CNB regularly outperforms MNB (often by a considerable margin) on text classification tasks.'\r\n2, CNB is highly similar to existing MNB, only a small part of existing MNB need to be changed, so it is a easy win to support CNB.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nyes, a new `modelType` is supported\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26418. This PR removed `CalendarInterval`'s `toString` with an unfinished changes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Ideally we should make each PR isolated and separate targeting one issue without touching unrelated codes.\r\n\r\n2. There are some other places where the string formats were exposed to users. For example:\r\n\r\n    ```scala\r\n    scala> sql(\"select interval 1 days as a\").selectExpr(\"to_csv(struct(a))\").show()\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    +--------------------------+\r\n    |to_csv(named_struct(a, a))|\r\n    +--------------------------+\r\n    |      \"CalendarInterval...|\r\n    +--------------------------+\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3.  Such fixes:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n     private def writeMapData(\r\n        map: MapData, mapType: MapType, fieldWriter: ValueWriter): Unit = {\r\n      val keyArray = map.keyArray()\r\n    + val keyString = mapType.keyType match {\r\n    +   case CalendarIntervalType =>\r\n    +    (i: Int) => IntervalUtils.toMultiUnitsString(keyArray.getInterval(i))\r\n    +   case _ => (i: Int) => keyArray.get(i, mapType.keyType).toString\r\n    + }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    can cause performance regression due to type dispatch for each map.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see 2. case above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-18T09:37:48Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:37Z","closed_at":"2019-11-19T00:11:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ddf68714a971fb28dae3a6254c1d6dd6332050c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eefd45733435f7afa851449605bbaf7d18ccf9e8","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-29783","ref":"SPARK-29783","sha":"eefd45733435f7afa851449605bbaf7d18ccf9e8","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd batching support in Alter table add partition flow. Also calculate new partition sizes faster by doing listing in parallel.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR split the the single createPartitions() call AlterTableAddPartition flow into smaller batches, which could prevent\r\n - SocketTimeoutException: Adding thousand of partitions in Hive metastore itself takes lot of time. Because of this hive client fails with SocketTimeoutException.\r\n\r\n- Hive metastore from OOM (caused by millions of partitions).\r\n\r\nIt will also try to gather stats (total size of all files in all new partitions) faster by parallely listing the new partition paths.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT. \r\nAlso tested on a cluster in HDI with 15000 partitions with remote metastore server.

This would allow implementers of V2 Datasources to guarantee that the incoming data during writes has a particular distribution of data in the partitions and that the number of partitions can be defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenges faced. \r\n1. Distribution requirements must be known before a table is created. Currently many SQL style commands including CTAS that involve creating a table are an awkward fit for the current implementation.  For example SupportsRead extends table.  A Better implementation may be to have the RequireTableDistribution interface to extend TableProvider but this will require piping \r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove an optimization in `json_tuple` which causes truncation of results for large requested string fields.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark 2.4 uses Jackson Core 2.6.7 which has a bug in copying string. This bug may lead to truncation of results in some cases. The bug has been already fixed by the commit https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/commit/554f8db0f940b2a53f974852a2af194739d65200 which is a part of Jackson Core since the version 2.7.7. Upgrading Jackson Core up to 2.7.7 or later version is risky. That's why this PR propose to avoid using the buggy methods of Jackson Core 2.6.7. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy new test added to `JsonFunctionsSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-17T20:02:46Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:41:51Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T07:32:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2fadc77267b19adac6457cb5999fed21fd646a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4fd00f509e65ffb9bbf04bdf014a27a3aa96a77","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-truncation-by-json_tuple-2.4","ref":"fix-truncation-by-json_tuple-2.4","sha":"f4fd00f509e65ffb9bbf04bdf014a27a3aa96a77","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd AlterNamespaceSetLocationStatement, AlterNamespaceSetLocation, AlterNamespaceSetLocationExec to make ALTER DATABASE (SET LOCATION) look up catalog like v2 commands. \r\nAnd also refine the code of AlterNamespaceSetProperties, AlterNamespaceSetPropertiesExec, DescribeNamespace, DescribeNamespaceExec to use SupportsNamespaces instead of CatalogPlugin for catalog parameter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same catalog/namespace resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, add \"ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET LOCATION\" whose function is same as \"ALTER DATABASE ... SET LOCATION\" and \"ALTER SCHEMA ... SET LOCATION\".\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-17T09:41:43Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T13:02:05Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T12:40:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1f4d37507f5d7b52229eff740b9085ce180f508","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26562/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26562/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26562/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ee8e0f9c110fb36d32e3448720b4aea60ea26ad","head":{"label":"fuwhu:SPARK-29859","ref":"SPARK-29859","sha":"1ee8e0f9c110fb36d32e3448720b4aea60ea26ad","user":{"login":"fuwhu","id":12389745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu","html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42981239,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjk4MTIzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"fuwhu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fuwhu","id":12389745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu","html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSwitch to rdd to avoid adaptive execution when reading first line, because it seems adaptive execution can insert a ShuffleMapStage after which the first line read is not necessarily the csv header anymore.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a workaround. It is not clear to me why adaptive exection inserts a shuffle stage when all we are doing is filtering and reading first line. If this is unwanted behavior then the fix should be in adaptive execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change spark can read csv files incorrectly when adaptive execution is turned on resulting in errors and/or data corruption.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me how reproduce issue in a unit test, because so far the issue only shows up with 6+ executors and decent sized files. This patch was only tested by rebuilding spark and re-running the steps as decribed in the jira and confirming the issue did not show up again.","created_at":"2019-11-16T22:43:21Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T21:47:14Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T21:47:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"485f03022ccb6946b04e07dfee060fd4d4bf77ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e876031c1d873d3793af7ee5f8914215e63e5db8","head":{"label":"tresata-opensource:feat-spark-29906","ref":"feat-spark-29906","sha":"e876031c1d873d3793af7ee5f8914215e63e5db8","user":{"login":"tresata-opensource","id":9121872,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjkxMjE4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9121872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource","html_url":"https://github.com/tresata-opensource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tresata-opensource/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tresata-opensource","id":9121872,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjkxMjE4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9121872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource","html_url":"https://github.com/tresata-opensource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tresata-opensource/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[[SPARK-29376] Upgrade Apache Arrow to version 0.15.1](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26133) upgrades to Arrow 0.15 at Scala/Java/Python. This PR aims to upgrade `SparkR` to use Arrow 0.15 API. Currently, it's broken.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it turns out that our Jenkins jobs (including PR builder) ignores Arrow test. Arrow 0.15 has a breaking R API changes at [ARROW-5505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5505) and we missed that. AppVeyor was the only one having SparkR Arrow tests but it's broken now.\r\n\r\n**Jenkins**\r\n```\r\nSkipped ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1. createDataFrame/collect Arrow optimization (@test_sparkSQL_arrow.R#25)\r\n- arrow not installed\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, Arrow throws OOM on AppVeyor environment (Windows JDK8) like the following because it still has Arrow 0.14.\r\n```\r\nWarnings -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1. createDataFrame/collect Arrow optimization (@test_sparkSQL_arrow.R#39) - createDataFrame attempted Arrow optimization because 'spark.sql.execution.arrow.sparkr.enabled' is set to true; however, failed, attempting non-optimization. Reason: Error in handleErrors(returnStatus, conn): java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n\tat java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.<init>(HeapByteBuffer.java:57)\r\n\tat java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocate(ByteBuffer.java:335)\r\n\tat org.apache.arrow.vector.ipc.message.MessageSerializer.readMessage(MessageSerializer.java:669)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.arrow.ArrowConverters$$anon$3.readNextBatch(ArrowConverters.scala:243)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is due to the version mismatch.\r\n```java\r\nint messageLength = MessageSerializer.bytesToInt(buffer.array());\r\nif (messageLength == IPC_CONTINUATION_TOKEN) {\r\n  buffer.clear();\r\n  // ARROW-6313, if the first 4 bytes are continuation message, read the next 4 for the length\r\n  if (in.readFully(buffer) == 4) {\r\n    messageLength = MessageSerializer.bytesToInt(buffer.array());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Length of 0 indicates end of stream\r\nif (messageLength != 0) {\r\n  // Read the message into the buffer.\r\n  ByteBuffer messageBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(messageLength);\r\n```\r\n After upgrading this to 0.15, we are hitting ARROW-5505. This PR upgrades Arrow version in AppVeyor and fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the AppVeyor.\r\n\r\nThis PR passed here.\r\n- https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/spark/builds/28909044\r\n\r\n```\r\nSparkSQL Arrow optimization: Spark package found in SPARK_HOME:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `io.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true` to the testing configuration for JDK11 because this is an officially documented requirement of Apache Arrow.\r\n\r\nApache Arrow community documented this requirement at `0.15.0` ([ARROW-6206](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5078)).\r\n> #### For java 9 or later, should set \"-Dio.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true\".\r\n> This fixes `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: sun.misc.Unsafe or java.nio.DirectByteBuffer.(long, int) not available`. thrown by netty.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter ARROW-3191, Arrow Java library requires the property `io.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible` to be set to true for JDK >= 9. After https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26133, JDK11 Jenkins job seem to fail.\r\n\r\n-

is a port SPARK-29644 to 2.4\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCorrected ShortType and ByteType mapping to SmallInt and TinyInt, corrected setter methods to set ShortType and ByteType as setShort() and setByte(). Changes in JDBCUtils.scala\r\nFixed Unit test cases to where applicable and added new E2E test cases in to test table read/write using ShortType and ByteType.\r\n\r\nProblems\r\n- In master in JDBCUtils.scala line number 547 and 551 have a problem where ShortType and ByteType are set as Integers rather than set as Short and Byte respectively.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase ShortType =>\r\n    (stmt: PreparedStatement, row: Row, pos: Int) =>\r\n    stmt.setInt(pos + 1, row.getShort(pos))\r\n    The issue was pointed out by @maropu\r\n\r\ncase ByteType =>\r\n    (stmt: PreparedStatement, row: Row, pos: Int) =>\r\n     stmt.setInt(pos + 1, row.getByte(pos))\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Also at line JDBCUtils.scala 247 TinyInt is interpreted wrongly as IntergetType in getCatalystType()\r\n``` case java.sql.Types.TINYINT => IntegerType ```\r\n\r\n- At line 172 ShortType was wrongly interpreted as IntegerType\r\n``` case ShortType => Option(JdbcType(\"INTEGER\", java.sql.Types.SMALLINT)) ```\r\n\r\n- All thru out tests, ShortType and ByteType were being interpreted as IntegerTypes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nGiven type should be set using the right type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n- User will now be able to create tables where dataframe contains ByteType when using JDBC connector in overwrite mode.\r\n- Users will see a SQL side table are created with the right data type. ShortType in spark will translate to smallint and ByteType to TinyInt on the SQL side. This will resulting in small size of db tables where applicable.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCorrected Unit test cases where applicable. Validated in CI/CD\r\nAdded/fixed test case in MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite.scala, PostgresIntegrationSuite.scala , MySQLIntegrationSuite.scala to\r\nwrite/read tables from dataframe with cols as shorttype and bytetype. Validated by manual as follows.\r\n```\r\n./build/mvn install -DskipTests\r\n./build/mvn test -Pdocker-integration-tests -pl

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR try to make sure the comparison results of  `compared by 8 bytes at a time` and `compared by bytes wise` in RecordBinaryComparator is *consistent*, by reverse long bytes if it is little-endian and using Long.compareUnsigned. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf the architecture supports unaligned or the offset is 8 bytes aligned, `RecordBinaryComparator` compare 8 bytes at a time by reading 8 bytes as a long.  Related code is\r\n```\r\n    if (Platform.unaligned() || (((leftOff + i) % 8 == 0) && ((rightOff + i) % 8 == 0))) {\r\n      while (i <= leftLen - 8) {\r\n        final long v1 = Platform.getLong(leftObj, leftOff + i);\r\n        final long v2 = Platform.getLong(rightObj, rightOff + i);\r\n        if (v1 != v2) {\r\n          return v1 > v2 ? 1 : -1;\r\n        }\r\n        i += 8;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it will compare bytes by bytes.  Related code is\r\n```\r\n    while (i < leftLen) {\r\n      final int v1 = Platform.getByte(leftObj, leftOff + i) & 0xff;\r\n      final int v2 = Platform.getByte(rightObj, rightOff + i) & 0xff;\r\n      if (v1 != v2) {\r\n        return v1 > v2 ? 1 : -1;\r\n      }\r\n      i += 1;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, on little-endian machine,  the result of *compared by a long value* and *compared bytes by bytes* maybe different. \r\n\r\nFor two same records, its offsets may vary in the first run and second run, which will lead to compare them using long comparison or byte-by-byte comparison, the result maybe different.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test cases in RecordBinaryComparatorSuite\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-15T16:57:46Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T00:23:28Z","closed_at":"2019-11-19T08:10:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fca62b655df2c018636ca154cae463a72f9b3650","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26548/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26548/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26548/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/753883d7f84552c7392295aa42f5023c0909c615","head":{"label":"WangGuangxin:binary_comparator","ref":"binary_comparator","sha":"753883d7f84552c7392295aa42f5023c0909c615","user":{"login":"WangGuangxin","id":1312321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTIzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1312321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin","html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163655040,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM2NTUwNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"WangGuangxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WangGuangxin","id":1312321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTIzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1312321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin","html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin/spark","description":"Apache
