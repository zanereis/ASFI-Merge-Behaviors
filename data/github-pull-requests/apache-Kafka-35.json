Description\r\n\r\nBrokers can respond to metadata requests with uninitialized metadata when they are starting up. The [NetworkClient](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/NetworkClient.java#L1187-L1191) detects this scenario and ignores the empty metadata so that it can be retried later. Unfortunately the KafkaAdminClient only detects empty metadata for [listConsumerGroups](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/KafkaAdminClient.java#L3369-L3371). The impact of this is that other metadata requests fail with incorrect errors when handling an uninitialized metadata response. For example describeTopics will throw an UnknownTopicOrPartitionException for topics that do exist in the cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the KafkaAdminClient to detect any MetadataResponse that contains an empty broker set and throws a StaleMetadataException, that enables the call to be automatically retried. For example `describeTopics`, `listTopics`, `describeCluster` and the clients own metadata fetches will now be retried if the returned brokers set is empty. Additionally any calls that rely on metadata using the AllBrokerStrategy or the PartitionLeaderStrategy. `listConsumerGroups` was already retrying and will continue to do so.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nI think the better long term solution here is to have the brokers respond with a specific error when their metadata is uninitialized. This would be a clearer signal to all clients instead of relying on the obscure empty brokers condition. That would be a larger change so I'd like some feedback on whether that's the direction we want to go.\r\n\r\nI don't think the StaleMetadataException is the perfect exception for the uninitialized metadata scenario but there was precedent for it already in `listConsumerGroups` so I went with that. Open to creating a new exception type if people would like or just making the message within more clear.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI wrote a unit test that proves `describeTopics` will now retry when it receives an empty metadata response. This same test fails with an UnknownTopicOrPartitionException without my change. I also patched one of the other test scenarios (describeProducers) to include brokers in its mock metadata response, because that test would fail otherwise now.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

javadocs for `commitAsync()` (w/o callback) say:\r\n```\r\n@throws org.apache.kafka.common.errors.FencedInstanceIdException \r\nif this consumer instance gets fenced by broker.\r\n```\r\n \r\nIf no callback is passed into `commitAsync()`, no offset commit callback invocation is submitted. However, we only check for a `FencedInstanceIdException` when we execute a callback. When the consumer gets fenced by another consumer with the same `group.instance.id`, and we do not use a callback, we miss the exception.\r\n\r\nThis change modifies the behavior to propagate the `FencedInstanceIdException` even if no callback is used. The code is kept very similar to the original consumer.\r\n\r\nWe also change the order - first try to throw the fenced exception, then execute callbacks. That is the order in the original consumer so it's safer to keep it this way.\r\n\r\nFor testing, we add a unit test that verifies that the `FencedInstanceIdException` is thrown in that case.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

Context\r\n\r\nTreats `KAFKA-16277 - CooperativeStickyAssignor does not spread topics evenly among consumer group`\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16277\r\n\r\n@ableegoldman :\r\n> I suspect the assignor could be making a better effort. Presumably what is happening is that during the phase where it attempts to re-assign previously-owned partitions back to their former owner, we make a pass over a sorted list of previously-owned partitions that is grouped by topic. The assignor will then assign partitions from this list one-by-one to its previous owner until it hits the expected total number of partitions. So in the scenario you describe, it's basically looping over (t1p0, t1p1, t1p2, t1p3...t1pN, t2p0, t2p1, t2p2...t2pN) and assigning the first N partitions to the first consumer, which would be everything from topic 1, then just dumping the remaining partitions – all of which belong to topic 2 – onto the new consumer. \r\n> The fix should be fairly simple – we just need to group this sorted list by partition, rather than by topic (ie t1p0, t2p0, t1p1, t2p1...t1pN, t2pN).\r\n\r\nTest strategy: \r\n- Update tests with new assignments. Looking at the new assignments, the topics are now balanced between consumers, ie when there are multiple topics, one consumer no longer holds all partitions for `topic1`, they are spread across multiple consumers.\r\n- Create new test that verifies consumers have an equal number of partitions from each topic as more consumers are added and removed\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n-

call to `onPartitionsLost` callback to release assignment when a consumer pro-actively leaves the group due to poll timer expired. \r\n\r\nWhen the poll timer expires, the member sends a leave group request (reusing same existing LEAVING state and logic), and then transitions to STALE to release it assignment and wait for the poll timer reset. Once both conditions are met, the consumer transitions out of the STALE state to rejoin the group. Note that while on this STALE state, the member is not part of the group so it does not send heartbeats.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes the fix to ensure that while STALE or in any other state where the member is not in the group, heartbeat responses that may be received are ignored.

noted by @ijuma [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka-site/pull/581#pullrequestreview-1890612525), the usual flow of updating the upgrade.html docs is to first do it in apache/kafka/trunk, then cherry-pick to the relative release branch and then copy into the kafka-site repo.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this was not done with a few commits updating the 3.6.1, 3.5.2 and 3.5.1, resulting in [kafka-site's latest upgrade.html](https://github.com/apache/kafka-site/blob/asf-site/36/upgrade.html) containing content that isn't here. This was caught [while we were adding the 3.7 upgrade docs](https://github.com/apache/kafka-site/pull/581).\r\n\r\nThis patch reconciles both files by taking the extra changes from `kafka-site` and placing them here. This was done by simply comparing a diff of both changes and taking the ones that apply.","created_at":"2024-02-21T10:49:12Z","updated_at":"2024-02-23T09:12:48Z","closed_at":"2024-02-22T09:39:58Z","merged_at":"2024-02-22T09:39:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"9402d525abe2d8bf844fc94c0fa03b250d3da618","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15406/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15406/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15406/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/6fac739a356bf1828760e866b7eeaab3ee68498e","head":{"label":"apache:reconcile-upgrade-html","ref":"reconcile-upgrade-html","sha":"6fac739a356bf1828760e866b7eeaab3ee68498e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

was only notifying listeners of the latest leader and epoch when the replica transition to a new state. This can result in the listener never getting notified if the registration happened after it had become a follower.\r\n\r\nThis problem doesn't exists for the active leader because the KRaft implementation attempts to notified the listener of the latest leader and epoch when the replica is the active leader.\r\n\r\nThis issue is fixed by notifying the listeners of the latest leader and

MetadataResponse version 12, the topic Name field was made nullable.

I'm hoping that my understanding here is correct, and that essentially a client can have these expectations:\r\n\r\n- At least one of the fields is always populated, no matter what.\r\n- If ErrorCode is none, both fields are always populated.\r\n\r\nSince there is no entity-wide \"about\", this is documented from the perspective of each field, in their respective \"about\" sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

makes the test simpler to enable KRaft later. \r\n\r\nIt's unclear why a custom authoriser had to be used in the first place based on the commit made this change and tests seem to work without it. The initial ACLs required by the tests are created with a super admin client instead of `AclAuthorizationAdmin` which is part of the custom authorizer. \r\n\r\n`IDEMPOTENT_WRITE` was added to the initial ACLs created in the SASL setup, because SSL and BaseAdmin tests that being extended or extending this class do not override the `configuredClusterPermissions` method therefore end up not matching the expected permissions set on the cluster initially. Overriding this method does not seem necessary otherwise.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

detailed description of your change,\r\ncurrent MetadataCache is partially (but not fully) immutable, thus read/write requires synchronization and led to high produce latency with large number of topics in a kafka cluster\r\nThis change improves performance of metadata cache read operation of native kafka producer with copy-on-write strategy\r\n\r\nWhat is copy-on-write strategy\r\nIt’s a solution to reduce synchronized lock contention by making the object immutable, and always create a new instance when updating, but since the object is immutable, read operation will be free from waiting, thus produce latency reduced significantly\r\n\r\nBesides performance, it can also make the metadata cache immutable from unexpected modification, reduce occurrence of code bugs due to incorrect synchronization \r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nAdd unit test to cover concurrent read/write\r\nRun in production, with large scale for over 3months \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

fixes an invalid transition (leaving->stale) that was discovered in the system tests. The underlying issue was that the poll timer expiration logic was blindly forcing a transition to stale and sending a leave group, without considering that the member could be already leaving. \r\nThe fix included in this PR ensures that the poll timer expiration logic, whose purpose is to leave the group, is only applied if the member is not already leaving. Note that it also fixes the transition out of the STALE state, that should only happen when the poll timer is reset. \r\n\r\nAs a result of this changes:\r\n- If the poll timer expires while the member is not leaving, the poll timer expiration logic is applied: it will transition to stale, send a leave group, and remain in STALE state until the timer is reset. At that point the member will transition to JOINING to rejoin the group. \r\n- If the poll timer expires while the member is already leaving, the poll timer expiration logic does not apply, and just lets the HB continue. Not that this would be the case of member in PREPARE_LEAVING waiting for callbacks to complete (needs to continue sending HB), or LEAVING (needs to send the last HB to leave).","created_at":"2024-02-14T20:20:35Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T10:59:05Z","closed_at":"2024-02-16T10:38:46Z","merged_at":"2024-02-16T10:38:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"14d5e170706be0b843d08147a1046fafb442f9be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5536940330,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSgcBKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ctr","name":"ctr","color":"554CC1","default":false,"description":"Consumer

consumer keeps a poll timer, which is used to ensure liveness of the application thread. The poll timer automatically updates while the `Consumer.poll(Duration)` method is blocked, while the newer consumer only updates the poll timer when a new call to `Consumer.poll(Duration)` is issued. This means that the kafka-console-consumer.sh tools, which uses a very long timeout by default, works differently with the new consumer, with the consumer proactively rejoining the group during long poll timeouts.\r\n\r\nThis change solves the problem by (a) repeatedly sending `PollApplicationEvents` to the background thread, not just on the first call of `poll` and (b) making sure that the application thread doesn't block for so long that it runs out of `max.poll.interval`.\r\n\r\nAn integration test is added to make sure that we do not rejoin the group when a long poll timeout is used with a low `max.poll.interval`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

connect suppressions are more permissive than necessary, because suppressions were added to the file and then not later removed. Most notably:\r\n\r\n* #10299 removed the WithTopicCreation test variants\r\n* KafkaConfigBackingStore got an overhaul in #11779 that split up a really large method, and I think solved several warnings at the same time.\r\n* The ParameterNumber restriction was relaxed from 10 to 13 during KIP-98\r\n* The ClassDataAbstraction restriction was relaxed from 20 to 25 in #4454\r\n* BooleanExpressionComplexity was relaxed from 4 to 5 in #2974\r\n* The NPathComplexity was never relaxed. I think the RestClient and RestServer are borderline, and happen to be safe right now.\r\n\r\nRecently PRs have been relaxing the global checkstyle limits instead of adding suppressions:\r\n* The ClassFanOutComplexity was relaxed from 50 to 52 in #15105\r\n* The MethodLength restriction was relaxed from 150 to 170 in #14290\r\n\r\nI noticed this lead to the DistributedHerder no longer needing a MethodLength suppression. While the heuristics are arbitrary, in the interest in preventing the \"code quality ratchet\" from slipping, I reverted those changes and added the necessary suppressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer

patch re-work the reconciliation state machine on the server side with the goal to fix a few issues that we have recently discovered.\r\n* When a member acknowledges the revocation of partitions (by not reporting them in the heartbeat), the current implementation may miss it. The issue is that the current implementation re-compute the assignment of a member whenever there is a new target assignment installed. When it happens, it does not consider the reported owned partitions at all. As the member is supposed to only report its own partitions when they change, the member is stuck.\r\n* Similarly, as the current assignment is re-computed whenever there is a new target assignment, the rebalance timeout, as it is currently implemented, becomes useless. The issue is that the rebalance timeout is reset whenever the member enters the revocation state. In other words, in the current implementation, the timer is reset when there are no target available even if the previous revocation is not completed yet.\r\n\r\nThe patch fixes these two issues by not automatically recomputing the assignment of a member when a new target assignment is available. When the member must revoke partitions, the coordinator waits. Otherwise, it recomputes the next assignment. In other words, revoking is really blocking now.\r\n\r\nThe patch also proposes to include an explicit state in the record. It makes the implementation cleaner and it also makes it more extensible in the future.\r\n\r\nThe patch also changes the record format. This is a non-backward compatible change. I think that we should do this change to cleanup the record. As KIP-848 is only in early access in 3.7 and that we clearly state that we don't plane to support upgrade from it, this is acceptable in my opinion.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

state stores are currently flushed at each commit, which may impact performance, especially for EOS (commit each 200ms).\r\nThe goal of this improvement is to flush global state stores only when the delta between the current offset and the last checkpointed offset exceeds a threshold.\r\nThis is the same logic we apply on local state store, with a threshold of 10.000 records.\r\nThe implementation replaces the flush based on time to a flush based on the delta. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

PR modifies the commit manager for improved retry logic & fixing bugs:\r\n- defines high level functions for each of the different types of commit: commitSync, commitAsync, autoCommitSync (used from consumer close), autoCommitAsync (on interval), autoCommitNow (before revocation).\r\n- moves retry logic to these caller functions, keeping a common response error handling that propagates errors that each caller functions retry as it needs. \r\n\r\nFixes the following issues:\r\n- auto-commit before revocation should retry with latest consumed offsets\r\n- auto-commit before revocation should only reset the timer once, when the rebalance completes\r\n- StaleMemberEpoch error (fatal) is considered retriable only when committing offsets before revocation, where it is retried with backoff if the member has a valid epoch. All other commits will fail fatally on stale epoch. Note that auto commit on the interval (autoCommitAsync) does not have any specific retry logic for the stale epoch, but will effectively retry on the next interval (as it does for any other fatal error) \r\n- fix duplicated and noisy logs for auto-commit","created_at":"2024-02-12T17:57:48Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T10:59:02Z","closed_at":"2024-02-21T10:08:38Z","merged_at":"2024-02-21T10:08:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"77ba06fa620ad9cc42af92f42354661308676135","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5536940330,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSgcBKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ctr","name":"ctr","color":"554CC1","default":false,"description":"Consumer
