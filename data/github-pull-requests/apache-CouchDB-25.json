as described in issue #1571, `rexi_server_sup` supervisor could die\r\nand restart. After it restarts `rexi_server_mon` would not respan rexi servers\r\nas it wouldn't notice `rexi_server_sup` went away and come back. That would\r\nleave the cluster in a disabled state.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, switch restart strategy to `rest_for_one`. In this case, if a\r\nchild at the top dies it will restart all the children below it in the list.\r\nFor example, if `rexi_server` dies, it will restart all the children. If\r\n`rexi_server_sup` dies, it will restart `rexi_server_mon`. And then on restart\r\n`rexi_server_mon` will properly spawn all the rexi servers.\r\n\r\nSame for the buffers, if `rexi_buffer_sup` dies, it will restart `rexi_buffer_mon`\r\nand on restart it will spawn buffers as expected.\r\n\r\nFixes:

data structure is a `[{Position, AttachmentLength}, ...]` proplist\r\nwhich keeps track of attachment lengths and it is used when calculating\r\nexternal data size of documents. `Position` is supposed to uniquely identify an\r\nattachment in a file stream. Initially it was just an integer file offset. Then,\r\nafter some refactoring work it became a list of `{Position, Size}` tuples.\r\n\r\nDuring the PSE work streams were abstracted such that each engine can supply\r\nits own stream implementation. The position in the stream then became a tuple\r\nthat looks like `{couch_bt_engine_stream,{<0.1922.0>,[{4267,21}]}}`. This was\r\nwritten to the file the `#leaf.atts` data structure. While still correct, it is\r\nunnecessarily verbose wasting around 100 bytes per attachment, per leaf.\r\n\r\nTo fix it use the disk serialized version of the stream position as returned\r\nfrom `couch_stream:to_disk_term`. In case of the default CouchDB engine\r\nimplementation, this should avoid writing the module name and the pid value for\r\neach attachment entry.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-15T19:46:20Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T21:05:56Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T21:05:54Z","merged_at":"2018-08-15T21:05:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"28ba48da5877a5d471253c1b587af7e3b3121fd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/861a3c06b82e8ccac29818e5a197c041c0269989","head":{"label":"cloudant:reduce-leaf-atts-key-size","ref":"reduce-leaf-atts-key-size","sha":"861a3c06b82e8ccac29818e5a197c041c0269989","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nWe need to be able to restart CouchDB from integration test suite.\r\nWe used to have this feature, but it was removed.\r\nThis PR brings this functionality back under `/_node/$node/_restart`.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. compile and start CouchDB using `dev/run`\r\n```\r\nmake && dev/run --admin=adm:pass\r\n```\r\n2. try to access new endpoint as non authenticated user (you shouldn't be able to)\r\n```\r\ncurl -s -X POST 127.0.0.1:35984/_node/node1@127.0.0.1/_restart\r\n```\r\n3. note number of ets tables on the node \r\n```\r\n curl -s -u adm:pass -X GET 127.0.0.1:35984/_node/node1@127.0.0.1/_system | jq '.ets_table_count'\r\n```\r\n4. trigger restart of the node (the call should succeed)\r\n```\r\ncurl -s -u adm:pass -X POST 127.0.0.1:35984/_node/node1@127.0.0.1/_restart\r\n```\r\n5. keep checking the number of ets tables on the node. The call should return `null` few times and then it should increase gradually. \r\n```\r\n curl -s -u adm:pass -X GET 127.0.0.1:35984/_node/node1@127.0.0.1/_system | jq '.ets_table_count'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-07T20:00:56Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T16:56:22Z","closed_at":"2018-08-16T16:56:18Z","merged_at":"2018-08-16T16:56:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"b847adb8450d2095e5a6e52139cd51694612ea03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/9be121334f2eb8d8f4c796eb5e355689d3758129","head":{"label":"cloudant:implement-node-restart","ref":"implement-node-restart","sha":"9be121334f2eb8d8f4c796eb5e355689d3758129","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nA database external size is growing on any operation with attachments.\r\n\r\nThe external size of a database defined as an uncompressed size of its content, so expectation would be that with updating or deleting a document's attachment the external size would change accordingly, i.e. increase or decrease to a size of the attachment.\r\n\r\nThe external size, however, _always_ growing and shrinks to the expected values only on a database compression.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi\r\n{\"ok\":true}\r\n$ curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/holder -d'{}'\r\n{\"ok\":true,\"id\":\"holder\",\"rev\":\"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\"}\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi | jq .sizes.external\r\n4\r\n$ curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/holder/keeper.bin?rev=1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d -H'Content-Type:application/octet-stream' --data-binary @data2K.bin\r\n{\"ok\":true,\"id\":\"holder\",\"rev\":\"2-9125078ed1a87fcfca3d32d0834e41c8\"}\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi | jq .sizes.external\r\n2052\r\n$ curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/holder/filler.bin?rev=2-9125078ed1a87fcfca3d32d0834e41c8 -H'Content-Type:application/octet-stream' --data-binary @data8K.bin\r\n{\"ok\":true,\"id\":\"holder\",\"rev\":\"3-eb058b53377ede2720530b6ff073813a\"}\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi | jq .sizes.external\r\n10244\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far everything goes as expected and external size is growing in sync with attachment sizes. Let's try to update big attachment with a smaller file and then just delete the document completely:\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/holder/filler.bin?rev=3-eb058b53377ede2720530b6ff073813a -H'Content-Type:application/octet-stream' --data-binary @data4K.bin\r\n{\"ok\":true,\"id\":\"holder\",\"rev\":\"4-e1ce5b2ae946a8a64f3503cb6d646686\"}\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi | jq .sizes.external\r\n14340\r\n$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/_compact\r\n{\"ok\":true}\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi | jq .sizes.external\r\n6148\r\n$ curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/holder?rev=4-e1ce5b2ae946a8a64f3503cb6d646686\r\n{\"ok\":true,\"id\":\"holder\",\"rev\":\"5-548de2faf802ebcca8de0c3ca3c32c09\"}\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi | jq .sizes.external\r\n6148\r\n$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/_compact\r\n{\"ok\":true}\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi | jq .sizes.external\r\n4\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nSurprisingly we don't have any tests for database info and I couldn't find an appropriate place to add new tests, so I just wrote a new test suite.\r\n```bash\r\n$ make eunit apps=couch suites=couch_db_info_tests\r\n...\r\n======================== EUnit ========================\r\nmodule 'couch_db_info_tests'\r\nApplication crypto was left running!\r\n

s]\r\n=======================================================\r\n  All 7 tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaturally Travis and Jenkins should pass too.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nWhile CouchDB itself supports older versions of erlang new integration test suite is written in Elixir which depend on Erlang at least version 19.0. If we are planing to merge the `elixir-suite` branch to master earlier used workaround to manually install Elixir in my opnion is no longer acceptable.\r\nThis PR adds a helper script to install elixir on following platforms:\r\n\r\n- debian jessie\r\n- centos 7\r\n- osx 10.10\r\n- freeBSD 12\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I was unable to debug the script in windows due to lack of access to windows machine and experience with Windows tooling.\r\n  \r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nLinux based distributions can be tested as follows\r\n\r\n### Debian\r\n\r\n1. Run docker container\r\n    ```\r\n    cd test/elixir\r\n    docker run -it -w /src  -v `pwd`:/src debian:latest bash\r\n    ```\r\n2. Execute following commands\r\n    ```\r\n    apt-get update && apt-get install wget unzip --yes\r\n    /src/configure\r\n    ```\r\n3. You should see\r\n    ```\r\n    Elixir 1.6.6 (compiled with OTP 19) \r\n    ==> OK\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### CentOS\r\n1. Run docker container\r\n    ```\r\n    cd test/elixir\r\n    docker run -it -w /src  -v `pwd`:/src centos:latest bash\r\n    ```\r\n2. Execute following commands\r\n    ```\r\n    yum -y install unzip\r\n    /src/configure\r\n    ```\r\n3. You should see\r\n    ```\r\n    Elixir 1.6.6 (compiled with OTP 19) \r\n    ==> OK\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### FreeBSD\r\n\r\nWe can test it only partially in docker. Here is the list of commands.\r\n\r\n1. Run docker container\r\n    ```\r\n    cd test/elixir\r\n    docker run -it -w /src  -v `pwd`:/src debian:latest bash\r\n    ```\r\n2. Execute following commands\r\n    ```\r\n    apt-get update && apt-get install wget unzip xz-utils --yes\r\n    echo 'echo BSD' > /bin/uname\r\n    /src/configure\r\n    ```\r\n3. You should see\r\n    ```\r\n    ===> Unpacked elixir package\r\n    /src/.erlang/build/txz/bin//erl: 29: exec: /src/.erlang/build/txz/erts-8.3.5.4/bin/erlexec: not found\r\n    ```\r\n4. Check that the following files exist\r\n    ```\r\n    ls /src/.erlang/build/txz/bin/erl\r\n    ls /src/.erlang/build/txz/erts-8.3.5.4/bin/erlexec\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis aims to enable CouchDB to run in an environment where OpenSSL MD5 hash operations are explicitly disallowed by the operating system, for example: when running in \"FIPS mode.\" Because CouchDB does not make use of MD5 hashes for cryptographic purposes, this workaround does not defeat the purpose of \"FIPS mode,\" provided that the system owner is aware of and consents to its use.\r\n\r\n## Approach \r\n- Add a module that selects the library to use for MD5 hash operations depending on a configure flag. If the flag is used, the module's functions use erlang:md5. If not, the functions use crypto:hash(md5, ...).\r\n- Add to configure and rebar scripts to provide the configure flag and define an environment variable when it is used.\r\n- Replace crypto:hash(md5, ...) calls with calls to functions in the new module.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make check`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nThis fixes the use case when data provider module for `couch_epi` is not a pure functional.\r\nTo illustrate the issue let's look at the following code:\r\n```\r\n-export([data/0]).\r\n\r\ndata() ->\r\n   config:get(\"some_section\").\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would want to regenerate dynamically compiled module when term returned from `data/0` is changed. However the previous implementation of `module` data provider was relying on `vsn` attribute of a module. Which is valid approach if the data term is hard coded in the module source.\r\n\r\nThis PR also renames `module` data provider into `static_module`.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=couch_epi\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-11T16:30:18Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T14:27:42Z","closed_at":"2018-08-08T14:27:38Z","merged_at":"2018-08-08T14:27:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"d98e3e1998e8d20bc580d495b82cc3a9b6c82dad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/7a2a39007284039fb2744aa441fa2fd73af23170","head":{"label":"cloudant:support-callback-module-data-provider","ref":"support-callback-module-data-provider","sha":"7a2a39007284039fb2744aa441fa2fd73af23170","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

This is a WIP, but it's functional enough for folks to run with, and there's a desire for new tests to be written in it. This isn't yet connected to `make check`, so I'm opening up this PR with the intention of merging as is to allow more folks to start diving in for porting the existing tests and creating new tests. We can streamline things a bit more and then get it properly connected in.\r\n\r\nCurrent status of running the `./test/elixir/run` command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n112 tests, 4 failures, 5 skipped

Overview\r\n\r\nIn case when CouchDB has a native query server enabled and we call an Erlang `map` function for the first time (therefore there is no view index) `couch_mrview_updater:start_update` calls `run(State, [<<\"map_doc\">> , Doc])` from the `couch_native_process` and after this view index is built and data is read from it. Unfortunately when the same Erlang map function is used for changes feed with `_view` filter, `couch_native_process` crashes with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"error\":\"error\",\"reason\":\"{{function_clause,\\n     \r\n[{couch_native_process,ddoc,\\n          [{evstate, \r\n```\r\n\r\nChanges feed with `_view` filter allows to use existing map function as the filter and it doesn’t query the view index files. Furthermore `seq_indexed` option doesn't work correctly in the mrview (more details in [this thread](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1142#issuecomment-378228093)) hence `fast_view` filter (which allows to use a dedicated `seq` and `keyseq` indexes) was disabled in the CouchDB 2. As a consequence changes feed with `_view` will always call `run(#evstate{ddocs=DDocs}=State, [<<\"ddoc\">>])` and this call will crash with the aforementioned error.\r\nThis crash is caused by a missing implementation of `ddoc` function for `<<\"views\">>` FunPath case, because for requests like `/_changes?style=all_docs&filter=_view&view=test/repl` the `FunPath` will be: `[<<\"views\">>,<<\"repl\">>,<<\"map\">>]`. For JS map functions this does work because in this case `couch_query_server` delegates map to an external `couch_js` OS process.\r\nThis fix effectively provides that missing `ddoc` clause and it is based on the `FilterFun` one but matches return values of the `erlang:put()` function (which is called from the native `Emit` function) and it also matches `ok` and `false` return values for the cases when docs were not emitted and Erlang view just returned either `ok` or a `false` atom. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`should_filter_by_erlang_view/1` test function was added to the `couch_changes_test.erl` test suite.\r\nKudos to @iilyak for it. \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-22T13:03:35Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T19:39:19Z","closed_at":"2018-06-29T19:37:49Z","merged_at":"2018-06-29T19:37:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"d36149ec3a0d071d067589c8f3fe7d263626948d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/0377e53ce82c758fe5ee16aa105639fc813a5c77","head":{"label":"Spotme:spotme/fix/couch-native-process","ref":"spotme/fix/couch-native-process","sha":"0377e53ce82c758fe5ee16aa105639fc813a5c77","user":{"login":"Spotme","id":673891,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY3Mzg5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/673891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme","html_url":"https://github.com/Spotme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"120903698e0689f0f021411fb4bdbb164a7ae77a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nThis modification allows to run compile on individual applications and makes compiler flag `bin_opt_info` optional to reduce amount of compiler's warnings as discussed [here](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1215#issuecomment-392826035)\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nStandard test suite should pass\r\n\r\nCommand `make apps=chttpd` should compile only `chttpd` application (may need to delete its `ebin` first to actually recompile)\r\n\r\nCommand `ERL_OPTS=bin_opt_info make apps=chttpd` should recompile `chttpd` with all compiler's warnings.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nDiscussion on #1215 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-14T13:31:28Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T12:22:21Z","closed_at":"2018-06-15T12:21:57Z","merged_at":"2018-06-15T12:21:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7d35c3133499fcb2f7989aea0c4c0e9277351f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/41decfa06147bf48f9ac30121cbe9ec02c23d5c7","head":{"label":"cloudant:make-bin_opt_info-optional","ref":"make-bin_opt_info-optional","sha":"41decfa06147bf48f9ac30121cbe9ec02c23d5c7","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nIn case when CouchDB has a native query server enabled and we call an Erlang `map` function for the first time (therefore there is no view index) `couch_mrview_updater:start_update` calls `run(State, [<<\"map_doc\">> , Doc])` from the `couch_native_process` and after this view index is built and data is read from it. Unfortunately when the same Erlang map function is used for changes feed with `_view` filter, `couch_native_process` crashes with:\r\n```\r\n{\"error\":\"error\",\"reason\":\"{{function_clause,\\n     [{couch_native_process,ddoc,\\n          [{evstate, ....\r\n```\r\nChanges feed with `_view` filter allows to use existing map function as the filter and it doesn’t query the view index files. Furthermore `seq_indexed` option doesn't work correctly in the mrview (more details in [this thread](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1142#issuecomment-378228093)) hence `fast_view` filter (which allows to use a dedicated `seq` and `keyseq` indexes) was disabled in the CouchDB 2. As a consequence changes feed with `_view` will always call `run(#evstate{ddocs=DDocs}=State, [<<\"ddoc\">>])` and this call will crash with the aforementioned error.\r\nThis crash is caused by a missing implementation of `ddoc` function for `<<\"views\">>` FunPath case, because for requests like `/_changes?style=all_docs&filter=_view&view=test/repl` the `FunPath` will be: `[<<\"views\">>,<<\"repl\">>,<<\"map\">>]`. For JS map functions this does work because in this case `couch_query_server` delegates map to an external `couch_js` OS process.\r\nThis fix effectively provides that missing `ddoc` clause and it is based on the `FilterFun` one but matches return values of the `erlang:put()` function (which is called from the native `Emit` function) and it also matches `ok` and `false` return values for the cases when docs were not emitted and Erlang view just returned either `ok` or a `false` atom. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nHere is a simple shell script which makes curl requests in order to populate a test db with dummy docs and design docs containing Erlang and JS `map` functions:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\n# creating the db\r\ncurl -u admin:admin1 -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1\r\n\r\n#insert ddoc with erlang view\r\ncurl -u admin:admin1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1/_design/test -d '{\"_id\":\"_design/test\",\"language\":\"erlang\",\"options\":{\"include_deleted\":true,\"include_design\":true},\"views\":{\"repl\":{\"map\":\"fun({Doc}) ->\\n    Repl = lists:keyfind(<<\\\"repl\\\">>, 1, Doc),\\n    if\\n         Repl =:= {<<\\\"repl\\\">>, <<\\\"unsafe\\\">>} ->\\n              ok;\\n         true ->\\n              DocId = case lists:keyfind(<<\\\"_id\\\">>, 1, Doc) of\\n                   {<<\\\"_id\\\">>, Id} -> Id;\\n                   false -> undefined\\n              end,\\n              Emit(DocId, null)\\n    end\\nend.\"}}}'\r\n\r\n#insert second ddoc with js view\r\ncurl -u admin:admin1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1/_design/testjs -d '{\"_id\":\"_design/testjs\", \"language\":\"javascript\",\"options\":{\"include_deleted\":true,\"include_design\":true},\"views\":{\"repl\":{\"map\":\"function (doc) {\\n\\tif (doc.repl !== \\\"unsafe\\\") emit(doc._id, null);\\n}\"}}}'\r\n\r\n#populate with 50 repl safe docs\r\nfor IDX in {1..50}; do curl -u admin:admin1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1 -d '{\"index\":\"'$IDX'\", \"repl\": \"safe\"}'; done\r\n\r\n#populate with 10 repl unsafe docs\r\nfor IDX in {51..60}; do curl -u admin:admin1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1 -d '{\"index\":\"'$IDX'\", \"repl\": \"unsafe\"}'; done\r\n\r\n#populate with 10 random docs\r\nfor IDX in {61..70}; do curl -u admin:admin1 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1 -d '{\"index\":\"'$IDX'\", \"data\": \"test\"}'; done\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to test just run changes feed for both JS map:\r\n```\r\ncurl -u admin:admin1 'http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1/_changes?style=all_docs&filter=_view&view=testjs/repl'\r\n```\r\nand Erlang one `filter=_view&view=test/repl` and compare the output including the `\"last_seq\"` which ought to be the same.

Overview\r\n\r\nOne bugfix and one enhancement here. The bugfix is that the `finalize` operation introduced for `_approx_count_distinct` was not being executed on view requests coming in through the non-clustered interface, so any attempt to use that reduce function there would crash.\r\n\r\nThe enhancement is to take advantage of that `finalize` operation to optimize the builtin `_stats` reduce function. Previously the reduce function would always write down an ejson form for the 5 statistical quantities to disk as it could never know whether the `rereduce` function was being called during indexing or during querying. Now that we have the `finalize` operation (which only runs at query time) we can store a more compact format on disk and avoid continuously translating back and forth between the compact and ejson formats during indexing. This should result in slightly more efficient builds and slightly smaller resulting indexes.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun the _stats tests against clustered and non-clustered interfaces.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is an user experience improvement. If a selector has a sort field set\r\nthen an index is only valid if the prefix of the sort fields match the \r\nprefix of the index fields. \r\n\r\ne.g Index = [A, B, C] with Sort = [A, B] is a valid sort\r\nbut if Sort = [B, C] then it is not valid for this index.\r\n\r\nIf an indexed field in the selector is constant, eg {A: {$eq: 21}} then\r\nwe can add it to the sort list because it won't affect sorting and the\r\noriginal sort will still be valid.\r\n\r\ne.g Index = [A, B] with Sort = [B] and selector has {A: 1}. \r\nThen we can make the Sort = [A, B].\r\nThe sort will work as expected and this will increase the possibility\r\nof the index being chosen. It also helps a user where they might not have\r\nput the correct initial fields in the sort.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nSee the tests in the PR for examples\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n-

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR implements clustered purge. Its big.\r\n\r\nThere are roughly five large chunks for clustered purge:\r\n\r\n1. Single shard APIs\r\n2. Updates to couch_mrview\r\n3. Internal replication\r\n4. Read-repair\r\n5. Clustered API\r\n\r\nAt the shard level the major changes are to add two new indexes for purge requests. These indexes store the history of purge requests to a shard (rather than the old method of just storing the most recent purge). This allows for secondary indices and internal replication to manage their eventual consistency. This is the bulk of the PR in that its adding both the implementation and a whole bunch of tests for clustered purge.\r\n\r\nOne note on naming internally and in commit notes is that a \"purge request\" is what's sent in a single HTTP request to the purge end point. A \"purge info\" is a single `{DocId, Revs}` entry. The new indexes in the shard deal with purge infos as they lose any notion of bundling from which request they came in after they're stored.\r\n\r\nThe changes to couch_mrview are fairly straightforward after the single node API changes. The only thing that will be interesting in this commit is how we use a _local doc to track where the secondary index has processed in the purge sequence. This is necessary so that compaction knows when it can discard purge infos.\r\n\r\nInternal replication is fairly straightforward. This update just ensures that we synchronize our purge infos between each shard so that we don't inadvertently undo a purge request when synchronizing shards.\r\n\r\nRead-repair is somewhat tricky. The thing to note here is that when we open a document we track which revisions came from which nodes. Then if read-repair is required we pass that information along with the update request. This way a node can filter out requests from any node that is either a) not up to date with its synchronization or b) we have explicitly purged a revision that has not been sent to the node from whence the revision came back. That last bit of logic may sound kind of odd but the thing to remember is that we could completely remove a revision from a cluster and then re-introduce it later on. This means that we have to reject re-application of a revision for a closed period of time (rather than rejecting it forever).\r\n\r\nThe clustered API is rather straightforward for anyone familiar any of the existing fabric coordinator and HTTPD handler code.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make check`\r\n\r\nClustered purge comes with some fairly extensive testing though I'm very much open for suggestions on new tests.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on:\r\n\r\n#1366 \r\n#1367 \r\n#1368 \r\n#1369\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1352\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly (hopefully ;)\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n\r\nFor docs this doesn't change the existing purge APIs but I will need to open a PR against the docs to write up some of the caveats and footgun warnings that we want to add for

PR updates the pluggable storage engine test suite so that its a self contained app to clean up code and various other odds and ends.\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that this also makes the tests go through couch_server instead of instantiating the engines directly. This allows a storage engine to open itself as a database which turned out to be necessary for compactions with purge so that we can enable code re-use without requiring every engine to correctly implement the get_minimum_purge_seq logic.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on #1366 and #1367.","created_at":"2018-06-01T17:26:35Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T19:46:26Z","closed_at":"2018-08-21T16:04:44Z","merged_at":"2018-08-21T16:04:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"c02f6d294d962d18c22d8179f43ee07add5437eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/e0c7ad386803dea20573201f4e6468bdae8294e1","head":{"label":"apache:COUCHDB-3326-clustered-purge-pr3-refactor-pse-tests","ref":"COUCHDB-3326-clustered-purge-pr3-refactor-pse-tests","sha":"e0c7ad386803dea20573201f4e6468bdae8294e1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nWe’ve seen a number of applications now where a user needs to count the number of unique keys in a view. Currently the recommended approach is to add a trivial reduce function and then count the number of rows in a _list function or client-side application code, but of course that doesn’t scale nicely.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in a majority of these cases all that’s required is an approximation of the number of distinct entries, which brings us into the space of hash sets, linear probabilistic counters, and the ever-popular “HyperLogLog” algorithm. Taking HLL specifically, this seems like quite a nice candidate for a builtin reduce. The size of the data structure is independent of the number of input elements and individual HLL filters can be unioned together. There’s already what seems to be a good MIT-licensed implementation on GitHub:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/GameAnalytics/hyper\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `_approx_count_distinct` function which uses the binary HLL implementation above. It has the precision fixed to 11 which yields a relative error of 2%. A future improvement would make this precision configurable in the design document.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Generate a view with a known number of distinct keys.\r\n2. Add `_approx_count_distinct` as a reduce function.\r\n3. Compare the reduce output with the exact number of distinct keys. The result should be within 2%.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-2971 for history.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written

Overview\r\n\r\nMango requires that a JSON index can only be used to fulfil\r\na query if the \"selector\" field covers all of the fields the\r\nindex. For example, if an index contains [\"a\", \"b\"] but the\r\nselector only requires field [\"a\"] to exist in the matching documents,\r\nthe index would not be valid for the query (because it only includes\r\ndocuments containing both \"a\" and \"b\").\r\n\r\nThere is a special case here around built-in fields; _id and _rev\r\nspecifically, because they are guaranteed to exist in any matching\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nIf a user declares an index [\"a\", \"_id\"], we can safely exclude \"_id\"\r\nfrom the index coverage check, so a selector of {\"a\": \"foo\"} should be\r\nable to use this index.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, a user would have to alter the selector so that\r\nit covered the \"_id\" field, e.g. {\"a\": \"foo\",\r\n\"_id\": {\"$exists\": true}}. The commit removes the need to explicitly\r\ncover _id or _rev fields in the query selector.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTests have been added to the Mango test suite. To manually test, create an index which includes `\"_id\"` and/or `\"_rev\"` and another field. Check that calling `_find` (or `_explain`) with a selector that does not include `\"_id\"` or `\"_rev\"` but does reference the other indexed fields will use the index.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or

Overview\r\n\r\nPer issue #927, creating a mango index with a malformed `fields` value will output an error message printing back the JSON binary string of `fields` as ASCII codes for each character (i.e., `<<\"foo\">>` prints as `<<102,111,111>>`. This fix prints `fields` in a readable way (`<<\"foo\">>`)  \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nHit your couch cluster with this request (reproducing #927):\r\n```\r\ncurl -v -X POST http://admin:abc123@localhost:6002/foo/_index -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"index\":{\"fields\":\"foo\"}}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing Results\r\n\r\nI tested the change with multiple invalid input values for `fields`, with these results:\r\n```\r\nRequest body: {\"index\":{\"fields\":\"foo\"}}\r\nResponse body: {\"error\":\"invalid_sort_json\",\"reason\":\"Sort must be an array of sort specs, not: <<\\\"foo\\\">>\"}\r\n\r\nRequest body: {\"index\":{\"fields\":{}}}\r\nResponse body: {\"error\":\"invalid_sort_json\",\"reason\":\"Sort must be an array of sort specs, not: {[]}\"}\r\n\r\nRequest body: {\"index\":{\"fields\":{\"blah\":\"foo\"}}}                                 \r\nResponse body: {\"error\":\"invalid_sort_json\",\"reason\":\"Sort must be an array of sort specs, not: {[{<<\\\"blah\\\">>,<<\\\"foo\\\">>}]}\"}                                     \r\n\r\nRequest body: {\"index\":{\"fields\":[{\"blah\":\"foo\"}]}}                               \r\nResponse body: {\"error\":\"invalid_sort_field\",\"reason\":\"Invalid sort field: {[{<<\\\"blah\\\">>,<<\\\"foo\\\">>}]}\"}\r\n\r\nRequest body: {\"index\":{\"fields\":[{\"blah\":{\"blah\":\"foo\"}}]}}                      \r\nResponse body: {\"error\":\"invalid_sort_field\",\"reason\":\"Invalid sort field: {[{<<\\\"blah\\\">>,{[{<<\\\"blah\\\">>,<<\\\"foo\\\">>}]}}]}\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or
