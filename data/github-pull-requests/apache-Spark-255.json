What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a long-standing bug and I've seen many people complaining about it in JIRA/dev list.\r\n\r\nA typical example:\r\n```\r\nval df1 = …\r\nval df2 = df1.filter(...)\r\ndf1.join(df2, df1(\"a\") > df2(\"a\")) // returns empty result\r\n```\r\nThe root cause is, `Dataset.apply` is so powerful that users think it returns a column reference which can point to the column of the Dataset at anywhere. This is not true in many cases. `Dataset.apply` returns an `AttributeReference` . Different Datasets may share the same `AttributeReference`. In the example above, `df2` adds a Filter operator above the logical plan of `df1`, and the Filter operator reserves the output `AttributeReference` of its child. This means, `df1(\"a\")` is exactly the same as `df2(\"a\")`, and `df1(\"a\") > df2(\"a\")` always evaluates to false.\r\n\r\nThe key problem here is, when analyzer resolves self-join by assigning new expr IDs to the conflicting attributes in the right side of the join, how can we map the Dataset column reference to the new attributes of the right side?\r\n\r\nThe proposal here is:\r\n1. each Dataset has a globally unique ID\r\n2. the `AttributeReference` returned by `Dataset.apply` carries the ID and column position(e.g. 3rd column of the Dataset) via metadata\r\n3. In `Dataset.join`, the left and right side of the join node carry the ID via `SubqueryAlias`.\r\n4. Add a new analyzer rule, which finds the special `AttributeReference`s that have dataset id, and traverses the logical plan to find the corresponding `SubqueryAlias` with the same dataset id, to get the actual `AttributeReference`.\r\n\r\nWhen analyzer resolves self-join, it transforms down the right side plan to find nodes like `MultiInstanceRelation` to generate attributes with new exprId. If the right side is a `SubqueryAlias`, its output will be the deduplicated `AttributeReference`s after self-join is resolved.\r\n\r\nWhen we resolve dataset column reference(`AttributeReference` with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDAGScheduler becomes a bottleneck in cluster when multiple JobSubmitted events has to be processed as DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop is single threaded and it will block other tasks in queue like TaskCompletion.\r\nThe JobSubmitted event is time consuming depending on the nature of the job (Example: calculating parent stage dependencies, shuffle dependencies, partitions) and thus it blocks all the events to be processed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in my cluster some jobs partition calculation is time consuming (Similar to stack at SPARK-2647) hence it slows down the spark DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop which results in user jobs to slowdown, even if its tasks are finished within seconds, as TaskCompletion Events are processed at a slower rate due to blockage.\r\n\r\nRefer: http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Spark-Scheduler-Spark-DAGScheduler-scheduling-performance-hindered-on-JobSubmitted-Event-td23562.html

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe code below currently infers as decimal but previously it was inferred as string.\r\n\r\n**In branch-2.4**, type inference path for decimal and parsing data are different.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2a8343121e62aabe5c69d1e20fbb2c01e2e520e7/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/csv/UnivocityParser.scala#L153\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c284c4e1f6f684ca8db1cc446fdcc43b46e3413c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/csv/CSVInferSchema.scala#L125\r\n\r\nSo the code below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.option(\"delimiter\", \"|\").option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\").csv(Seq(\"1,2\").toDS).printSchema()\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduced string as its type.\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- _c0: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In the current master**, it now infers decimal as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- _c0: decimal(2,0) (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt happened after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22979 because, now after this PR, we only have one way to parse decimal:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7a83d71403edf7d24fa5efc0ef913f3ce76d88b8/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/ExprUtils.scala#L92\r\n\r\n**After the fix:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- _c0: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to restore the previous behaviour back in `CSVInferSchema`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI want to get rid of as much use of `scala.language.existentials` as possible for 3.0. It's a complicated language feature that generates warnings unless this value is imported. It might even be on the way out of Scala: https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/proposal-to-remove-existential-types-from-the-language/2785\r\n\r\nFor Spark, it comes up mostly where the code plays fast and loose with generic types, not the advanced situations you'll often see referenced where this feature is explained. For example, it comes up in cases where a function returns something like `(String, Class[_])`. Scala doesn't like matching this to any other instance of `(String, Class[_])` because doing so requires inferring the existence of some type that satisfies both. Seems obvious if the generic type is a wildcard, but, not technically something Scala likes to let you get away with.\r\n\r\nThis is a large PR, and it only gets rid of _most_ instances of `scala.language.existentials`. The change should be all compile-time and shouldn't affect APIs or logic.\r\n\r\nMany of the changes simply touch up sloppiness about generic types, making the known correct value explicit in the code.\r\n\r\nSome fixes involve being more explicit about the existence of generic types in methods. For instance, `def foo(arg: Class[_])` seems innocent enough but should really be declared `def foo[T](arg: Class[T])` to let Scala select and fix a single type when evaluating calls to `foo`.\r\n\r\nFor kind of surprising reasons, this comes up in places where code evaluates a tuple of things that involve a generic type, but is OK if the two parts of the tuple are evaluated separately.\r\n\r\nOne key change was altering `Utils.classForName(...): Class[_]` to the more correct `Utils.classForName[T](...): Class[T]`. This caused a number of small but positive changes to callers that otherwise had to cast the result.\r\n\r\nIn several tests, `Dataset[_]` was used where `DataFrame` seems to be the clear intent.\r\n\r\nFinally, in a few cases in MLlib, the return type `this.type` was used where there are no subclasses of the class that uses it. This really isn't needed and causes issues for Scala reasoning about the return type.

EXPLAIN DESCRIBE TABLE t;\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Scan OneRowRelation[]\r\n```\r\nThis is not consistent with how we handle explain processing for other commands.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` logical type for timestamps written to parquet files. The type matches semantically to Catalyst's `TimestampType`, and stores microseconds since epoch in UTC time zone. This will allow to avoid conversions of microseconds to nanoseconds and to Julian calendar. Also this will reduce sizes of written parquet files.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy existing test

Pull Request to add datatables to stage page SPARK-21809 got merged. The search functionality in those datatables being a great improvement for searching through a large number of tasks, also performs search over the raw data rather than the formatted data displayed in the tables. It would be great if the search can happen for the formatted data as well.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded code to enable searching over displayed data in tables e.g. searching on \"165.7 MiB\" or \"0.3 ms\" will now return the search results. Also, earlier we were missing search for two columns in the task table \"Shuffle Read Bytes\" as well as \"Shuffle Remote Reads\", which I have added here.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual Tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-19T19:47:15Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T14:11:44Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T14:08:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cdeabbd636e2bcff16e77e674a9120258a82823","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/35f78c25681ebcf965c02abefe311617cc9c709d","head":{"label":"pgandhi999:SPARK-25719","ref":"SPARK-25719","sha":"35f78c25681ebcf965c02abefe311617cc9c709d","user":{"login":"pgandhi999","id":22228190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjI4MTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22228190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999","html_url":"https://github.com/pgandhi999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":97985305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Nzk4NTMwNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"pgandhi999/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pgandhi999","id":22228190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjI4MTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22228190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999","html_url":"https://github.com/pgandhi999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pgandhi999/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we are in a strange status that, some data source v2 interfaces(catalog related) are in sql/catalyst, some data source v2 interfaces(Table, ScanBuilder, DataReader, etc.) are in sql/core.\r\n\r\nI don't see a reason to keep data source v2 API in 2 modules. If we should pick one module, I think sql/catalyst is the one to go.\r\n\r\nCatalyst module already has some user-facing stuff like DataType, Row, etc. And we have to update `Analyzer` and `SessionCatalog` to support the new catalog plugin, which needs to be in the catalyst module.\r\n\r\nThis PR can solve the problem we have in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24246\r\n\r\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBecause a review is resolved during analysis when we create a dataset, the content of the view is determined when the dataset is created, not when it is evaluated. Now the explain result of a dataset is not correctly consistent with the collected result of it, because we use pre-analyzed logical plan of the dataset in explain command. The explain command will analyzed the logical plan passed in. So if a view is changed after the dataset was created, the plans shown by explain command aren't the same with the plan of the dataset.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SQL it's easy to see the inferred statistics (`EXPLAIN COST`) and\r\nthe generated code (`EXPLAIN CODEGEN`), but it was much more annoying\r\nto do so via the Dataset/DataFrame APIs. It was more annoying to \r\naccess this information from PySpark, and yet even more annoying from\r\nSparkR, as the work-around for each required dropping down to call JVM\r\nfunctions directly.\r\n\r\nThis patch exposes this via an overload of `explain` that takes 3\r\nboolean arguments (extended, cost and codegen). This doesn't replace\r\nthe old `explain` overloads (to keep backwards compatibility), and\r\nuses booleans to be easily compatible with PySpark and SparkR\r\ncallers.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStatistics snapshot info with current query is really helpful to find out why the query runs slowly, especially caused by bad rejoin order when CBO is enabled. This PR is to show statistics in Optimized Logical Plan in the \"Details\" On SparkSQL ui page when CBO is enabled.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n1. Refactoring `QueryExecution` String method to avoid duplicate code\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen submit  a spark yarn application,  we first create a container launch context and store the relative tokens.\r\nAnd for each attempt of applicationMaster, it would transfer origin tokens  for connecting to yarn.\r\nHowever, it also transfers origin hdfs delegation tokens.\r\nFor a spark streaming application, if its applicationMaster failed when it has run for a long duration.\r\nThe hdfs token stored in container launch context may be expired.\r\nWhen the new attempt applicationMaster `prepareLocalResources`, it would access the hdfs and failed  for token expired.\r\nThis error occured when we rolling upgrading our yarn cluster.\r\n We rolling restart the nodemanagers, the application master failed therefor, then this error occured when application master retry. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, I renew hadoop delegation credentials and  transfer them to the new ugi.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI don't know how to add unit test, i will test it manually.\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-19T02:28:57Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T15:58:40Z","closed_at":"2019-04-22T05:38:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"843df97d651e7b4d3f7a7bafe346cde1cecb4591","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c67405c0d95d66c42314150e8a68c935349545bb","head":{"label":"turboFei:SPARK-27515","ref":"SPARK-27515","sha":"c67405c0d95d66c42314150e8a68c935349545bb","user":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77131854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzEzMTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"turboFei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA previous change moved the removal of empty window expressions to the RemoveNoopOperations rule, which comes after the CollapseWindow rule. Therefore, by the time we get to CollapseWindow, we aren't guaranteed that empty windows have been removed. This change checks that the window expressions are not empty, and only collapses the windows if both windows are non-empty.\r\n\r\nA lengthier description and repro steps here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27514\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA unit test, plus I reran the breaking case mentioned in the Jira ticket.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a long standing issue which I met before and I've seen other people got trouble with it:\r\n[test cases stuck on \"local-cluster mode\" of ReplSuite?](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/test-cases-stuck-on-quot-local-cluster-mode-quot-of-ReplSuite-td3086.html)\r\n[Spark tests hang on local machine due to \"testGuavaOptional\" in JavaAPISuite](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Spark-tests-hang-on-local-machine-due-to-quot-testGuavaOptional-quot-in-JavaAPISuite-tc10999.html)\r\n\r\nWhen running test under local-cluster mode with wrong SPARK_HOME(spark.test.home), test just get stuck and no response forever. After looking into SPARK_WORKER_DIR, I found there's endless executor directories under it. So, this explains what happens during test getting stuck.\r\n\r\nThe whole process looks like:\r\n\r\n1. Driver submits an app to Master and asks for N executors\r\n2. Master inits executor state with LAUNCHING and sends `LaunchExecutor` to Worker\r\n3. Worker receives `LaunchExecutor`, launches ExecutorRunner asynchronously and sends `ExecutorStateChanged(state=RUNNING)` to Mater immediately\r\n4. Master receives `ExecutorStateChanged(state=RUNNING)` and reset `_retyCount` to 0.\r\n5. ExecutorRunner throws exception during executor launching, sends `ExecutorStateChanged(state=FAILED)` to Worker, Worker forwards the msg to Master\r\n6. Master receives `ExecutorStateChanged(state=FAILED)`. Since Master always reset `_retyCount` when it receives RUNNING msg, so, event if a Worker fails to launch executor for continuous many times, ` _retryCount` would never exceed `maxExecutorRetries`. So, Master continue to launch executor and fall into the dead loop.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists in step 3. Worker sends `ExecutorStateChanged(state=RUNNING)` to Master immediately while executor is still launching. And, when Master receive that msg, it believes the executor has launched successfully, and reset `_retryCount` subsequently.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd in GPU and generic resource type allocation to the executors.\r\n\r\nNote this is part of a bigger feature for gpu-aware scheduling and is just how the executor find the resources. The general flow :\r\n\r\n   - users ask for a certain set of resources, for instance number of gpus - each cluster manager has a specific way to do this.\r\n  -  cluster manager allocates a container or set of resources (standalone mode)\r\n-    When spark launches the executor in that container, the executor either has to be told what resources it has or it has to auto discover them.\r\n  -  Executor has to register with Driver and tell the driver the set of resources it has so the scheduler can use that to schedule tasks that requires a certain amount of each of those resources\r\n\r\nIn this pr I added configs and arguments to the executor to be able discover resources. The argument to the executor is intended to be used by standalone mode or other cluster managers that don't have isolation so that it can assign specific resources to specific executors in case there are multiple executors on a node. The argument is a file contains JSON Array of ResourceInformation objects.\r\n\r\nThe discovery script is meant to be used in an isolated environment where the executor only sees the resources it should use.\r\n\r\nNote that there will be follow on PRs to add other parts like the scheduler part. See the epic high level jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24615\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests and manually tested.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of _from_avro_ and _AvroDataToCatalyst_ doesn't allow doing schema evolution since it requires the deserialization of an Avro record with the exact same schema with which it was serialized.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is to add a new option to allow passing the schema used to serialize the records. This allows using a different compatible schema for reading by passing both schemas to _GenericDatumReader_. If no writer's schema is provided, nothing changes from before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nConsider the following example.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// schema ID: 1\r\nval schema1 = \"\"\"\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"record\",\r\n    \"name\": \"MySchema\",\r\n    \"fields\": [\r\n        {\"name\": \"col1\", \"type\": \"int\"},\r\n        {\"name\": \"col2\", \"type\": \"string\"}\r\n     ]\r\n}\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\n// schema ID: 2\r\nval schema2 = \"\"\"\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"record\",\r\n    \"name\": \"MySchema\",\r\n    \"fields\": [\r\n        {\"name\": \"col1\", \"type\": \"int\"},\r\n        {\"name\": \"col2\", \"type\": \"string\"},\r\n        {\"name\": \"col3\", \"type\": \"string\", \"default\": \"\"}\r\n     ]\r\n}\r\n\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe two schemas are compatible - i.e. you can use `schema2` to deserialize events serialized with `schema1`, in which case there will be the field `col3` with the default value.\r\n\r\nNow imagine that you have two dataframes (read from batch or streaming), one with Avro events from schema1 and the other with events from schema2. **We want to combine them into one dataframe** for storing or further processing.\r\n\r\nWith the current `from_avro` function we can only decode each of them with the corresponding schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> val df1 = ... // Avro events created with schema1\r\ndf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [eventBytes: binary]\r\nscala> val decodedDf1 = df1.select(from_avro('eventBytes, schema1) as \"decoded\")\r\ndecodedDf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [decoded: struct<col1: int, col2: string>]\r\n\r\nscala> val df2= ... // Avro events created with schema2\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [eventBytes: binary]\r\nscala> val decodedDf2 = df2.select(from_avro('eventBytes, schema2) as \"decoded\")\r\ndecodedDf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [decoded: struct<col1: int, col2: string, col3: string>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut then `decodedDf1` and `decodedDf2` have different Spark schemas and we can't union them. Instead, with the proposed change we can decode `df1` in the following way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> import scala.collection.JavaConverters._\r\nscala> val decodedDf1 = df1.select(from_avro(data = 'eventBytes, jsonFormatSchema = schema2, options = Map(\"writerSchema\" -> schema1).asJava) as \"decoded\")\r\ndecodedDf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [decoded: struct<col1: int, col2: string, col3: string>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nso that both dataframes have the same schemas and can be merged.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThis PR allows users to pass a new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTest steps to reproduce this:\r\n\r\n1) bin/spark-shell local-cluster[2,1,1024]\r\n```\r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.storage.StorageLevel\r\nscala> val rdd = sc.parallelize(1 to 10, 1).persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY_2)\r\nscala> rdd.count\r\n```\r\nEvents generated are shown like below\r\n```\r\nevent: SparkListenerBlockUpdated(BlockUpdatedInfo(BlockManagerId(1, 10.8.132.160, 65473, None),rdd_0_0,StorageLevel(memory, deserialized, 2 replicas),56,0))\r\nevent: SparkListenerBlockUpdated(BlockUpdatedInfo(BlockManagerId(0, 10.8.132.160, 65474, None),rdd_0_0,StorageLevel(memory, deserialized, 1 replicas),56,0))\r\n```\r\nBut in the UI, in the storage tab it displays in the description like,\r\n  \"Memory Deserialized 1x Replicated\", even though we have given replication as 2.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that, the replication block update events will have replication factor 1. Hence in the AppStatusListener class, we overwrite whatever event comes later. If the replication event comes later, then we update replication factor as 1. \r\n\r\nIn the PR, I am fixing from the AppStatusListener class side, as we need to detect if the event is replication or not. Else we need to update the rdd store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT and Manually tested.\r\n\r\nBefore patch:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-04-18

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd in GPU and generic resource type allocation to the executors.\r\n\r\nNote this is part of a bigger feature for gpu-aware scheduling and is just how the executor find the resources. The general flow :\r\n\r\n  -  users ask for a certain set of resources, for instance number of gpus - each cluster manager has a specific way to do this.\r\n  -  cluster manager allocates a container or set of resources (standalone mode)\r\n  -  When spark launches the executor in that container, the executor either has to be told what resources it has or it has to auto discover them.\r\n  -  Executor has to register with Driver and tell the driver the set of resources it has so the scheduler can use that to schedule tasks that requires a certain amount of each of those resources\r\n\r\nIn this pr I added configs and arguments to the executor to be able discover resources.  The argument to the executor is intended to be used by standalone mode or other cluster managers that don't have isolation so that it can assign specific resources to specific executors in case there are multiple executors on a node.\r\n\r\nThe discovery script is meant to be used in an isolated environment where the executor only sees the resources it should use. \r\n\r\nNote that there will be follow on PRs to add other parts like the scheduler part. See the epic high level jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24615 \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests and manually tested.","created_at":"2019-04-17T16:40:07Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T19:07:15Z","closed_at":"2019-04-17T19:06:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68199041b0e97f5706748072940191fb564f9933","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bee34a060cb824f96fa9fffbcb120dca0db6a7a9","head":{"label":"tgravescs:gpu-sched-executor-clean","ref":"gpu-sched-executor-clean","sha":"bee34a060cb824f96fa9fffbcb120dca0db6a7a9","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24332 introduced an unnecessary `import` statement and two slight issues in the codegen templates in `Cast` for `Date` <-> `Timestamp`.\r\nThis PR removes the unused import statement and fixes the slight codegen issue.\r\n\r\nThe issue in those two codegen templates is this pattern:\r\n```scala\r\nval zid = JavaCode.global(\r\n  ctx.addReferenceObj(\"zoneId\", zoneId, \"java.time.ZoneId\"),\r\n  zoneId.getClass)\r\n```\r\n`zoneId` can refer to an instance of a non-public class, e.g. `java.time.ZoneRegion`, and while this code correctly puts in the 3rd argument to `ctx.addReferenceObj()`, it's still passing `zoneId.getClass` to `JavaCode.global()` which is not desirable, but doesn't cause any immediate bugs in this particular case, because `zid` is used in an expression immediately afterwards.\r\nIf this `zid` ever needs to spill to any explicitly typed variables, e.g. a local variable, and if the spill handling uses the `javaType` on this `GlobalVariable`, it'd generate code that looks like:\r\n```java\r\njava.time.ZoneRegion value1 = ((java.time.ZoneId) references[2] /* literal */);\r\n```\r\nwhich would then be a real bug:\r\n- a non-accessible type `java.time.ZoneRegion` is referenced in the generated code, and\r\n- `ZoneId` -> `ZoneRegion` requires an explicit downcast.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. This PR does not change behavior, and the original PR won't cause any real behavior bug to begin

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr fix hadoop-3.2 test issues(except the `hive-thriftserver` module):\r\n1. Add `hive.metastore.schema.verification` and `datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll` to HiveConf.\r\n2. hadoop-3.2 support access the Hive metastore from 0.12 to 2.2\r\n\r\nAfter [SPARK-27176](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27176) and this PR, we upgraded the built-in Hive to 2.3 when enabling the Hadoop 3.2+ profile. This upgrade fixes the following issues:\r\n- [HIVE-6727](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6727): Table level stats for external tables are set incorrectly.\r\n- [HIVE-15653](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15653): Some ALTER TABLE commands drop table stats.\r\n- [SPARK-12014](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12014): Spark SQL query containing semicolon is broken in Beeline.\r\n- [SPARK-25193](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25193): insert overwrite doesn't throw exception when drop old data fails.\r\n- [SPARK-25919](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25919): Date value corrupts when tables are \"ParquetHiveSerDe\" formatted and target table is Partitioned.\r\n- [SPARK-26332](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26332): Spark sql write orc table on viewFS throws exception.\r\n- [SPARK-26437](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26437): Decimal data becomes bigint to query, unable to query.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis pr test Spark’s Hadoop 3.2 profile on jenkins and #24591 test Spark’s Hadoop 2.7 profile on jenkins\r\n\r\nThis PR close

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have disabled a test related to storage in the History server suite after SPARK-13845. But, after SPARK-22050, we can store the information about block updated events to eventLog, if we enable \"spark.eventLog.logBlockUpdates.enabled=true\". \r\n\r\n   So, we can enable the test, by adding an eventlog corresponding to the application, which has enabled the configuration, \"spark.eventLog.logBlockUpdates.enabled=true\"\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the SparkSQL UI page shows only actual metric info in each SparkPlan node. However with `statistics` info may help us understand how the plan is designed and the reason it runs slowly. This PR is to show `BroadcastHashJoinExec` `numOutputRows` `statistic` info on SparkSQL UI page first when it's available. \r\n\r\nThe main changes:\r\n1. Add `stats` field in `SparkPlan`\r\n2. Initialize `BroadcastHashJoinExec` with the `stats` in `Join` `LogicalPlan`\r\n3. Add `stats` field in `SQLMetric` and show it on UI page when it's available\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRegarding unit test has been added, manual UI test has been tested\r\n\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25250 reports a bug that, a task which is failed with `CommitDeniedException` gets retried many times.\r\n\r\nThis can happen when a stage has 2 task set managers, one is zombie, one is active. A task from the zombie TSM completes, and commits to a central coordinator(assuming it's a file writing task). Then the corresponding task from the active TSM will fail with `CommitDeniedException`. `CommitDeniedException.countTowardsTaskFailures` is false, so the active TSM will keep retrying this task, until the job finishes. This wastes resource a lot.\r\n\r\n#21131 firstly implements that a previous successful completed task from zombie `TaskSetManager` could mark the task of the same partition completed in the active `TaskSetManager`. Later #23871 improves the implementation to cover a corner case that, an active `TaskSetManager` hasn't been created when a previous task succeed.\r\n\r\nHowever, #23871 has a bug and was reverted in #24359. With hindsight, #23781 is fragile because we need to sync the states between `DAGScheduler` and `TaskScheduler`, about which partitions are completed.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new fix:\r\n1. When `DAGScheduler` gets a task success event from an earlier attempt, notify the `TaskSchedulerImpl` about it\r\n2. When `TaskSchedulerImpl` knows a partition is already completed, ask the active `TaskSetManager` to mark the corresponding task as finished, if the task is not finished yet.\r\n\r\nThis fix covers the corner case, because:\r\n1. If `DAGScheduler` gets the task completion event from zombie TSM before submitting the new stage attempt, then `DAGScheduler` knows that this partition is completed, and it will exclude this partition when creating task set for the new stage attempt. See `DAGScheduler.submitMissingTasks`\r\n2. If `DAGScheduler` gets the task completion event from zombie TSM after submitting the new stage attempt, then the active TSM is already created.\r\n\r\nCompared to the previous fix, the message loop becomes longer, so it's likely that, the active task set manager has already retried the task multiple times. But this failure window won't be too big, and we want to avoid the worse case that retries the task many times until the job finishes. So this solution is acceptable.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new test case.","created_at":"2019-04-15T13:09:21Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T06:23:32Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T06:23:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"179ad07a5904683a15400059d514ec766b80ebca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24375/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24375/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24375/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b148c6f119be4b0a5da0c2600add506cd930a647","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:fix2","ref":"fix2","sha":"b148c6f119be4b0a5da0c2600add506cd930a647","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies SparkBuild so that the largest / slowest test suites (or collections of suites) can run in their own forked JVMs, allowing them to be run in parallel with each other. This opt-in / whitelisting approach allows us to increase parallelism without having to fix a long-tail of flakiness / brittleness issues in tests which aren't performance bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nSee comments in SparkBuild.scala for information on the details, including a summary of why we sometimes opt to run entire groups of tests in a single forked JVM .\r\n\r\nThe time of full new pull request test in Jenkins is reduced by around 53%:\r\nbefore changes: 4hr 40min\r\nafter changes: 2hr 13min\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nANSI 2003 standard contains syntax about `insert into` as follows:\r\n```\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark select * from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark select key, value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(key, value, other) select key, value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(key, value, other) select * from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(key, value) select value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(key, other) select value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(value, other) select value, other from gja_test;\r\n```\r\nHive 1.2.0+ support the syntax about `insert into` as follows:\r\n```\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark select * from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark select key, value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(key, value, other) select key, value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(key, value, other) select * from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(key, value) select value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(key, other) select value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark(value, other) select value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into table gja_test_partition partition (col2 = 1) select * from gja_test;\r\ninsert into table gja_test_partition(key, value, other) partition (col2 = 1) select key, value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into table gja_test_partition(key, other) partition (col2 = 1) select key, other from gja_test;\r\n```\r\nThis means that Hive can support flexible selection of some columns in the target table as the target columns for data insertion. See Description of [HIVE-9481](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9481) .\r\nBut Spark SQL only support \r\n```\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark select * from gja_test;\r\ninsert into gja_test_spark select key, value, other from gja_test;\r\ninsert into table gja_test_partition partition (col2 = 1) select * from gja_test;\r\ninsert into table gja_test_partition partition (col2 = 1) select key, value, other from gja_test;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR will enhance the feature. Implemented steps as follows:\r\n\r\n**First**\r\nI checked the implement of `HiveOutputWriter`, it writes data according to the index(position) of columns which belongs target table. So I think should use this feature.\r\n\r\n**Second**\r\nI add the new syntax and pass `insertedCols` as target columns for data insertion.\r\n\r\n**Thrid**\r\nIn order to fill in the columns that are not selected, construct empty expressions and fill them in empty index(position) in `Project.projectList`.\r\n\r\n**Notice**\r\nThis PR only enhance `insert into` for Hive.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExists UT and new added UT.","created_at":"2019-04-15T09:58:05Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T03:36:28Z","closed_at":"2020-01-04T00:06:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e192b35b8767794f2d4d782c0a8caa181d44018","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/146d1ad1956ebebecad3d838f45172079a84cf1c","head":{"label":"beliefer:enhance-insert-into-could-select-columns","ref":"enhance-insert-into-could-select-columns","sha":"146d1ad1956ebebecad3d838f45172079a84cf1c","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"abe370f97132a835e8a7cf15d4ecbffb0d49eafd","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we compile and test Hadoop 3.2, we will hint the following two issues:\r\n1. JobSummaryLevel is not a member of object org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetOutputFormat. Fixed by [PARQUET-381](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-381)(Parquet 1.9.0)\r\n2. java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: BROTLI\r\n    at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.metadata.CompressionCodecName.<clinit>(CompressionCodecName.java:31). Fixed by [PARQUET-1143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1143)(Parquet 1.10.0)\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the `parquet-hadoop-bundle-1.8.1.jar` conflicts with Parquet 1.10.1. This PR shades Parquet 1.10.1 to `sql/core` to workaround this issue. After this PR, the parquet version should be:\r\n\r\n  | sql/core | sql/hive\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nhadoop-2.7 | 1.10.1 | 1.6.0\r\nhadoop-3.2 | 1.10.1 | 1.8.1\r\n\r\nTo make it simple, this PR also removes `parquet-provided` support.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23383/files#diff-db4a140579c1ac4b1dbec7fe5057eecaR36, the exception message of schema inference failure in file source V2 is `tableName`, which is equivalent to `shortName + path`.\r\n\r\nWhile in file source V1, the message is `Unable to infer schema from ORC/CSV/JSON...`. \r\nWe should make the message in V2 consistent with V1, so that in the future migration the related test cases don't need to be modified. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24058#pullrequestreview-226364350\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRevert the modified unit test cases in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24005/files#diff-b9ddfbc9be8d83ecf100b3b8ff9610b9R431 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23383/files#diff-9ab56940ee5a53f2bb81e3c008653362R577, and test with

Sometimes it successes and sometimes it fails with\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: ShuffleMapStage 4  has failed the maximum allowable number of times: 4.\r\nMost recent failure reason: org.apache.spark.shuffle.FetchFailedException\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, with the patch https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23871 , the job hangs forever.\r\n\r\nWhen I investigated it, I found that `DAGScheduler` and `TaskSchedulerImpl` define stage completion differently. `DAGScheduler` thinks a stage is completed if all its partitions are marked as completed ([result stage](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.4.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L1362-L1368) and [shuffle stage](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.4.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L1400)). `TaskSchedulerImpl` thinks a stage's task set is completed when all tasks finish (see the [code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.4.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L779-L784)).\r\n\r\nIdeally this two definition should be consistent, but #23871 breaks it. In our customer's Spark log, I found that, a stage's task set completes, but the stage never completes. More specifically, `DAGScheduler` submits a task set for stage 4.1 with 1000 tasks, but the `TaskSetManager` skips to run the first 100 tasks. Later on, `TaskSetManager` finishes 900 tasks and marks the task set as completed. However, `DAGScheduler` doesn't agree with it and hangs forever, waiting for more task completion events of stage 4.1.\r\n\r\nWith hindsight, I think `TaskSchedulerIImpl.stageIdToFinishedPartitions` is fragile. We need to pay more effort to make sure this is consistent with `DAGScheduler`'s knowledge. When `DAGScheduler` marks some partitions from finished to unfinished, `TaskSchedulerIImpl.stageIdToFinishedPartitions` should be updated as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts #23871, let's think of a more robust idea later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-12T15:36:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-15T12:35:15Z","closed_at":"2019-04-14T09:00:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f96ab527a00a774bb0086acbb22194411ba3c655","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24359/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24359/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24359/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/348307504ed23b9c1dd94fbe8a799a22aeea86c4","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:revert","ref":"revert","sha":"348307504ed23b9c1dd94fbe8a799a22aeea86c4","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the rule `PreprocessTableCreation`, if an existing table is appended with a different provider, the action will fail.\r\nCurrently, there are two implementations for file sources and creating a table with file source V2 will always fall back to V1 FileFormat. We should consider the following cases as valid:\r\n1. Appending a table with file source V2 provider using the v1 file format\r\n2. Appending a table with v1 file format provider using file source V2 format\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-27199 introduced the use of `ZoneId` instead of `TimeZone` in a few date/time expressions.\r\nThere were 3 occurrences of `ctx.addReferenceObj(\"zoneId\", zoneId)` in that PR, which had a bug because while the `java.time.ZoneId` base type is public, the actual concrete implementation classes are not public, so using the 2-arg version of `CodegenContext.addReferenceObj` would incorrectly generate code that reference non-public types (`java.time.ZoneRegion`, to be specific). The 3-arg version should be used, with the class name of the referenced object explicitly specified to the public base type.\r\n\r\nOne of such occurrences was caught in testing in the main PR of SPARK-27199 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24141), for `DateFormatClass`. But the other 2 occurrences slipped through because there were no test cases that covered them.\r\n\r\nExample of this bug in the current Apache Spark master, in a Spark Shell:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq((\"2016-04-08\", \"yyyy-MM-dd\")).toDF(\"s\", \"f\").repartition(1).selectExpr(\"to_unix_timestamp(s, f)\").show\r\n...\r\njava.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class java.time.ZoneRegion from class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the codegen issues and adds the corresponding unit tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nEnhanced tests in `DateExpressionsSuite` for `to_unix_timestamp` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a heartbeat timeout happens in HeartbeatReceiver, it doesn't remove lost executors from CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend. When a connection of an executor is not gracefully shut down, CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend may not receive a disconnect event. In this case, CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend still thinks a lost executor is still alive. CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend may ask TaskScheduler to run tasks on this lost executor. This task will never finish and the job will hang forever.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd UT in HeartbeatReceiverSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-11T16:21:59Z","updated_at":"2019-12-27T03:53:13Z","closed_at":"2019-12-27T03:52:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e125048f0c9cadfec00e056c50689ac9845896b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we compile and test Hadoop 3.2, we will hint the following two issues:\r\n1. JobSummaryLevel is not a member of object org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetOutputFormat. Fixed by [PARQUET-381](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-381)(Parquet 1.9.0)\r\n2. java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: BROTLI\r\n    at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.metadata.CompressionCodecName.<clinit>(CompressionCodecName.java:31). Fixed by [PARQUET-1143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1143)(Parquet 1.10.0)\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the `parquet-hadoop-bundle-1.8.1.jar` conflicts with Parquet 1.10.1.\r\nI think it would be safe to upgrade Hive's parquet to 1.10.1 to workaround this issue.\r\n\r\nThis is what Hive did when upgrading Parquet 1.8.1 to 1.10.0: [HIVE-17000](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-17000) and [HIVE-19464](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-19464). We can see that all changes are related to vectors, and vectors are disabled by default: see [HIVE-14826](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14826) and [HiveConf.java#L2723](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/rel/release-2.3.4/common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/conf/HiveConf.java#L2723).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pr removes [parquet-hadoop-bundle-1.8.1.jar](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/tree/master/parquet-hadoop-bundle) , so Hive serde will use [parquet-common-1.10.1.jar, parquet-column-1.10.1.jar and parquet-hadoop-1.10.1.jar](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/dev/deps/spark-deps-hadoop-3.2#L185-L189).\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. manual tests\r\n2.

jenkins](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24044#commits-pushed-0c3f962)\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-11T11:45:10Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T01:42:01Z","closed_at":"2019-04-19T16:01:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43ddaf9cb9258c1ba42b77fa9dcd0f9c108eab21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5600c79b7409035e15f2077b655feccec6e57dc3","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-27176","ref":"SPARK-27176","sha":"5600c79b7409035e15f2077b655feccec6e57dc3","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"074533334d01afdd7862a1ac6c5a7a672bcce3f8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is trying to optimize uncorrelated predicate subqueries(InSubquery, Exists).\r\nCurrently, we rewrite all the predicate subqueries(`InSubquery`, `Exists`) as semi-join/anti-join. But uncorrelated predicate subquery can be evaluated using a subplan instead of a join. We can firstly  optimize the subquery and then compute it using a subquery physical plan.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new Optimize rule: RewriteUncorrelatedSubquery.\r\nThis rule rewrites uncorrelated PredicateSubquery expressions such as Exists(it can also be used for ANY/SOME/ALL). We can use `limit 1` and `select 1` after the Exists subquery to reduce the result set. \r\n\r\nAlso, this PR adds physical plans of 'InSubquery' and 'Exists'.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nut\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-11T10:22:22Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T02:41:02Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T02:41:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"084564041c67fbad7def0938079b1ca61aa38e33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24344/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24344/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24344/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/86f6c9deb99fcf4eb28b29a1dfe6beea68bedb38","head":{"label":"francis0407:SPARK-27440","ref":"SPARK-27440","sha":"86f6c9deb99fcf4eb28b29a1dfe6beea68bedb38","user":{"login":"francis0407","id":25431723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDMxNzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25431723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407","html_url":"https://github.com/francis0407","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169244879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjkyNDQ4Nzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"francis0407/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"francis0407","id":25431723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDMxNzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25431723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407","html_url":"https://github.com/francis0407","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis0407/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/francis0407/spark","description":"Apache
