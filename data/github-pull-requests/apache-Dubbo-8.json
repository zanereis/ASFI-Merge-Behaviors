quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-19T14:22:34Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T03:59:29Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f67753df780824ef2387d3cb757e94044deb063f","head":{"label":"xieshouyu:bugfix/comsuerInstanceRegistryPlan3","ref":"bugfix/comsuerInstanceRegistryPlan3","sha":"f67753df780824ef2387d3cb757e94044deb063f","user":{"login":"xieshouyu","id":29672850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjcyODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29672850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu","html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":580273067,"node_id":"R_kgDOIpZDqw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xieshouyu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xieshouyu","id":29672850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjcyODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29672850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu","html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-19T10:58:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T23:46:35Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc8cf32db149263f64a8360bf7297bd2752c5ad6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13949/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13949/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13949/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/44d76272ba4c608cad38c7a86d48a2478a6c0c11","head":{"label":"mengle-yang:master","ref":"master","sha":"44d76272ba4c608cad38c7a86d48a2478a6c0c11","user":{"login":"mengle-yang","id":31506634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTA2NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31506634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang","html_url":"https://github.com/mengle-yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":280063887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODAwNjM4ODc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mengle-yang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mengle-yang","id":31506634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTA2NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31506634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang","html_url":"https://github.com/mengle-yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mengle-yang/dubbo","description":"Apache

is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-18T09:33:37Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T03:04:13Z","closed_at":"2024-05-08T03:04:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0232547fb89258fd09ab399dcc2e137b83bf319","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13942/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13942/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13942/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6817d040804102c14a835699c9bd1b3c582d6c2d","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-adjust-subscribe-order","ref":"3.2-adjust-subscribe-order","sha":"6817d040804102c14a835699c9bd1b3c582d6c2d","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

This allows you to do e.g.:</p>\n<p>await.forever until { .. }</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added shortcut for enabling logging.

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the newer versions of Hibernate-validator, the package names of the relevant validation implementation classes have been migrated from `javax` to `jakarta`.\r\n\r\nDubbo has been support new validator with `jakarta` in #9552 , but the setting of default validator is implement with `javax`, if the user is not configured to use a new validator under the SpringBoot3, an `NoClassDefFoundError` will be throw.\r\n\r\nIf the validator supports automatic switch, this will reduce a lot of configuration processes for users.\r\n\r\nrelated with #12401 #12465\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfix issue #13812.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen user type 'Ctrl + C' in telnet client,  telnet client will send the following sequence: `FF F4 FF FD 06` to server, it can be divided into two parts:\r\n1. 'FF F4' is telnet interrupt process command.\r\n2. 'FF FD 06' is  to suppress the output of the process that is to be interrupted by the  interrupt process command.\r\n\r\nWe need to response with 'FF FC 06' to ignore it and tell the client continue display output.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. add a `CtrlCHandler` to handle 'Ctrl + C'  request\r\n2. add CtrlCHandler to Netty pipeline , place it  previous to `LineBasedFrameDecoder`\r\n3. add a `CtrlCHandlerTest` to test it.\r\n\r\nfinally look like this: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/32724602/075d5f92-c6b9-4614-a87b-db9e40a787c8)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-13T11:31:26Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T06:36:34Z","closed_at":"2024-03-14T06:36:34Z","merged_at":"2024-03-14T06:36:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"1145b4015b0f6ead51c3bd192638492bb8ee1a9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13916/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13916/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13916/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c412fd8258923a3320031f7edbb290e2e6413f4c","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.3-remove-bytebuddy","ref":"3.3-remove-bytebuddy","sha":"c412fd8258923a3320031f7edbb290e2e6413f4c","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/13722\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. remove root application context judgment condition, the AwaitingNonWebApplicationListener can only be invoked in the application context which it registered.\r\n\r\n2. add shutdownHookCallback member variable to ensure there is only one shutdownHookCallback instance to register\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-12T10:42:43Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T14:25:09Z","closed_at":"2024-11-07T14:25:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc5ec536af63fc5e336f6f03d8db15f3ee680a3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7e4f8cf08067ca09d6e804e58287b71d4a8100e7","head":{"label":"laywin:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"7e4f8cf08067ca09d6e804e58287b71d4a8100e7","user":{"login":"laywin","id":22276474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjc2NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22276474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin","html_url":"https://github.com/laywin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":743614834,"node_id":"R_kgDOLFKpcg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"laywin/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"laywin","id":22276474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjc2NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22276474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin","html_url":"https://github.com/laywin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laywin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/laywin/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change addresses the issue of the event loop being blocked for an extended period, improving overall performance and responsiveness.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis PR addresses the issue #13853 where `connectionClient.doConnect()` was blocking the event loop for up to 3 seconds. \r\nTo resolve this, the connection process has been moved to a separate thread using an `ExecutorService`.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nChanges:\r\n- Removed the scheduling of `connectionClient.doConnect()` on the event loop.\r\n- Added submission of `connectionClient.doConnect()` to an `ExecutorService` to execute in a separate thread.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-08T03:59:40Z","updated_at":"2024-03-10T03:22:59Z","closed_at":"2024-03-10T03:22:59Z","merged_at":"2024-03-10T03:22:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"d50adb7c837448358ae980c7f90cd43daf6eab8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13858/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13858/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13858/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e98a335328b55b76639850558a062da940224435","head":{"label":"hyhnet:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"e98a335328b55b76639850558a062da940224435","user":{"login":"hyhnet","id":24771910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzcxOTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24771910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet","html_url":"https://github.com/hyhnet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768958884,"node_id":"R_kgDOLdVhpA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"hyhnet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hyhnet","id":24771910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzcxOTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24771910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet","html_url":"https://github.com/hyhnet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhnet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hyhnet/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-07T03:52:33Z","updated_at":"2024-03-07T04:35:30Z","closed_at":"2024-03-07T03:56:20Z","merged_at":"2024-03-07T03:56:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4a1e0d9bbd3ba65a1e3a3eaf6f68b9037c33030","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13851/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13851/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13851/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f5a65f1d628a3ca84b3aaff8fa385a14073924ef","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0307-readme","ref":"0307-readme","sha":"f5a65f1d628a3ca84b3aaff8fa385a14073924ef","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-04T09:50:02Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T10:33:16Z","closed_at":"2024-03-04T09:50:57Z","merged_at":"2024-03-04T09:50:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"26cc9896f0e88fefbc180004758eb8ed573cb969","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/38a035f601b0f5a22585ed8767e76d8d0c9d69ef","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0304-precheck-style","ref":"0304-precheck-style","sha":"38a035f601b0f5a22585ed8767e76d8d0c9d69ef","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.62.2</h2>\n<h2>gRPC Java 1.62.2 Release Notes</h2>\n<p>Note that this is the initial 1.62.x release</p>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>services: Remove <code>io.grpc.services.BinaryLogs</code>, which was deprecated since 2021. <code>io.grpc.protobuf.services.BinaryLogs</code> should be used instead (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10832\">#10832</a>).</li>\n<li>Allow users outside of io.grpc.xds package to create custom xDS resources (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10834\">#10834</a>) (6d96e6588)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api:Add ClientTransportFilter.  Similarly to ServerTransportFilter, this will provide an observability hook and it allows direct modification of the transport's attributes. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10646\">#10646</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>java_grpc_library.bzl: Add support for Auto Exec Groups (cb03bd234). This is mostly a behind-the-scenes change to adjust to the newer way Bazel operates</li>\n<li>java_grpc_library.bzl: Support runfiles for protoc and the plugin (65a6b3bc2). Neither binary uses runfiles, but the task will be ready if they need to in the future</li>\n<li>xds: Add EC key support for XdsChannelCredentials/XdsServerCredentials (100d5a55f)</li>\n<li>binder:Change log level from WARNING to FINER for expected exception during close with error, to reduce log spamming (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10899\">#10899</a>) (7ba0718bb)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Fix a bug in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer policy that could raise NullPointerException and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-26T08:44:31Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T09:31:39Z","closed_at":"2024-02-26T09:11:10Z","merged_at":"2024-02-26T09:11:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"6dbac54b398252ce0110ddb55150d3f0422c13be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/28cc641ef9acfccaa32da118cd35dfdc5d6d61a8","head":{"label":"xwxtwd:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"28cc641ef9acfccaa32da118cd35dfdc5d6d61a8","user":{"login":"xwxtwd","id":3345621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDU2MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3345621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd","html_url":"https://github.com/xwxtwd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":763409572,"node_id":"R_kgDOLYC0pA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xwxtwd/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xwxtwd","id":3345621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDU2MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3345621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd","html_url":"https://github.com/xwxtwd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwxtwd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xwxtwd/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-25T07:06:58Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T02:44:29Z","closed_at":"2024-02-28T02:44:29Z","merged_at":"2024-02-28T02:44:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"69dd801db2f50e03faf58c60f6eb3f4ea72fee5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/68","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/68","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/68/labels","id":10476983,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4An923","number":68,"title":"3.2.14","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":3,"closed_issues":19,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-01-27T13:38:55Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T01:49:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/61c672900b28ffe8a2868c07b77e5846ad591c3a","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/fix_dubbo_demo_xml_double_path_error","ref":"feature/fix_dubbo_demo_xml_double_path_error","sha":"61c672900b28ffe8a2868c07b77e5846ad591c3a","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"99613a1f566775ca6d442088e7dcc84a3cc112a8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.
