What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13866\n\nThis PR adds the support to infer `DecimalType`. \nHere are the rules between `IntegerType`, `LongType` and `DecimalType`.\n#### Infering Types\n1. `IntegerType` and then `LongType`are tried first. \n   \n   ``` scala\n   Int.MaxValue => IntegerType\n   Long.MaxValue => LongType\n   ```\n2. If it fails, try `DecimalType`.\n   \n   ``` scala\n   (Long.MaxValue + 1) => DecimalType(20, 0)\n   ```\n   \n   This does not try to infer this as `DecimalType` when scale is less than 0.\n3. if it fails, try `DoubleType`\n   \n   ``` scala\n   0.1 => DoubleType // This is failed to be inferred as `DecimalType` because it has the scale, 1.\n   ```\n#### Compatible Types (Merging Types)\n\nFor merging types, this is the same with JSON data source. If `DecimalType` is not capable, then it becomes `DoubleType`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were used and `./dev/run_tests` for code style

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis commit adds support for pluggable cluster manager. And also allows a cluster manager to clean up tasks without taking the parent process down.\n\nTo plug a new external cluster manager, ExternalClusterManager trait should be implemented. It returns task scheduler and backend scheduler that will be used by SparkContext to schedule tasks. An external cluster manager is registered using the java.util.ServiceLoader mechanism (This mechanism is also being used to register data sources like parquet, json, jdbc etc.). This allows auto-loading implementations of ExternalClusterManager interface.\n\nCurrently, when a driver fails, executors exit using system.exit. This does not bode well for cluster managers that would like to reuse the parent process of an executor. Hence,\n1. Moving system.exit to a function that can be overriden in subclasses of CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.\n2. Added functionality of killing all the running tasks in an executor.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExternalClusterManagerSuite.scala was added to test this patch.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13903\n\nWith constraints and optimization, we can make sure some outputs of a Join (or Filter) operator are not nulls. In other words, we actually change output nullability for these operators. But we don't modify their output attribute accordingly. We should modify output nullability to keep correct schema because we will use the output to determine schema . Besides, we can also use this information in later execution to avoid null checking.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nModified `InferFiltersFromConstraintsSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-15T09:26:35Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:20Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T03:18:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb28c3406aaccdfec234203559a4af981e980449","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/da3f35b4d315cc3c2576ac781cd3e8beef5eb774","head":{"label":"viirya:output-nullable-with-constraint","ref":"output-nullable-with-constraint","sha":"da3f35b4d315cc3c2576ac781cd3e8beef5eb774","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis regression is introduced in #9182, previously attempt id is simply as counter \"1\" or \"2\". With the change of #9182, it is changed to full name as \"appattemtp-xxx-00001\", this will affect all the parts which uses this attempt id, like event log file name, history server app url link. So here change it back to the counter to keep consistent with previous code.\n\nAlso revert back this patch #11518, this patch fix the url link of history log according to the new way of attempt id, since here we change back to the previous way, so this patch is not necessary, here to revert it.\n\nAlso clean \"spark.yarn.app.id\" and \"spark.yarn.app.attemptId\", since it is useless now.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTest it with unit test and manually test different scenario:\n1. application running in yarn-client mode.\n2. application running in yarn-cluster mode.\n3. application running in yarn-cluster mode with multiple attempts.\n\nChecked both the event log file name and url link.\n\nCC @vanzin @tgravescs , please help to review, thanks a lot.\n","created_at":"2016-03-15T09:08:43Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T19:41:38Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T19:41:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"93ee9f76b8a879710e54f6496a42b96934075f08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11721/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11721/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11721/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/188c83b3317a5dda5d896a9c1a6da9373aeb2091","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-13885","ref":"SPARK-13885","sha":"188c83b3317a5dda5d896a9c1a6da9373aeb2091","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nOur internal code can go through SessionState.catalog and SessionState.analyzer. This brings two small benefits:\n1. Reduces internal dependency on SQLContext.\n2. Removes 2 public methods in Java (Java does not obey package private visibility).\n\nMore importantly, according to the design in SPARK-13485, we'd need to claim this catalog function for the user-facing public functions, rather than having an internal field.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit/integration test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe max number of executor failure before failing the application is default to twice the maximum number of executors if dynamic allocation is enabled. The default value for \"spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors\" is Int.MaxValue. So this causes an integer overflow and a wrong result. The calculated value of the default max number of executor failure is 3. This PR adds a check to avoid the overflow.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nIt tests if the value is greater that Int.MaxValue / 2 to avoid the overflow when it multiplies 2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn general it is better for internal classes to not depend on the external class (in this case SQLContext) to reduce coupling between user-facing APIs and the internal implementations. This patch removes SQLContext dependency from some internal classes such as SparkPlanner, SparkOptimizer.\n\nAs part of this patch, I also removed the following internal methods from SQLContext:\n\n```\nprotected[sql] def functionRegistry: FunctionRegistry\nprotected[sql] def optimizer: Optimizer\nprotected[sql] def sqlParser: ParserInterface\nprotected[sql] def planner: SparkPlanner\nprotected[sql] def continuousQueryManager\nprotected[sql] def prepareForExecution: RuleExecutor[SparkPlan]\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit/integration tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-15T05:10:34Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T07:00:31Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T07:00:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30b45defa5ba574ab6c148c39f7f71c714bed0a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11712/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11712/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11712/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/31fc6cd1206b5918a3a5fb8b93d9cf27dad28e9b","head":{"label":"rxin:sqlContext-planner","ref":"sqlContext-planner","sha":"31fc6cd1206b5918a3a5fb8b93d9cf27dad28e9b","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix expression generation for optional types. \nStandard Java reflection causes issues when dealing with synthetic Scala objects (things that do not map to Java and thus contain a dollar sign in their name). This patch introduces Scala reflection in such cases.\n\nThis patch also adds a regression test for Dataset's handling of classes defined in package objects (which was the initial purpose of this PR).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA new test in ExpressionEncoderSuite that tests optional inner classes and a regression test for Dataset's handling of package

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe introduced some local operators in org.apache.spark.sql.execution.local package but never fully wired the engine to actually use these. We still plan to implement a full local mode, but it's probably going to be fairly different from what the current iterator-based local mode would look like. Based on what we know right now, we might want a push-based columnar version of these operators.\n\nLet's just remove them for now, and we can always re-introduced them in the future by looking at branch-1.6.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is simply dead code removal.\n","created_at":"2016-03-14T23:45:15Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T02:23:44Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T02:23:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"23f1a45c8628d05e87fdd1b3556311df27bf1862","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50184024c8b9e84d657fd80e0110f4787ea5e7c6","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-13882","ref":"SPARK-13882","sha":"50184024c8b9e84d657fd80e0110f4787ea5e7c6","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen initial creating `CVSSuite.scala` in SPARK-12833, there was a typo on `scalastyle:on`: `scalstyle:on`. So, it turns off ScalaStyle checking for the rest of the file mistakenly. So, it can not find a violation on the code of `SPARK-12668` added recently. This issue fixes the existing escaping correctly and adds a new escaping for `SPARK-12668` code like the following.\n\n``` scala\n   test(\"test aliases sep and encoding for delimiter and charset\") {\n+    // scalastyle:off\n     val cars = sqlContext\n...\n       .load(testFile(carsFile8859))\n+    // scalastyle:on\n```\n\nThis will prevent future potential problems, too.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins test.\n","created_at":"2016-03-14T19:27:41Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T05:27:24Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T06:24:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f9675ffc76afc752c0d678d8607f763a2dac352","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dcb55da8bea74dee78872c611b6aa59d8daa6332","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-13870","ref":"SPARK-13870","sha":"dcb55da8bea74dee78872c611b6aa59d8daa6332","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8301fadd8d269da11e72870b7a889596e3337839","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

a _SUCCESS appears in the inner partitioning dir, partition discovery will treat that _SUCCESS file as a data file. Then, partition discovery will fail because it finds that the dir structure is not valid. We should ignore those `_SUCCESS` files.\n\nIn future, it is better to ignore all files/dirs starting with `_` or `.`. This PR does not make this change. I am thinking about making this change simple, so we can consider of getting it in branch 1.6.\n\nTo ignore all files/dirs starting with `_` or `, the main change is to let ParquetRelation have another way to get metadata files. Right now, it relies on FileStatusCache's cachedLeafStatuses, which returns file statuses of both metadata files (e.g. metadata files used by parquet) and data files, which requires more

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13854\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, for left outer join we only keep left side constraint. For right outer join, we only keep right side constraints. For full outer join, the constraints are empty.\n\nIn fact, the constraints are less than the actual constraints for the join operator.\n\nFor example, for left outer join, besides the constraints from left side, the constraints of right side should be inherited with a bit modification.\n\nConsider a join as following:\n\n```\nval tr1 = LocalRelation('a.int, 'b.int, 'c.int).subquery('tr1)\nval tr2 = LocalRelation('a.int, 'd.int, 'e.int).subquery('tr2)\n\ntr1.where('a.attr > 10)\n  .join(tr2.where('d.attr < 100), LeftOuter, Some(\"tr1.a\".attr === \"tr2.a\".attr))\n```\n\nThe constraints are not only \"a\" > 10, \"a\" is not null. It should also include (\"d\" is null || \"d\" < 100).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThree tests in `ConstraintPropagationSuite` are modified for this PR.\n","created_at":"2016-03-14T08:09:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:16Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T23:29:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eafa4d97453b659e799248ef7be1fa612dba16b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6379d8bf800c3f9af40875a9ac11f34da23860ee","head":{"label":"viirya:join-constraints","ref":"join-constraints","sha":"6379d8bf800c3f9af40875a9ac11f34da23860ee","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch is fixing the race condition in ApplicationMaster when receiving a signal. In the current implementation, if signal is received and with no any exception, this application will be finished with successful state in Yarn, and there's no another attempt. Actually the application is killed by signal in the runtime, so another attempt is expected.\n\nThis patch adds a signal handler to handle the signal things, if signal is received, marking this application finished with failure, rather than success.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch is tested with following situations:\n\nApplication is finished normally.\nApplication is finished by calling System.exit(n).\nApplication is killed by yarn command.\nApplicationMaster is killed by \"SIGTERM\" send by kill pid command.\nApplicationMaster is killed by NM with \"SIGTERM\" in case of NM failure.\n","created_at":"2016-03-14T06:57:09Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T02:23:27Z","closed_at":"2016-03-28T02:23:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87af8fe7530b477bfcb73b47a11a4ec4a7924ca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b75927e0a5a14da091157b746d0244482c0a54e7","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-13642-1.6-backport","ref":"SPARK-13642-1.6-backport","sha":"b75927e0a5a14da091157b746d0244482c0a54e7","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

current implementation of collect_list uses the Hive UDAF, which is ill-performant especially considering the need for ImperativeAggregate to convert between Catalyst types and Scala types.\n\nIn the case of collect_list, we can bypass converting the elements of the groups and just combine the encompassing arrays.\n\nI added a new unit test in DataFrameAggregateSuite to exercise this code path. I don't have a formal comparison between the Hive UDAF and this, unfortunately - I did write an imperative aggregate implementation of collect_list and found the declarative variant to be significantly faster. More specific numbers should be recorded here when we get the chance.\n\nSome things to think about:\n- Code generation for the expressions - I'm not too familiar with writing code generation pieces, so it would be good to fill this in.\n- I wonder if we can do better for the memory allocation in the expressions. Right now every updateList() call calls Array.:+ which isn't the most

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR simplifies generated code with a non-nullable column. This PR addresses three items:\n1. Generate simplified code for and / or\n2. Generate better code for divide and remainder with non-zero dividend\n3. Pass nullable information into BoundReference at WholeStageCodegen\n\nI have attached the generated code with and without this PR\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by existing test suites in sql/core\n\nHere is a motivating example\n\n```\n(0 to 6).map(i => (i.toString, i.toInt)).toDF(\"k\", \"v\")\n  .filter(\"v % 2 == 0\").filter(\"v <= 4\").filter(\"v > 1\").show()\n```\n\nGenerated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore this PR, two Optimizer rules `ColumnPruning` and `PushPredicateThroughProject` reverse each other's effects. Optimizer always reaches the max iteration when optimizing some queries. Extra `Project` are found in the plan. For example, below is the optimized plan after reaching 100 iterations:\n\n```\nJoin Inner, Some((cast(id1#16 as bigint) = id1#18L))\n:- Project [id1#16]\n:  +- Filter isnotnull(cast(id1#16 as bigint))\n:     +- Project [id1#16]\n:        +- Relation[id1#16,newCol#17] JSON part: struct<>, data: struct<id1:int,newCol:int>\n+- Filter isnotnull(id1#18L)\n   +- Relation[id1#18L] JSON part: struct<>, data: struct<id1:bigint>\n```\n\nThis PR splits the optimizer rule `ColumnPruning` to `ColumnPruning` and `EliminateOperators`\n\nThe issue becomes worse when having another rule `NullFiltering`, which could add extra Filters for `IsNotNull`. We have to be careful when introducing extra `Filter` if the benefit is not large enough. Another PR will be submitted by @sameeragarwal to handle this issue.\n\ncc @sameeragarwal @marmbrus \n\nIn addition, `ColumnPruning` should not push `Project` through non-deterministic `Filter`. This could cause wrong results. This will be put in a separate PR.\n\ncc @davies @cloud-fan @yhuai \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nModified the existing test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-03-13T02:06:25Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T06:17:45Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T07:31:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c169de2c8f3808adc825b5002e9573438b4ee6e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11682/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11682/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11682/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc4685aaabeeb4e58eb4aacccc4915d30349481e","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:viewDuplicateNames","ref":"viewDuplicateNames","sha":"bc4685aaabeeb4e58eb4aacccc4915d30349481e","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13839\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR improves Filter codegen by:\n1. After #11585, we filter out the rows early if it have null value. So we can only evaluate the inputs used in these filtering before this plan. The evaluation of other inputs can be deferred after the filtering done.\n2. Currently we check `IsNotNull(a)` to find the attributes needed to filter out null values. However, the expression `IsNotNull(Cast(a, dt))` will not be checked by this. We should add pattern to find this.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-12T09:12:34Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:10Z","closed_at":"2016-03-17T05:10:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c3a936ca5a8c02c42bc8f47a87a32d1c206a052","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e4748b5e38859884f9d1ceebb87d0af0a9c4711","head":{"label":"viirya:improve-filter-codegen","ref":"improve-filter-codegen","sha":"6e4748b5e38859884f9d1ceebb87d0af0a9c4711","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSome operators will produce new attributes as output(e.g. most leaf nodes and Generate), and we should exclude them when calculating missing input. Nowadays subclasses can override `producedAttributes` to fix this issue, which is the recommended way. However, they can also override `reference` or `missingInput`, we should stop doing this and mark these 2 methods as `final` to force subclasses to override `producedAttributes` only.\n\nExcept `producedAttributes`, sub-classes can also produce new attributes by `Alias`. This approach is better but can't fit in all situations, e.g. `Generate`, `Expand`, `ScriptTransform`, etc. These operators have nothing to alias and behave like a leaf node. But `EvaluatePython` operator can produce new attribute by alias, so this PR also changes `EveluatePython` to use the alias approach.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently there are a few sub-projects, each for integrating with different external sources for Streaming.  Now that we have better ability to include external libraries (spark packages) and with Spark 2.0 coming up, we can move the following projects out of Spark to https://github.com/spark-packages\n- streaming-flume\n- streaming-akka\n- streaming-mqtt\n- streaming-zeromq\n- streaming-twitter\n\nThey are just some ancillary packages and considering the overhead of maintenance, running tests and PR failures, it's better to maintain them out of Spark. In addition, these projects can have their different release cycles and we can release them faster.\n\nI have already copied these projects to https://github.com/spark-packages\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests\n","created_at":"2016-03-12T01:19:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T17:01:50Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T02:18:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6986c7bd739ec19e6fbe5b7c124c373363bc433","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/806dba859d03ca0db92991f6e5baf27aa15f7322","head":{"label":"zsxwing:remove-external-pkg","ref":"remove-external-pkg","sha":"806dba859d03ca0db92991f6e5baf27aa15f7322","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e06493cb7b790623a9106241a8d496ecea703328","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n**[I'll link it to the JIRA once ASF JIRA is back online]**\n\nThis PR modifies the existing `CombineFilters` rule to remove redundant conditions while combining individual filter predicates. For instance, queries of the form `table.where('a === 1 && 'b === 1).where('a === 1 && 'c === 1)` will now be optimized to `table.where('a === 1 && 'b === 1 && 'c === 1)` (instead of `table.where('a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor 2.0.0, we had better make **sbt** and **sbt plugins** up-to-date. This PR checks the status of each plugins and bumps the followings.\n- sbt: 0.13.9 --> 0.13.11\n- sbteclipse-plugin: 2.2.0 --> 4.0.0\n- sbt-dependency-graph: 0.7.4 --> 0.8.2\n- sbt-mima-plugin: 0.1.6 --> 0.1.9\n- sbt-revolver: 0.7.2 --> 0.8.0\n\nAll other plugins are up-to-date. (Note that `sbt-avro` seems to be change from 0.3.2 to 1.0.1, but it's not published in the repository.)\n\nDuring upgrade, this PR also updated the following MiMa error. Note that the related excluding filter is already registered correctly. It seems due to the change of MiMa exception result.\n\n```\n // SPARK-12896 Send only accumulator updates to driver, not TaskMetrics\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR generalizes the `NullFiltering` optimizer rule in catalyst to `InferFiltersFromConstraints` that can automatically infer all relevant filters based on an operator's constraints while making sure of 2 things:\n\n(a) no redundant filters are generated, and \n(b) filters that do not contribute to any further optimizations are not generated.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExtended all tests in `InferFiltersFromConstraintsSuite` (that were initially based on `NullFilteringSuite` to test filter inference in `Filter` and `Join` operators.\n\nIn particular the 2 tests ( `single inner join with pre-existing filters: filter out values on either side` and `multiple inner joins: filter out values on all sides on equi-join keys` attempts to highlight/test the real potential of this rule for join optimization.\n","created_at":"2016-03-11T23:40:48Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T23:28:30Z","closed_at":"2016-03-16T23:28:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4e670aaad8986d7e4c5a8cab7b35d03dc409075","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92d935fc8c1204b5d8272655dbe0e606270e5854","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:infer-filters","ref":"infer-filters","sha":"92d935fc8c1204b5d8272655dbe0e606270e5854","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we call DataFrame/Dataset.collect(), Java serializer (or Kryo Serializer) will be used to serialize the UnsafeRows in executor, then deserialize them into UnsafeRows in driver. Java serializer (and Kyro serializer) are slow on millions rows, because they try to find out the same rows, but usually there is no same rows.\n\nThis PR will serialize the UnsafeRows as byte array by packing them together, then Java serializer (or Kyro serializer) serialize the bytes very fast (there are fewer blocks and byte array are not compared by content).\n\nThe UnsafeRow format is highly compressible, the serialized bytes are also compressed (configurable by spark.io.compression.codec).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests.\n\nAdd a benchmark for collect, before this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds type conversion functionality for parameters in Pyspark. A `typeConverter` field is added to the constructor of `Param` class. This argument is a function which converts values passed to this param to the appropriate type if possible. This is beneficial so that the params can fail at set time if they are given inappropriate values, but even more so because coherent error messages are now provided when Py4J cannot cast the python type to the appropriate Java type. \n\nThis patch also adds a `TypeConverters` class with factory methods for common type conversions. Most of the changes involve adding these factory type converters to existing params. The previous solution to this issue, `expectedType`, is deprecated and can be removed in 2.1.0 as discussed on the Jira.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were added in python/pyspark/ml/tests.py to test parameter type conversion. These tests check that values that should be convertible are converted correctly, and that the appropriate errors are thrown when invalid values are provided.\n","created_at":"2016-03-11T23:15:29Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T15:49:50Z","closed_at":"2016-03-23T18:22:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a80b509a70da358c3e507278aaab6df1ab9ac3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e55f8330b0d9c8b6ecd7174b911c69191e4f9bb","head":{"label":"sethah:SPARK-13068-tc","ref":"SPARK-13068-tc","sha":"3e55f8330b0d9c8b6ecd7174b911c69191e4f9bb","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR tries to solve a fundamental issue in the `SQLBuilder`. When we want to turn a logical plan into SQL string and put it after FROM clause, we need to wrap it with a sub-query. However, a logical plan is allowed to have same-name outputs with different qualifiers(e.g. the `Join` operator), and this kind of plan can't be put under a subquery as we will erase and assign a new qualifier to all outputs and make it impossible to distinguish same-name outputs.\n\nTo solve this problem, this PR renames all attributes with globally unique names(using exprId), so that we don't need qualifiers to resolve ambiguity anymore.\n\nFor example, `SELECT x.key, MAX(y.key) OVER () FROM t x JOIN t y`, we will parse this SQL to a Window operator and a Project operator, and add a sub-query between them. The generated SQL looks like:\n\n```\nSELECT sq_1.key, sq_1.max\nFROM (\n    SELECT sq_0.key, sq_0.key, MAX(sq_0.key) OVER () AS max\n    FROM (\n        SELECT x.key, y.key FROM t1 AS x JOIN t2 AS y\n    ) AS sq_0\n) AS sq_1\n```\n\nYou can see, the `key` columns become ambiguous after `sq_0`.\n\nAfter this PR, it will generate something like:\n\n```\nSELECT attr_30 AS key, attr_37 AS max\nFROM (\n    SELECT attr_30, attr_37\n    FROM (\n        SELECT attr_30, attr_35, MAX(attr_35) AS attr_37\n        FROM (\n            SELECT attr_30, attr_35 FROM\n                (SELECT key AS attr_30 FROM t1) AS sq_0\n            INNER JOIN\n                (SELECT key AS attr_35 FROM t1) AS sq_1\n        ) AS sq_2\n    ) AS sq_3\n) AS sq_4\n```\n\nThe outermost SELECT is used to turn the generated named to real names back, and the innermost SELECT is used to alias real columns to our generated names. Between them, there is no name ambiguity anymore.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests and new tests in LogicalPlanToSQLSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-03-11T14:46:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T18:59:12Z","closed_at":"2016-03-16T18:59:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86957d3ae86bc3e9ad26031eaef0405077adfa0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ef9fd4956eb76d7d6988e445fbd6ae61a1d0481","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:gensql","ref":"gensql","sha":"5ef9fd4956eb76d7d6988e445fbd6ae61a1d0481","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- Fixes calls to `new String(byte[])` or `String.getBytes()` that rely on platform default encoding, to use UTF-8\n- Same for `InputStreamReader` and `OutputStreamWriter` constructors\n- Standardizes on UTF-8 everywhere\n- Standardizes specifying the encoding with `StandardCharsets.UTF-8`, not the Guava constant or \"UTF-8\" (which means handling `UnuspportedEncodingException`)\n- (also addresses the other remaining Coverity scan issues, which are pretty trivial; these are separated into commit https://github.com/srowen/spark/commit/1deecd8d9ca986d8adb1a42d315890ce5349d29c )\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPR #11443 temporarily disabled MiMA check, this PR re-enables it.\n\nOne extra change is that `object DataFrame` is also removed. The only purpose of introducing `object DataFrame` was to use it as an internal factory for creating `Dataset[Row]`. By replacing this internal factory with `Dataset.newDataFrame`, both `DataFrame` and `DataFrame$` are entirely removed from the API, so that we can simply put a `MissingClassProblem` filter in `MimaExcludes.scala` for most DataFrame API  changes.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by MiMA check triggered by Jenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-03-11T10:00:58Z","updated_at":"2016-03-13T11:36:39Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T14:19:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ddd119caee3156fc10c92285e83feb6ca825faf7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9dae7f882181aec159812ba77a9225345b223b87","head":{"label":"liancheng:re-enable-mima","ref":"re-enable-mima","sha":"9dae7f882181aec159812ba77a9225345b223b87","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe generate `IsNotNull` constraint for compound expressions. However, we should not add extra predicate conditions for these compound expressions. It will add extra costs for query processing. Normally, it will not filter out any row but requires extra processing. \n\nFor example, \n\n``` SQL\ntestRelation.where('a + 'b === 1)\n```\n\nWithout this PR, the plan will be like \n\n```\nFilter (((a#0 + b#0) = 1) && isnotnull((a#0 + b#0)))\n +- LocalRelation [a#0,b#0,c#0]\n```\n\nAfter the PR, constraints-generated null filtering of compound expressions will not be added.\n\n```\nFilter ((a#0 + b#0) = 1))\n +- LocalRelation [a#0,b#0,c#0]\n```\n\nThe solution is to remove the `IsNotNull` constraints for compound expressions. \n\nIn addition, this PR can generate `IsNotNull` constraints for all the `BinaryComparison` inside `Not` except `EqualNullSafe`.\n\ncc @sameeragarwal @nongli @marmbrus \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case for Filter and another case for Join\n","created_at":"2016-03-11T06:48:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T05:21:42Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T05:21:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cf6a9609cc3f4806311b813176d8cbf38a72cd98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11649/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11649/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11649/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/55155a76f9e7e01d85819352b3e0852d7b6f6a20","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:compoundNullFilter","ref":"compoundNullFilter","sha":"55155a76f9e7e01d85819352b3e0852d7b6f6a20","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13658\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nQuoted from JIRA description: When run TPCDS Q3 [1] with lots predicates to filter out the partitions, the optimizer rule BooleanSimplification take about 2 seconds (it use lots of sematicsEqual, which require copy the whole tree).\n\nIt will great if we could speedup it.\n\n[1] https://github.com/cloudera/impala-tpcds-kit/blob/master/queries/q3.sql\n\nHow to speed up it:\n\nWhen we ask the canonicalized expression in `Expression`, it calls `Canonicalize.execute` on itself. `Canonicalize.execute` basically transforms up all expressions included in this expression. However, we don't keep the canonicalized versions for these children expressions. So in next time we ask the canonicalized expressions for the children expressions (e.g., `BooleanSimplification`), we will rerun `Canonicalize.execute` on each of them. It wastes much time.\n\nBy forcing the children expressions to get and keep their canonicalized versions first, we can avoid re-canonicalize these expressions.\n\nI simply benchmark it with an expression which is part of the where clause in TPCDS Q3:\n\n```\nval testRelation = LocalRelation('ss_sold_date_sk.int, 'd_moy.int, 'i_manufact_id.int, 'ss_item_sk.string, 'i_item_sk.string,

PR adds a new strategy, `FileSourceStrategy`, that can be used for planning scans of collections of files that might be partitioned or bucketed.\n\nCompared with the existing planning logic in `DataSourceStrategy` this version has the following desirable properties:\n- It removes the need to have `RDD`, `broadcastedHadoopConf` and other distributed concerns  in the public API of `org.apache.spark.sql.sources.FileFormat`\n- Partition column appending is delegated to the format to avoid an extra copy / devectorization when appending partition columns\n- It minimizes the amount of data that is shipped to each executor (i.e. it does not send the whole list of files to every worker in the form of a hadoop conf)\n- it natively supports bucketing files into partitions, and thus does not require coalescing / creating a `UnionRDD` with the correct partitioning.\n- Small files are automatically coalesced into fewer tasks using an approximate bin-packing algorithm.\n\nCurrently only a testing source is planned / tested using this strategy.  In follow-up PRs we will port the existing formats to this API.\n\nA stub for `FileScanRDD` is also added, but most methods remain unimplemented.\n\nOther minor cleanups:\n- partition pruning is pushed into `FileCatalog` so both the new and old code paths can use this logic.  This will also allow future implementations to use indexes or other tricks (i.e. a MySQL metastore)\n- The partitions from the `FileCatalog` now propagate information about file sizes all the way up to the planner so we can intelligently spread files out.\n- `Array` -> `Seq` in some internal APIs to avoid unnecessary `toArray` calls\n- Rename `Partition` to `PartitionDirectory` to differentiate partitions used earlier in pruning from those where we have already enumerated the files and their

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nContinuousQueryManager is sometimes flaky on Jenkins.

I have increased the wait time in the hope that it will be less flaky.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI reran the unit test many times on a loop in my machine.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR generates code that get a value in each column from `ColumnVector` instead of creating `InternalRow` when `ColumnarBatch` is accessed. This PR improves benchmark program by up to 15%.\nThis PR consists of two parts:\n1. Get an `ColumnVector` by using `ColumnarBatch.column()` method\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nLet's start with an example:\n\n```\nval df = ...\nval df2 = df.filter(...)\ndf.join(df2, (df(\"key\") + 1) === df2(\"key\"))\n```\n\nThis query won't work and returns wrong result as `df(\"key\")` and `df2(\"key\")` reference to a same column.\n\nI think the biggest problem is, we give users the resolved attribute. However, resolved attribute is not real column, as logical plan's output may change. For example, we will generate new output for the right child in self-join.\n\nWe should make `Dataset.col` return unresolved attribute, and still do the resolution to make sure the given column name is resolvable, but don't return the resolved one, just get the name out and wrap it with UnresolvedAttribute.\n\nWe should also alias every single `Dataset` ever generated, with a globally unique name, so that `Dataset.col` will return an unresolved attribute with a unique qualifier, and our framework can reference the corrected column with it.\n\nWhen we alias a `Dataset`, we should clean out previously generated aliases, to avoid making the plan tree too big.\n\nNow if users run the query again, it works.\n\nThere are 3 exceptional cases that we should not alias:\n1. `Dataset.as`: this is obvious, we can't override user-provided alias.\n2. `Dataset.toDF()`: this just turns a strongly typed `Dataset` to generic `DataFrame`, not creating a new one, no need to alias.\n3. `join`: `join` is very special, it may have same-name outputs with different qualifiers, so we can't alias it as we will replace the original qualifiers and make the same-name outputs un-distinguishable. We can't clean out previously generated aliases either, as it will erase the original qualifiers.\n\nHowever, if users manually introduce ambiguity, this PR will break existing code, for example:\n\n```\nval df1 = ....  // schema: [id, name]\nval df2 = ....  // schema: [id, age]\nval left = df1.as(\"same\")\nval right = df2.as(\"same\")\nleft.join(right, left(\"id\") === right(\"id\"))\n```\n\nIt will fail analysis after this PR, because the 2 `id` columns have same qualifier.\n\nThis PR also breaks some corner cases that works before, but I think it's good to break it:\n\n```\nval df = ...\nval df1 = df.filter(...)\ndf1.select(df(\"key\"))\n```\n\nIt will throw an exception now, because we can't resolve `df(\"key\")` based on `df1`. I think this is reasonable, `df` and `df1` are different `Dataset`s, it's weird to support select a column from different `Dataset`. Another case:\n\n```\nval df = ...\ndf.join(df, df(\"key\") === df(\"key\"))\n```\n\nIt doesn't make sense to support self-join in this way, users should use `df.join(df, \"key\")`. And this trick is very fragile, it stops working if we do some operation on the column, e.g. `df.join(df, (df(\"key\") + 1) === df(\"key\"))`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-10T11:08:46Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T16:39:57Z","closed_at":"2016-06-03T16:39:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14df7a4cc57516d7fcc10a8379a552f807b127ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1822dad0b9f9515a23fc853ca95d39524c0ffc4","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:df-self-join","ref":"df-self-join","sha":"a1822dad0b9f9515a23fc853ca95d39524c0ffc4","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror
