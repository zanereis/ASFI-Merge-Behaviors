What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nSpark 2.4 changed it's Scala version from 2.11.8 to 2.11.12 (see SPARK-24418).\r\n\r\nThere are two problems for this upgrade at Zeppelin side:\r\n\r\n1.. Some methods that are used in private by reflection, for instance, `loopPostInit` became inaccessible.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n - https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.8/src/repl/scala/tools/nsc/interpreter/ILoop.scala\r\n - https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.12/src/repl/scala/tools/nsc/interpreter/ILoop.scala\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I manually ported `loopPostInit` at 2.11.8 to retain the behaviour. Some functions that are commonly existing at both Scala 2.11.8 and Scala 2.11.12 are used inside of the new `loopPostInit` by reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.. Upgrade from 2.11.8 to 2.11.12 requires `jline.version` upgrade. Otherwise, we will hit:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: \r\njline.console.completer.CandidateListCompletionHandler.setPrintSpaceAfterFullCompletion(Z)V\r\n  at scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.jline.JLineConsoleReader.initCompletion(JLineReader.scala:139)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I tweaked this by upgrading jline from `2.12.1` to `2.14.3`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Wait until Spark 2.4.0 is officially released.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3810\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nVerified manually against Spark 2.4.0 RC3\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR is reopening of https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3121 \r\nIt would be nice if we could change thread pool size for scheduler dynamically.\r\n\r\n### Using this feature:\r\n1. Create file `quartz.properties` from default file located in `org.quartz` and add them to `conf` directory\r\n2. Notice, that **org.quartz.threadPool.threadPriority** and **org.quartz.threadPool.threadsInheritContextClassLoaderOfInitializingThread** are not implemented in **ExecutorServiceThreadPool** so these options should be deleted from the file\r\n3. In `quartz.properties` set `org.quartz.threadPool.class` to `org.apache.zeppelin.scheduler.dynamic_pool.impl.ExecutorServiceThreadPool`\r\n\r\nOtherwise you will get message \"Thread pool size is constant.\"\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3694\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Tests added\r\n* Tested manually\r\n* [CI pass](https://travis-ci.org/TinkoffCreditSystems/zeppelin/builds/441237953)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nFirstly, when thread pool size equals `1` notes wait for each other, but when scheduler thread pool size changed to `2` they start to work in parallel.\r\n\r\n![cron mp4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136993/43912629-77707ad4-9c0b-11e8-9d6c-62cbc67568a8.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?  No\r\nI added sources of [quartz-dynamic-pool](https://github.com/epiresdasilva/quartz-dynamic-pool) developed by @epiresdasilva, because this repo isn't included in http://mvnrepository.com\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes, REST API docs updated\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-14T11:41:20Z","updated_at":"2019-01-27T13:29:52Z","closed_at":"2018-11-19T00:59:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c928556fd45825c9b1479707ffdfe0d4e194920","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/b751ea79df1f4766d755abcf660a614e6c3ff935","head":{"label":"Tinkoff:DW-17795","ref":"DW-17795","sha":"b751ea79df1f4766d755abcf660a614e6c3ff935","user":{"login":"Tinkoff","id":5486989,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU0ODY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5486989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff","html_url":"https://github.com/Tinkoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82160007,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjE2MDAwNw==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Tinkoff/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tinkoff","id":5486989,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU0ODY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5486989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff","html_url":"https://github.com/Tinkoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinkoff/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Tinkoff/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nBump Up the Shiro version in zeppelin from 1.3.2 to 1.4.0. Bumping up the Shiro version will help in using the newer pac4j versions. This will also help in integrating Zeppelin and OpenID Connect using latest versions of pac4j. Pac4j also mentions that it is compatible with Shiro 1.4 version.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nZEPPELIN-3791\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n**Basic User Authentication**\r\n\r\n- Use the attached Basic Shiro.ini file\r\n- Start Zeppelin with \"bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start\"\r\n- Using browser open zeppelin UI\r\n- Try login using user1/password2 - Login successful \r\n- Try login using user1/wrong - Login fails as expected\r\n\r\n**Testing with KeyCloak - Based on Shiro + Pac4j + buij-pac4j**\r\n\r\n- Use the attached keycloakshiro.ini which uses the zeppelin realm and zeppelin-client\r\n- Copy the dependency jars to zeppelin lib folder (list of jars attached)\r\n- Configure keycloak with realms and users matching keycloakshiro.ini\r\n- Start Zeppelin with \"bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start\".\r\n- Using browser open zeppelin UI\r\n- You will be redirected to Keycloak UI. \r\n- Try login using username/password registered in keycloak - success\r\n- Try login using user/wrongPassword -  Login fails as expected\r\nFor more details related to Zeppelin keycloak integration refer to

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen running zeppelin behind a firewall the default maven central _without_ proxy is always checked first, which makes dependency downloading unusable - for every pom, jar the timeout of the request against maven central adds up to the total time of downloading the dependencies, even if a repository with proxy is added (made possible in ZEPPELIN-1376)\r\n\r\nThis commit adds additional properties / environment variables that set the proxy on the default repository  \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Is the modification of org.apache.zeppelin.conf.ZeppelinConfiguration really necessary? The properties are never referenced anywhere and not used in Booter \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3772\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* In a proxy environment\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? \r\n  no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? \r\n  no\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\n  Currently the default repository is not documented somewhere. Maybe this should be changed?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThe custom interpreter may add other dependencies which conflict with zeppelin-interpreter's dependency, so it is better to shade zeppelin-interpreter's dependencies.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improve]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] Add new module interpreter-api to shade all dependencies of zeppelin-interpreter\r\n* [x] Add maven-shade-plugin to interpreter-api/pom.xml\r\n* [x] Add maven-surefire-plugin to interpreter-api/pom.xml\r\n* [x] Filter META-INF/*.SF, META-INF/*.DSA, META-INF/*.RSA\r\n* [x] Zeppelin-interpreter dependency interpreter-api module\r\n* [x] Exclude the interpreter-api module in the interpreter-parent/pom file to avoid dependency package conflicts\r\n* [x] Exclude the interpreter-api module in the zeppelin-display/pom file to avoid dependency package conflicts\r\n* [x] Exclude the interpreter-api module in the zeppelin-zengine/pom file to avoid dependency package conflicts\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3689\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n[CI pass](https://travis-ci.org/liuxunorg/zeppelin/builds/424738996)\r\n\r\n###

What is this PR for?\r\n**New Hazelcast Jet interpreter**\r\n\r\nZeppelin has interpreters for different data processing systems like Flink, Spark, Kylin, Ignite, Geode, Beam, etc.\r\n\r\nHazelcast Jet is a general purpose distributed data processing engine, built on top of Hazelcast for stream/batch processing, comparable if not better in terms of performance to the engine supported by Zeppelin therefore a perfect candidate for a Zeppelin interpreter.\r\n\r\nPart of the interpreter is to have a set of utility methods that print out Hazelcast data structures (IMap and ICache) and leverage Zeppelin's built in visualization (%table).\r\n\r\nWhat's more, a nice addition is to have the Hazelcast Jet DAG of the pipeline displayed as a network graph using %network display system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n* Feature \r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* Utility method to display Hazelcast Jet DAG  using %network\r\n* Review zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE file\r\n* Any feedback from reviewers\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-3654]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nManually\r\n* Start the Zeppelin server\r\n* Create a new note with the hazelcastjet interpreter binding\r\n* Write an Hazelcast Jet job as per documentation (docs/interpreter/hazelcastjet.md)\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n* Run unit tests (HazelcastJetInterpreterTest.java)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\nYes, added Apache License for Hazelcast Jet.\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nNo.\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\nYes, it has been added to the PR, see docs/interpreter/hazelcastjet.md.","created_at":"2018-08-21T20:57:41Z","updated_at":"2018-09-26T10:24:10Z","closed_at":"2018-09-26T09:38:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45a576364f234bd6afb93e869e526c23e72f9a0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/23a95669fdbbb8ea47190d2a350ab13ab410dc29","head":{"label":"selvinsource:hazelcast-jet-interpreter","ref":"hazelcast-jet-interpreter","sha":"23a95669fdbbb8ea47190d2a350ab13ab410dc29","user":{"login":"selvinsource","id":7315093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTUwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7315093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource","html_url":"https://github.com/selvinsource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140843837,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA4NDM4Mzc=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"selvinsource/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"selvinsource","id":7315093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTUwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7315093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource","html_url":"https://github.com/selvinsource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvinsource/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/selvinsource/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

No\r\nI added sources of [quartz-dynamic-pool](https://github.com/epiresdasilva/quartz-dynamic-pool) developed by @epiresdasilva, because this repo isn't included in http://mvnrepository.com\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes, REST API docs

\r\n### What is this PR for?\r\nThis is a continuation of [3102](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3102)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could get PID of running interpreter, and group of paragraphs that running under that interpreter, using API and JMX.\r\n\r\nUsing this feature it will be easy to check CPU and memory load, etc. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds:\r\n* API method to get info about running interpreters (`/api/interpreter/running`);\r\n* API method to get info about running paragraphs grouped by interpreters (`/api/notebook/jobmanager/running`);\r\n* Few JMX methods which do the same as API;\r\n* Template for simple running paragraphs analysis using API.\r\n\r\nPart of discussion from previous PR:\r\n> author: @zjffdu \r\n> Thanks @egorklimov , this is an interesting feature.\r\n> This assume all the interpreter process will generate pid file, but this assumption is not true. There's 2 exceptions at least for now. One is yarn-cluster mode of spark where the interpreter runs in remote node of yarn cluster. Another is running interpreter in container which is on our roadmap. Do you have any ideas of how to handle these 2 scenarios ?\r\n\r\n> author: @egorklimov\r\n> If I'm not mistaken according to `bin/interpreter.sh:234-238`:\r\n> ```\r\n> if [[ -z \"${pid}\" ]]; then\r\n>   exit 1;\r\n> else\r\n>   echo ${pid} > ${ZEPPELIN_PID}\r\n> fi\r\n> ``` \r\n> Pid file generates every time (except case when interpreter process didn't start successfully). But in yarn scenario it will be hard to analyze CPU and memory load because resources will be consumed on each node, maybe someone will add one more template for that case.\r\n> \r\n> In case of container, I suppose we could generate other info in run folder.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nIssue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3671\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Tests added.\r\n* Tested manually\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nExample of tables built on response data:\r\n* Interpreters:\r\n![intp-table-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136993/43404050-3e123f3c-941f-11e8-9223-056cd0d96adf.png)\r\n* Paragraphs:\r\n![running-paragraphs-info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136993/43404049-3df6ee58-941f-11e8-9e7e-d60a1859a7de.png)\r\n\r\nTree of processes associated with running:\r\n![tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136993/43412312-86ec9ce6-9435-11e8-8a1c-8f9d8bef4f94.png)\r\n\r\nThe same data using JMX (viewed in jconsole):\r\n\r\n* Running interpreters:\r\n![jconsole2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136993/43408918-2a31b306-942b-11e8-9a51-f2cf78f52a8c.png)\r\n* Running paragraphs\r\n![jconsole-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136993/43408919-2a550478-942b-11e8-854d-7281615f1b17.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?
