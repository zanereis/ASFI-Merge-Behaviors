easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-12T11:19:55Z","updated_at":"2024-06-14T03:07:24Z","closed_at":"2024-06-14T03:07:24Z","merged_at":"2024-06-14T03:07:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"e49b8b241191fc6bd2b3ab5b3fcdcc855a541879","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/110062516f8f74b9546b5d777effc4b888a4ee52","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.3-handle-header-end_stream","ref":"3.3-handle-header-end_stream","sha":"110062516f8f74b9546b5d777effc4b888a4ee52","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-11T12:19:23Z","updated_at":"2024-06-12T01:57:13Z","closed_at":"2024-06-12T01:57:13Z","merged_at":"2024-06-12T01:57:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4fa369b29a95200ccf331c247eaa8a106fe502a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f2d84c90160fbb62537d041b9da32ca41b57848d","head":{"label":"icodening:serialization_check","ref":"serialization_check","sha":"f2d84c90160fbb62537d041b9da32ca41b57848d","user":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460051832,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2vVeA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icodening/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icodening/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-05T14:59:51Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T19:11:45Z","closed_at":"2024-06-06T06:39:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"999ed93fe544b95aaad62a93185c69ffca89f4bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e01ee6eb1f8000dd50163f5ff5f3f1b87e90e928","head":{"label":"heliang666s:3.3.6","ref":"3.3.6","sha":"e01ee6eb1f8000dd50163f5ff5f3f1b87e90e928","user":{"login":"heliang666s","id":147408835,"node_id":"U_kgDOCMlHww","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147408835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s","html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":783569232,"node_id":"R_kgDOLrRRUA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"heliang666s/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"heliang666s","id":147408835,"node_id":"U_kgDOCMlHww","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147408835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s","html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-04T03:04:37Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T12:39:53Z","closed_at":"2024-06-04T04:54:45Z","merged_at":"2024-06-04T04:54:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"473ea36b04d93e2efc439848ff65ec5b3bee06d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/dfd6a2a0b92fc5d13ad99913f9e8e1519290ae75","head":{"label":"aofall:3.2-zk-ensemble-tracker","ref":"3.2-zk-ensemble-tracker","sha":"dfd6a2a0b92fc5d13ad99913f9e8e1519290ae75","user":{"login":"aofall","id":10182210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTgyMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10182210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall","html_url":"https://github.com/aofall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":709196611,"node_id":"R_kgDOKkV7Qw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"aofall/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aofall","id":10182210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTgyMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10182210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall","html_url":"https://github.com/aofall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aofall/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the [official document](https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/mannual/java-sdk/reference-manual/config/properties/#protocol) the option of `dubbo.protocol.accesslog` can be set as string/boolean type. While it's true value, it will active accesslog and write to the default path currently, but while it's false value, it will still active and write accesslog and output the warning.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/10182210/7e3cf32d-b10b-44db-8c36-6dae5bb2b290)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\ndisable accesslog while the config of dubbo.protocol.accesslog is false\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n\r\nsee https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/14253     and dubbo 3.3 pr see

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-28T10:03:20Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T10:05:29Z","closed_at":"2024-05-30T10:05:28Z","merged_at":"2024-05-30T10:05:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d1671ef80edaf6222b7290fc0d91cc2c7647e02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14248/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14248/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14248/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c2782e0c7b7aa7646362ba6c347146827eda4a16","head":{"label":"qyi71:feat/redis_up","ref":"feat/redis_up","sha":"c2782e0c7b7aa7646362ba6c347146827eda4a16","user":{"login":"qyi71","id":78294896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4Mjk0ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78294896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71","html_url":"https://github.com/qyi71","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":806476182,"node_id":"R_kgDOMBHZlg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"qyi71/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qyi71","id":78294896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4Mjk0ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78294896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71","html_url":"https://github.com/qyi71","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qyi71/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qyi71/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-24T06:10:17Z","updated_at":"2024-05-27T03:55:49Z","closed_at":"2024-05-27T03:55:48Z","merged_at":"2024-05-27T03:55:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"5dceb96c6b9064f1e02fc065e9cbc0f908cdc6e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/802589a5d4e5855be4ef2cb8dd84fda7b32b3815","head":{"label":"hanydd:dev-3.3-typo","ref":"dev-3.3-typo","sha":"802589a5d4e5855be4ef2cb8dd84fda7b32b3815","user":{"login":"hanydd","id":31091101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDkxMTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31091101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd","html_url":"https://github.com/hanydd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":805219791,"node_id":"R_kgDOL_6tzw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"hanydd/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanydd","id":31091101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDkxMTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31091101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd","html_url":"https://github.com/hanydd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanydd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanydd/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-21T06:01:42Z","updated_at":"2024-05-21T10:57:10Z","closed_at":"2024-05-21T10:57:10Z","merged_at":"2024-05-21T10:57:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc95b52dfbed87cdcf72a3ab1176329c36595604","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/af36224bb7f7875bad8bb73654e9e7f0dc601f29","head":{"label":"wcy666103:com.google.code.gson-gson-2.11.0","ref":"com.google.code.gson-gson-2.11.0","sha":"af36224bb7f7875bad8bb73654e9e7f0dc601f29","user":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":780361800,"node_id":"R_kgDOLoNgSA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wcy666103/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-20T09:50:23Z","updated_at":"2024-05-21T03:29:28Z","closed_at":"2024-05-21T03:29:27Z","merged_at":"2024-05-21T03:29:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"b95695bf4fcd4473bc01b25fbb85ea32a837ce27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ca804e5e758335f5e17b6cbaa431fd6ea4d2786e","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.3-add-ErrorResponse-serialize-check","ref":"3.3-add-ErrorResponse-serialize-check","sha":"ca804e5e758335f5e17b6cbaa431fd6ea4d2786e","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

Purpose of the Change\r\nThis PR introduces a new version of `MetadataService` (V2) based on Protobuf, which provides better compatibility with dubbo-go.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/13584\r\n\r\n## Brief Changelog\r\nTo use `MetadataServiceV2`, the application must meet the following requirements:\r\n* The application has imported Protobuf dependencies.\r\n* `metadataServiceProtocol` is configured as 'tri', or at least one service is using the triple protocol.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `MetadataServiceV2` will automatically export along with `MetadataService` (V1, on the same port) if the above requirements are **satisfied**.

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfixed #14207 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. split property name to fragments by dot char.\r\n2. deny the property name if securityKey list contains the last fragment of the property name based on kebab-case comparison.\r\nrefer to  URLParam#removeParameters using by AbstractConfiguratorListener#genConfiguratorsFromRawRule.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-18T03:55:28Z","updated_at":"2024-05-21T02:20:51Z","closed_at":"2024-05-21T02:20:51Z","merged_at":"2024-05-21T02:20:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"e21244a43171c0187b0295fd9ba811155ebb1acd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14208/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14208/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14208/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/afa25439bb9800fd40274aaae60599c4dea292ad","head":{"label":"zrlw:3.2-feature-fixedSecurityKeyComparion","ref":"3.2-feature-fixedSecurityKeyComparion","sha":"afa25439bb9800fd40274aaae60599c4dea292ad","user":{"login":"zrlw","id":40652892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjUyODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40652892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw","html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":382837484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODI4Mzc0ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zrlw/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zrlw","id":40652892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjUyODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40652892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw","html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-16T09:12:59Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T09:19:13Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"23cf529296f25156230947e4b34481e22a7a33da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14201/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14201/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14201/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/187c4daa241e0ca5e57366a55158b65821da7872","head":{"label":"zrlw:3.2-feature-buildUniqueMappingKey","ref":"3.2-feature-buildUniqueMappingKey","sha":"187c4daa241e0ca5e57366a55158b65821da7872","user":{"login":"zrlw","id":40652892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjUyODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40652892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw","html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":382837484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODI4Mzc0ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zrlw/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zrlw","id":40652892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjUyODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40652892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw","html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw/dubbo","description":"Apache

(usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1. In the newer versions of Hibernate-validator, the package names of the relevant validation implementation classes have been migrated from `javax` to `jakarta`. \r\nDubbo has been support new validator with jakarta in #9552 , but the setting of default validator is implement with javax, if the user is not configured to use a new validator under the SpringBoot3, an `NoClassDefFoundError` will be throw.\r\nIf the validator supports automatic switch, this will reduce a lot of configuration processes for users. So Add an adapter that it can automatically switch.\r\n\r\n2. If user fill in any characters into `dubbo.provider/consumer.validation` configuration that the validation extension not exists, the validation will active the default validator. \r\nBut in the [official documentation](https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/mannual/java-sdk/reference-manual/config/properties/) the parameter type of `dubbo.provider.validation` and `dubbo.consumer.validation` is described as Boolean, it's unexpect that user fill in the `false` parameter. \r\nSupport disabling validation when parameter is 'false' that it is expected the description in document the parameter type is boolean\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1.

Support disabling validation when parameter is 'false' that it is expected the description in document the parameter type is boolean\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-16T01:27:37Z","updated_at":"2024-05-22T03:12:01Z","closed_at":"2024-05-22T03:12:00Z","merged_at":"2024-05-22T03:12:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"83682624061f8adf04e346917cf37007d83d1ffc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14194/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14194/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14194/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/19f7759ff8aabc30f3690df73bc0951b4df3126f","head":{"label":"aofall:3.3-validation-module","ref":"3.3-validation-module","sha":"19f7759ff8aabc30f3690df73bc0951b4df3126f","user":{"login":"aofall","id":10182210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTgyMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10182210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall","html_url":"https://github.com/aofall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":709196611,"node_id":"R_kgDOKkV7Qw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"aofall/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aofall","id":10182210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTgyMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10182210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall","html_url":"https://github.com/aofall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aofall/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nWhen native http2 sends a request, it is possible to send 1-2 data frames:\r\n1. The data frame is sent together with the endStream identifier\r\n2. The data frame and endStream identifier are sent separately.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, when a data frame with the endStream identifier is received and the data is empty, the parameters will be set to null. Loss of parameters will cause the call to fail.\r\n\r\nReceiving the end_stream flag means that the unary data stream is complete and can be decoded.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

#14171.\r\n\r\n# The Problem\r\n\r\nFollowup of #14135 - fixing more non-idempotent unit tests (tests that pass in the first run but fails in repeated runs in the same environment in isolation)\r\n\r\n# All Non-Idempotent Tests & Proposed Fix\r\n## ClassGeneratorTest#test and ClassGeneratorTest#testMain0\r\nReason: Similar as described in https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/14135, these tests employs the ClassGenerator to configure a custom class with **hard-coded names**, and then invokes `ClassGenerator.toClass()` to instantiate the desired `Class<?>` object. However, within `ClassGenerator.toClass()`, the invoked method `javassist.ClassPool.makeClass()` is called to create the class. Given that Javassist freezes a class upon its initial loading (ensuring classes cannot be altered or removed at runtime), repeated invocations of the two unit tests fail as the class names remain unchanged, leading to class generation errors.\r\n\r\nError message of one of the tests in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.dubbo.common.bytecode.Bean$Builder: frozen class (cannot edit)\r\n```\r\nFix: Assign a unique ID to each class to be generated in the same classloader.\r\n\r\n## ChannelHandlerDispatcherTest#test\r\nReason: The `MockChannelHandler` class has stores metrics like `sentCount` and `connectedCount` as static variables. However, there're no reset methods to clear these metrics after a round of test execution. Therefore, in the repeated runs, metrics like `sentCount` will be an accumulative count across multiple test runs. This will make the assertions fail.\r\n\r\nError message in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <4> but was: <2>\r\n```\r\nFix: Add a `reset()` methods to clear all metrics, and call this `reset()` method after each test execution.\r\n\r\n## RpcStatusTest#testStatistics, RpcStatusTest#testBeginCountEndCount and RpcStatusTest#testBeginCountEndCountInMultiThread\r\nReason: For each test method, `RpcStatus` records metrics retrieved by methods like `getTotal()`. However, the metrics are not reset before the repeated runs of the same test method, so the values returned by methods like `getTotal()` would be an accumulative count of multiple test runs, causing the assertions fail.\r\n\r\nError message of one of the tests in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <8> but was: <4>\r\n```\r\nFix: Call `RpcStatus.removeStatus()` to reset the metrics corresponding to the url and the method name for each test at the start of test execution.\r\n\r\n## DubboMonitorTest#testMonitorFactory\r\nReason: `monitorFactory.getMonitor()` uses the hard-coded port number `17979`. However, the port will be occupied by the first test execution, so repeated run will fail to start the server since the address has already been used.\r\n\r\nError message:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.dubbo.rpc.RpcException: Fail to start server(url: dubbo://127.0.0.1:17979/org.apache.dubbo.monitor.MonitorService?channel.readonly.sent=true&codec=dubbo&heartbeat=60000) Failed to bind NettyServer on /0.0.0.0:17979, cause: Address already in use\r\n```\r\n\r\nFix: Find a free port using `java.net.ServerSocket` and use it.\r\n\r\n## PrometheusMetricsThreadPoolTest#testExporterThreadpoolName and PrometheusMetricsReporterTest#testExporter\r\nReason: The tests attempt to create a `prometheusExporterHttpServer` in each execution. However, in the first execution, the server is created but not shut down after execution. Therefore, repeated test executions will throw a runtime exception since the address corresponding to the server is already in use.\r\n\r\nError Message:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.BindException: Address already in use\r\n```\r\n\r\nFix: Extract `prometheusExporterHttpServer` as a field and stop it in the `tearDown()` method to ensure each test execution starts with a fresh state.\r\n\r\n## Register Center Integration Tests\r\n- `MultipleRegistryCenterInjvmIntegrationTest#integrate`\r\n- `SingleRegistryCenterInjvmIntegrationTest#integrate`\r\n- `MultipleRegistryCenterExportMetadataIntegrationTest#integrate`\r\n- `SingleRegistryCenterExportMetadataIntegrationTest#integrate`\r\n- `MultipleRegistryCenterServiceDiscoveryRegistryIntegrationTest#integrate`\r\n- `MultipleRegistryCenterExportProviderIntegrationTest#integrate`\r\n- `SingleRegistryCenterExportProviderIntegrationTest#integrate`\r\nReason: These integration tests set the static string `PROVIDER_APPLICATION_NAME` to `null` in its `tearDown()` method. This causes repeated runs to fail to find the corresponding configuration. There's really no need to clear `PROVIDER_APPLICATION_NAME` in the reset method since each integration test class has its globally unique provide application name and they're not interdependent on each other.\r\n\r\nError Message:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: No application config found or it's not a valid config! Please add <dubbo:application name=\"...\" /> to your spring config.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFix: Do not set `PROVIDER_APPLICATION_NAME` to `null` when tearing down.\r\n\r\n## ReferenceCacheTest#testGetCacheDiffReference\r\nReason: Though the `XxxMockReferenceConfig` instance `configCopy` is re-constructed in each test execution, the `configCopy.getCounter()` will return accumulative counts across different runs since `counter` is static (of global scope). Therefore, the assertion `assertEquals(0L, configCopy.getCounter());` will fail in repeated runs.\r\n\r\nError Message:\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <0> but was: <1>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFix: Call `XxxMockReferenceConfig.setCounter(0)` in the `setUp()` method.\r\n\r\n## LiveTest#testExecute\r\nReason: The test sets the check return value of `MockLivenessProbe` to `true` during the test execution, but does not reset it back to `false` when the test finishes.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/14104.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nThe method `org.apache.dubbo.config.spring.util.AnnotationUtils#tryGetMergedAnnotation` utilizes reflection to access `org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation`. However, there is a signature mismatch in the method's input parameters, which leads to an inability to retrieve the correct method. Consequently, this results in the failure to obtain the mergedAnnotation.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIt is recommended to fix this issue, as it will cause the passing of the `DubboReference` annotation to become ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nfix the signature error when using reflection to access the org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation method\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAfter the patch, it is possible to correctly obtain the `org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation` method.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-06T12:33:56Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T07:20:55Z","closed_at":"2024-05-08T07:20:54Z","merged_at":"2024-05-08T07:20:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d916cd2c10ad3f21290bf25e338261c30cafbad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14156/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14156/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14156/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3357ba469640bab0eca934451ba84625085d1c71","head":{"label":"jkoChen:fix/fix_try_get_merged_annotation_error","ref":"fix/fix_try_get_merged_annotation_error","sha":"3357ba469640bab0eca934451ba84625085d1c71","user":{"login":"jkoChen","id":37362859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzYyODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37362859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen","html_url":"https://github.com/jkoChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":796486187,"node_id":"R_kgDOL3lqKw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jkoChen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkoChen","id":37362859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzYyODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37362859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen","html_url":"https://github.com/jkoChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkoChen/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-06T09:49:56Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T12:28:12Z","closed_at":"2024-05-06T12:28:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"423f733320a70c2d40e1a9b8f5844a2201cc5cdd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6ce3cd30d1da1a54d8b02f505ba049be6914babb","head":{"label":"jkoChen:test_cases","ref":"test_cases","sha":"6ce3cd30d1da1a54d8b02f505ba049be6914babb","user":{"login":"jkoChen","id":37362859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzYyODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37362859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen","html_url":"https://github.com/jkoChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":796486187,"node_id":"R_kgDOL3lqKw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jkoChen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkoChen","id":37362859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzYyODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37362859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen","html_url":"https://github.com/jkoChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkoChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkoChen/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/14104.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nThe method `org.apache.dubbo.config.spring.util.AnnotationUtils#tryGetMergedAnnotation` utilizes reflection to access `org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation`. However, there is a signature mismatch in the method's input parameters, which leads to an inability to retrieve the correct method. Consequently, this results in the failure to obtain the mergedAnnotation.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIt is recommended to fix this issue, as it will cause the passing of the `DubboReference` annotation to become ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nfix the signature error when using reflection to access the org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation method\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAfter the patch, it is possible to correctly obtain the `org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation` method.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/14104.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nThe method `org.apache.dubbo.config.spring.util.AnnotationUtils#tryGetMergedAnnotation` utilizes reflection to access `org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation`. However, there is a signature mismatch in the method's input parameters, which leads to an inability to retrieve the correct method. Consequently, this results in the failure to obtain the mergedAnnotation.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIt is recommended to fix this issue, as it will cause the passing of the `DubboReference` annotation to become ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nfix the signature error when using reflection to access the org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation method\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAfter the patch, it is possible to correctly obtain the `org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotatedElementUtils#getMergedAnnotation` method.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue.

before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-30T14:41:25Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T10:45:04Z","closed_at":"2024-07-22T10:45:03Z","merged_at":"2024-07-22T10:45:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"1916666146ed257bbb0f519eed3f2164a32438f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14148/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14148/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14148/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/80a1f205b58483fb1c56c706be390125213d5dff","head":{"label":"fanlobu:3.3_rest_jaxrs_paramconvert","ref":"3.3_rest_jaxrs_paramconvert","sha":"80a1f205b58483fb1c56c706be390125213d5dff","user":{"login":"fanlobu","id":74862058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODYyMDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74862058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu","html_url":"https://github.com/fanlobu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":789678202,"node_id":"R_kgDOLxGIeg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"fanlobu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fanlobu","id":74862058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODYyMDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74862058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu","html_url":"https://github.com/fanlobu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanlobu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fanlobu/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
