However, it always contains `AttributeReference`, because metadata columns are \"pre-resolved\" by nodes implementing `ExposesMetadataColumns`. \r\n\r\nWe can simplify a bunch of code by actually defining `metadataOutput` as a `Seq[AttributeReference]`.\r\n* `ExposesMetadataColumns` becomes simpler for a node to implement, because attribute identification and dedup can be factored out in a helper method, and implementing nodes only need a way to copy themselves with updated output. \r\n* `AddMetadataColumns` rule can be cleaned up as well with the bonus of eliminating unnecessary metadata column projections it used to impose.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCode cleanup.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change improves the handling of constant and generated metadata fields in `FileSourceStrategy`: instead of relying on hard-wired logic to categorize constant and generated metadata fields and process them, this change embeds the required information when creating them in `FileFormat` and uses this information in `FileSourceStrategy` to process arbitrary metadata fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change is a first step towards allowing file format implementations to inject their own metadata fields into plans.  The second step will be to change `FileScanRdd`/`FileFormat` to be able to populate values of arbitrary constant and generated metadata columns.\r\nOnce this is done, each file format will be able to declare and populate its own metadata field, e.g. `ParquetFileFormat` can provide the Parquet row index metadata field `ROW_INDEX` without polluting the `FileFormat`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this is strictly a refactor without any functional change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis change is covered by existing tests, e.p.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement CoGrouped Map API: `applyInPandas`.\r\n\r\nThe PR is a cherry-pick of https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/1fbc7948e57cbf05a46cb0c7fb2fad4ec25540e6, with minor changes on test class names to adapt to branch-3.4.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nParity with vanilla PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. CoGrouped Map API is supported as shown below.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> df1 = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith the while loop around service startup, any ENTER hit in the SimpleSparkConnectService console made it loop around, try to start the service anew, and fail with address already in use.\r\n\r\nChange the loop to be around the `StdIn.readline()` entry.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBetter testing / development / debugging with SparkConnect\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual use of

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOn the SQL page in the Web UI, this PR aims to add a repeat identifier to distinguish which InMemoryTableScan is being used at a certain location on the DAG. Ideally this would work in sync with changes from SPARK-42829.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there is no distinction for which InMemoryTableScan is being used at a specific point in the DAG.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, on the SQL page in the UI when there is a InMemoryTableScan. One example is\r\n<img width=\"1012\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-22 at 2 06 14 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16739760/227093764-618cee51-bd0a-4c27-9945-2cc122819c74.png\">\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test locally in SQL UI along with a few Unit Tests\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-23T03:23:10Z","updated_at":"2023-09-24T00:18:45Z","closed_at":"2023-09-24T00:18:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83496f7747c3f12c7985f6243fe2d253fce1106f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes `createDataFrame` to respect inference and column names.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently when a column name list is provided as a schema, the type inference result is not taken care of.\r\n\r\nAs a result, `createDataFrame` from UDT objects with column name list doesn't take the UDT type.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.ml.linalg import Vectors\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1.0, 1.0, Vectors.dense(0.0, 5.0)), (0.0, 2.0, Vectors.dense(1.0, 2.0))], [\"label\", \"weight\", \"features\"])\r\n>>> df.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- label: double (nullable = true)\r\n |-- weight: double (nullable = true)\r\n |-- features: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- type: byte (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- size: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- indices: array (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- element: integer (containsNull = false)\r\n |    |-- values: array (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- element: double (containsNull = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n, which should be:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- label: double (nullable = true)\r\n |-- weight: double (nullable = true)\r\n |-- features: vector (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests.","created_at":"2023-03-22T22:32:19Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T08:47:05Z","closed_at":"2023-03-23T08:45:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d62cea901a0e2976658c14d7188d534a76b97ab1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e82a98e8dcf01222a56eed9645d5f34b1fc29ef9","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-42900/cols","ref":"issues/SPARK-42900/cols","sha":"e82a98e8dcf01222a56eed9645d5f34b1fc29ef9","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support pandas API on Spark for Spark Connect. This PR includes minimal changes to support basic functionality of the pandas API in Spark Connect, and sets up a testing environment into `pyspark/pandas/tests/connect` using all existing pandas API on Spark test bases to test the functionality of the pandas API on Spark in a remote Spark session.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the key tasks:\r\n1. All pandas-on-Spark tests under the `python/pyspark/pandas/tests/` directory can now be performed in Spark Connect by adding corresponding tests to the `python/pyspark/pandas/tests/connect/` directory.\r\n2. Unlike with Spark SQL, we did not create a separate package directory such as `python/pyspark/sql/connect` for Spark Connect, so I modified the existing files of `pyspark.pandas`. This allows users to use the existing pandas-on-Spark code as it is on Spark Connect.\r\n3. Because of 2, I added two typing rules into `python/pyspark/pandas/_typing.py` for addressing both PySpark Column and Spark Connect Column in the single path.\r\n   - Added `GenericColumn` for typing both PySpark Column and Spark Connect Column.\r\n   - Added `GenericDataFrame` for typing both PySpark DataFrame and Spark Connect DataFrame.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBy supporting the pandas API in Spark Connect, it can significantly improve the usability for existing PySpark and pandas users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, because it is designed to allow existing code for regular Spark sessions to be used without any user-facing changes other than switching the regular Spark session to remote Spark session. However, since some features of the existing pandas API on Spark are not fully supported yet, some features may be limited.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA testing bed has been set up to reproduce all existing pandas-on-Spark tests for Spark Connect, ensuring that the existing tests can be replicated in Spark Connect. The current result for all tests as below:\r\n\r\n| Test file                                           | Test total | Test passed | Coverage |\r\n| ---------------------------------------------------

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis removes the need for a time zone id when casting from StringType -> DateType and DateType -> StringType.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is mostly for consistency with what the code is actually doing.  Marking it as needing A time zone id has no real impact to the actual execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI just compiled it for now.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds Ammonite REPL integration for Spark Connect. This has a couple of benefits:\r\n- It makes it a lot less cumbersome for users to start a spark connect REPL. You don't have to add custom scripts, and you can use `coursier` to launch a fully function REPL for you.\r\n- It adds REPL integration for to the actual build. This makes it easier to validate the code we add is actually working.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA REPL is arguably the first entry point for a lot of users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes it adds REPL integration.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests for the command line parsing. Manually tested the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBlock the usage of Arrow-optimized Python UDFs in Apache Spark 3.4.0. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nConsidering the upcoming improvements on the result inconsistencies between traditional Pickled Python UDFs and Arrow-optimized Python UDFs, we'd better block the feature, otherwise, users who try out the feature will expect behavior changes in the next release.\r\n\r\nIn addition, since Spark Connect Python Client(SCPC) has been introduced in Spark 3.4, we'd better ensure the feature is ready in both vanilla PySpark and SCPC at the same time for compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Arrow-optimized Python UDFs are blocked.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpgrade the [GCS Connector](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/tree/v2.2.11/gcs) bundled in the Spark distro from version 2.2.7 to 2.2.11.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe new release contains multiple bug fixes and enhancements discussed in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v2.2.11/gcs/CHANGES.md). Notable changes include:\r\n* Improved socket timeout handling.\r\n* Trace logging capabilities.\r\n* Fix bug that prevented usage of GCS as a [Hadoop Credential Provider](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CredentialProviderAPI.html).\r\n* Dependency upgrades.\r\n* Support OAuth2 based client authentication.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nDistributions built with `-Phadoop-cloud` now include GCS connector 2.2.11 instead of 2.2.7.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncnauroth@cnauroth-2-1-m:~/spark-3.5.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-custom-spark$ ls -lrt jars/gcs*\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 cnauroth cnauroth 36497606 Mar 21 00:42 jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-2.2.11-shaded.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n**Build**\r\n\r\nI built a custom distro with `-Phadoop-cloud`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./dev/make-distribution.sh --name custom-spark --pip --tgz -Phadoop-3 -Phadoop-cloud -Pscala-2.12\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Run**\r\n\r\nI ran a PySpark job that successfully reads and writes using GCS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\ndef main() -> None:\r\n  # Create SparkSession.\r\n  spark = (SparkSession.builder\r\n           .appName('copy-shakespeare')\r\n           .getOrCreate())\r\n\r\n  # Read.\r\n  df = spark.read.text('gs://dataproc-datasets-us-central1/shakespeare')\r\n\r\n  # Write.\r\n  df.write.text('gs://cnauroth-hive-metastore-proxy-dist/output/copy-shakespeare')\r\n\r\n  spark.stop()\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n  main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Chris Nauroth

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes adding the `DistributedSequenceID` message to support pandas API on Spark in Spark Connect. `DistributedSequenceID` create the distributed-sequence column which is used to generate [default index type](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.0/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type) for pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.connect.expressions import DistributedSequenceID\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.connect.column import Column\r\n>>> data = [(\"Alice\", 1), (\"Bob\", 2), (\"Charlie\", 3)]\r\n>>> sdf = spark.createDataFrame(data, [\"name\", \"age\"])\r\n>>> sdf.show()\r\n+-------+---+\r\n|   name|age|\r\n+-------+---+\r\n|  Alice|  1|\r\n|    Bob|  2|\r\n|Charlie|  3|\r\n+-------+---+\r\n\r\n>>> sdf.select(Column(DistributedSequenceID()).alias(\"sequence-index\"), \"*\").show()\r\n+--------------+-------+---+\r\n|sequence-index|   name|age|\r\n+--------------+-------+---+\r\n|             0|  Alice|  1|\r\n|             1|    Bob|  2|\r\n|             2|Charlie|  3|\r\n+--------------+-------+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark Connect cannot reuse the existing logic for pandas API on Spark, because the existing logic uses Py4J to utilize functions in the JVM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is an internal function.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe patch was tested by adding unit tests and manually verifying the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to Remove SparkSession constructor invocation in the example.\r\n\r\nWhile I am here, I piggyback and add an example of Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSparkSession's constructor is not meant to be exposed to the end users. This is also hidden in Scala side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it removes the usage of SparkSession constructor in the user facing docs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLinters should verify the changes in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the new golden file test framework for analysis for all input files.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n* In https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40449 we added the ability to exercise the analyzer on the SQL queries in existing golden files in the `sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/inputs` directory, writing separate output test files in the new `sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/analyzer-results` directory in additional to the original output directory for full end-to-end query execution results.\r\n* That PR also added an allowlist of input files to include in this new dual-run mode.\r\n* In this PR, we remove that allowlist exercise the new dual-run mode for all the input files. We also extend the analyzer testing to support separate test cases in ANSI-mode, TimestampNTZ, and UDFs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves test coverage and helps prevent against accidental regressions in the future as we edit the code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds testing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to replace `EquivalentExpressions` to a simple mutable map in `PhysicalAggregation`, the only place where `EquivalentExpressions.addExpr()` is used. `EquivalentExpressions` is useful for common subexpression elimination but in `PhysicalAggregation` it is used only to deduplicate whole expressions which can be easily done with a simple map.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`EquivalentExpressions.addExpr()` is not guarded by `supportedExpression()` and so it can cause inconsistent results when used together with `EquivalentExpressions.getExprState()`. This PR proposes replacing `.addExpr()` with other alternatives as its boolean result is a bit counter-intuitive to other collections' `.add()` methods. It returns `false` if the expression was missing and either adds the expression or not depending on if the expression is deterministic.\r\nAfter this PR we no longer use `EquivalentExpressions.addExpr()` so it can be deprecated or even removed...\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs from @rednaxelafx's PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40473. Please note that those UTs actually pass after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40475, but they are added here to make sure there will be no regression in the future.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-20T12:32:13Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T13:31:06Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T13:31:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0afbc840a9f264cefc7e0a7914373291a51feab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/345b9b59e44df0204ae551f3d9112ee2b830a826","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-42851-replace-equivalentexpressions-with-mutable-map","ref":"SPARK-42851-replace-equivalentexpressions-with-mutable-map","sha":"345b9b59e44df0204ae551f3d9112ee2b830a826","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe introduce the concept of a temporary VARIABLE. This is a typed and named scalar object that only exists within a session, much like a TEMPORARY VIEW and a TEMPORARY FUNCTION.\r\nThe purpose of the session variable is to carry intermediate data across multiple statements without bringing the data back into a notebook or a client and then back to the engine.\r\n\r\nVariables are living in the same namespace as columns. Being defined outside of any query, they are only resolved if a resolution to a column fails within the query (or update, delete, insert, merge).\r\n\r\nLike other session-level objects, there are no privileges associated.\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\nDECLARE [OR REPLACE] [VARIABLE] varName [ dataType] [DEFAULT | =] defaultExpr\r\n\r\nDROP TEMPORARY VARIABLE [IF EXISTS] varname\r\n\r\nSET {VARIABLE | VAR} { varName = expr } [, ...]\r\n\r\nSET {VARIABLE | VAR} ( varName [, ...] ) = ( query )\r\n\r\nvarname := [[`system` .] `session` .] identifier\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n-- Most fluffy form to create a variable\r\nDECLARE OR REPLACE VARIABLE var1 INT DEFAULT RAND(5) * 1000;\r\n\r\n-- Shortest form to create a variable\r\nDECLARE var1 = CURRENT_DATE();\r\n\r\nSET VAR var = 10;\r\n\r\n-- You can reset a variable to its default (which may be non-deterministic such as CURRENt_TIMESTAMP())\r\nSET VAR var = DEFAULT;\r\n\r\n-- Set multiple variable\r\nSET var1 = 6, var2 = (SELECT sum(c1) FROM t);\r\n\r\n-- Assign a single-row result of a query to set of variables\r\nSET VAR (var1, var2) = (SELECT sum(c1), max(c2) FROM t);\r\n\r\n-- Reference. variable in a query\r\nSELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c2 = var1;\r\n\r\n-- Disambiguate between a column and variable\r\nSELECT t.c1, session.c1 FROM T\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\n- Why don't we use SET?\r\n  Existing SET is so general (see SET .*? in the grammar) that it has proven (near) impossible to sort out configs, hivevars and variables)... In this PR we try to be nice by redirecting the user to use SET VARIABLE if they try to SET a variable.\r\n\r\n- Why SYSTEM.SESSION.varName?\r\n\r\nWe want to sort temporary objects into the multipart namespace and have started using SESSION in error messages as a search path.\r\nAlso long term, we want to support persisted variable definitions which will be multipart names.\r\n\r\n- Why not CREATE TEMPORARY VARIABLE?\r\nDECLARE is the generally accepted (and standardized in SQL/PSM) syntax to define local variables with SQL procedural logic. E.g. in anonymous blocks, procedures, and functions ([BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/procedural-language)).\r\nWhile we could use CREATE TEMPORARY as an alternative, it adds to the fluff. This is open for debate...\r\nWe want a short form, and a DECLARE <varname> fits the bill.  \r\n\r\nOpen issues (Todo):\r\n\r\n- Block SQL variables from DDL\r\n\r\nlike other temporary objects persisted objects such as VIEWS and DEFAULTs should not depend on them.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `EquivalentExpressions.addExpr()`, add a guard `supportedExpression()` to make it consistent with `addExprTree()` and `getExprState()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes a regression caused by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39010 which added the `supportedExpression()` to `addExprTree()` and `getExprState()` but not `addExpr()`.\r\n\r\nOne example of a use case affected by the inconsistency is the `PhysicalAggregation` pattern in physical planning. There, it calls `addExpr()` to deduplicate the aggregate expressions, and then calls `getExprState()` to deduplicate the result expressions. Guarding inconsistently will cause the aggregate and result expressions go out of sync, eventually resulting in query execution error (or whole-stage codegen error).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes a regression affecting Spark 3.3.2+, where it may manifest as an error running aggregate operators with higher-order functions.\r\n\r\nExample running the SQL command:\r\n```sql\r\nselect max(transform(array(id), x -> x)), max(transform(array(id), x -> x)) from range(2)\r\n```\r\nexample error message before the fix:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Couldn't find max(transform(array(id#0L), lambdafunction(lambda x#2L, lambda x#2L, false)))#4 in [max(transform(array(id#0L), lambdafunction(lambda x#1L, lambda x#1L, false)))#3]\r\n```\r\nafter the fix this error is gone.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nScheduler micro optimizations to speed up the scheduling loop.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe scheduler is single threaded and the faster we can schedule the faster a query executes. Changes to the scheduler usually adversely affect scheduling throughput which makes it hard to prototype novel changes. Getting some headroom makes experimentation faster while not hurting production.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances `CollapseRepartition` to remove repartition if it is the child of `LocalLimit`. Because its output is determined by the number of partitions and the expressions of the Repartition. Therefore, it is feasible to remove Repartition except for repartition by nondeterministic expressions, because users may expect to randomly take data.\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT /*+ REBALANCE */ * FROM t WHERE id > 1 LIMIT 5;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nGlobalLimit 5\r\n+- LocalLimit 5\r\n   +- RebalancePartitions\r\n      +- Filter (isnotnull(id#0L) AND (id#0L > 1))\r\n         +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t[id#0L] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nGlobalLimit 5\r\n+- LocalLimit 5\r\n   +- Filter (isnotnull(id#0L) AND (id#0L > 1))\r\n      +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t[id#0L] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we don't remove repartition if it looks like the user might want to take data randomly. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT /*+ REPARTITION(3) */ * FROM t WHERE id > 1 LIMIT 5;\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE id > 1 DISTRIBUTE BY random() LIMIT 5;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nReduce shuffle to improve query performance. The use case is that we add a repartition to improve the parallelism on a JDBC table:\r\n<img

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBe more explicit in the `Callable` type annotation for `dfapi` and `df_varargs_api` to explicitly return a `DataFrame`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn PySpark 3.3.x, type hints now infer the return value of something like `df.groupBy(...).count()` to be `Any`, whereas it should be `DataFrame`. This breaks type checking.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNo runtime changes introduced, so just relied on CI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull request proposes an improvement to the error message when trying to access a JVM attribute that is not supported in Spark Connect. Specifically, it adds a more informative error message that clearly indicates which attribute is not supported due to Spark Connect's lack of dependency on the JVM.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when attempting to access an unsupported JVM attribute in Spark Connect, the error message is not very clear, making it difficult for users to understand the root cause of the issue. This improvement aims to provide more helpful information to users to address this problem as below:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark._jsc\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nAttributeError: 'SparkSession' object has no attribute '_jsc'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark._jsc\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/haejoon.lee/Desktop/git_store/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/session.py\", line 490, in _jsc\r\n    raise PySparkAttributeError(\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkAttributeError: [JVM_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_SUPPORTED] Attribute `_jsc` is not supported in Spark Connect as it depends on the JVM. If you need to use this attribute, use the original PySpark instead of Spark Connect.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis PR does not introduce any user-facing change in terms of functionality. However, it improves the error message, which could potentially affect the user experience in a positive way.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested by adding new unit tests that specifically target the error message related to unsupported JVM attributes. The tests were run locally on a development environment.","created_at":"2023-03-16T15:13:44Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:49:23Z","closed_at":"2023-03-17T02:13:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12b3188d9b4bfc31919961236190d4183fc44061","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40458/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40458/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40458/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ad3e858cf9ec06124ea97bc3b28dda9a08e399e","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-42824","ref":"SPARK-42824","sha":"1ad3e858cf9ec06124ea97bc3b28dda9a08e399e","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `DataFrame.withSequenceColumn` to `DataFrame.select(distributed_sequence_column, col(\"*\")` internally because this essentially attaches a column and it should be treated as a scalar expression at the logical level.\r\n\r\nThis is used to generate the unique index only for pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better readability of codes, and for cleaner definition of Spark Connect protobuf message, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40270.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's internal change only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases in pandas API on Spark verify this change.","created_at":"2023-03-16T09:19:48Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:19Z","closed_at":"2023-03-20T12:16:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e275b95ee2536d7a9e7ad457bfd4664d07d694a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40456/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40456/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40456/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cc149aa4577f8cce89b539c27fd35887cce9a949","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-42720","ref":"SPARK-42720","sha":"cc149aa4577f8cce89b539c27fd35887cce9a949","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
