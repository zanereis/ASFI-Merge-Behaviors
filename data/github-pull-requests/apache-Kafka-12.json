test appears to be flaky because we mutated and reused the mocked log segments. Instead of using `thenReturn()`  and changing return value of an existing mock, or mutating the log segments within an existing mock return value, we can establish states we will need for the test and then conditionally return them using `thenAnswer()` to ensure consistent/reliable mock behavior.\r\n\r\nI ran the whole test class 100 times locally using below command and saw 100% success rate. (Had to remove `@Flaky` annotation locally and the import, assuming we don't want to remove the annotation in this PR until we see definitive proof this fixed the flakiness in healthy sample of subsequent builds.)\r\n\r\n`N=100; I=0; while [ $I -lt $N ]; do ./gradlew core:test --tests \"kafka.log.remote.RemoteLogManagerTest\" --rerun --fail-fast; (( I=$I+1 )); echo \"Completed run: $I\";

PR implements two changes in the KIP, and related logic on client & server side.\r\n\r\n - We replace topology ID with topology epoch. We only include the basic changes to the schema and basic validation for now (fail if topology is changed without a topology epoch bump) - since topology updating will follow later on.\r\n - We add status codes for topic validation, and implement the required logic to validate the internal topics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

possible that between evaluating\n`openIterators.isEmpty()` as `false` (because there's at least one open\nIterator) and evaluating `openIterators.first()`, that the last open\nIterator has been closed by a concurrent thread, causing\n`openIterators.first()` to throw a `NoSuchElementException`, which will\nbreak the Gauge and potentially the metrics reporting of

The best we can do is catch the `NoSuchElementException`\nand return a `null` instead.\n\nWe keep the `openIterators.isEmpty()` check to avoid throwing an\nexception in the common-case that there are

The result is that you end up with a server.properties that contains only the env vars.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if a user sets a custom empty config by mounting the wrong directory, the image silently runs the default configuration.

an issue with the TTD in the specific case where users don't specify an initial time for the driver and also don't specify a start timestamp for the TestInputTopic, then pipe input records without timestamps. This combination results in a slight mismatch in the expected timestamps for the piped records, which can be noticeable when writing tests with very small time deltas.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, while both the TTD and the TestInputTopic will be initialized to the \"current time\" when not otherwise specified, it's possible for some milliseconds to have passed between the creation of the TTD and the creation of the TestInputTopic. This can result in a TestInputTopic getting a start timestamp that's several ms larger than the driver's time, and ultimately causing the piped input records to have timestamps slightly in the future relative to the driver. \r\n\r\nIn practice even those who hit this issue might not notice it if they aren't manipulating time in their tests, or are advancing time by enough to negate the several-milliseconds of difference. However we noticed a test fail due to this because we were testing a ttl-based processor and had advanced the driver time by only 1 millisecond past the ttl. The piped record should have been expired, but because it's timestamp was a few milliseconds longer than the driver's start time, this test ended up failing.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-06T08:11:03Z","updated_at":"2024-11-09T03:04:07Z","closed_at":"2024-11-09T03:04:07Z","merged_at":"2024-11-09T03:04:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"32d9dec9e15c6e411f78ff5f4b60a14537f90d4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7559660738,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABwpdEwg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/small","name":"small","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"Small

change reduces fetch session cache evictions on the broker for `AsyncKafkaConsumer` by altering its logic to determine which partitions it includes in fetch requests.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n`Consumer` implementations fetch data from the cluster and temporarily buffer it in memory until the user next calls `Consumer.poll()`. When a fetch request is being generated, partitions that already have buffered data are not included in the fetch request.\r\n\r\nThe `ClassicKafkaConsumer` performs much of its fetch logic and network I/O in the application thread. On `poll()`, if there is any locally-buffered data, the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` does not fetch _any_ new data and simply returns the buffered data to the user from `poll()`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the `AsyncKafkaConsumer` consumer splits its logic and network I/O between two threads, which results in a potential race condition during fetch. The `AsyncKafkaConsumer` also checks for buffered data on its application thread. If it finds there is none, it signals the background thread to create a fetch request. However, it's possible for the background thread to receive data from a previous fetch and buffer it before the fetch request logic starts. When that occurs, as the background thread creates a new fetch request, it skips any buffered data, which has the unintended result that those partitions get added to the fetch request's \"to remove\" set. This signals to the broker to remove those partitions from its internal cache.\r\n\r\nThis issue is technically possible in the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` too, since the heartbeat thread performs network I/O in addition to the application thread. However, because of the frequency at which the `AsyncKafkaConsumer`'s background thread runs, it is ~100x more likely to happen.\r\n\r\n# Options\r\n\r\nThe core decision is: what should the background thread do if it is asked to create a fetch request and it discovers there's buffered data. There were multiple proposals to address this issue in the `AsyncKafkaConsumer`. Among them are:\r\n\r\n1. The background thread should omit buffered partitions from the fetch request as before (this is the existing behavior)\r\n2. The background thread should skip the fetch request generation entirely if there are *any* buffered partitions\r\n3. The background thread should include buffered partitions in the fetch request, but use a small “max bytes” value\r\n4. The background thread should skip fetching from the nodes that have buffered partitions\r\n\r\nOption 4 won out. The change is localized to `AbstractFetch` where the basic idea is to skip fetch requests to a given node if that node is the leader for buffered data. By preventing a fetch request from being sent to that node, it won't have any \"holes\" where the buffered partitions should be.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Eviction rate testing\r\n\r\nHere are the results of our internal stress testing:\r\n\r\n- `ClassicKafkaConsumer`—after the initial spike during test start up, the average rate settles down to ~0.14 evictions/second ![CLASSIC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b13c46a2-226f-44c9-a8c5-d6dc0d38d40e)\r\n- `AsyncKafkaConsumer`, (w/o fix)—after startup, the evictions still settle down, but they are about 100x higher than the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` at ~1.48 evictions/second ![CONSUMER-before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca5ff7f-74bd-4174-b6e6-39c4e8479684)\r\n- `AsyncKafkaConsumer` (w/ fix)—the eviction rate is now closer to the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` at ~0.22 evictions/second ![CONSUMER-after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19009791-d63e-411d-96ed-b49605f93325)\r\n\r\n## `EndToEndLatency` testing\r\n\r\nThe bundled `EndToEndLatency` test runner was executed on a single machine using Docker. The `apache/kafka:latest` Docker image was used and either the `cluster/combined/plaintext/docker-compose.yml` or `single-node/plaintext/docker-compose.yml` Docker Compose configuration files, depending on the test. The Docker containers were recreated from scratch before each test.\r\n\r\nA single topic was created with 30 partitions and with a replication factor of either 1 or 3, depending on a single- or multi-node setup.\r\n\r\nFor each of the test runs these argument values were used:\r\n\r\n- Message count: 100000\r\n- `acks`: 1\r\n- Message size: 128 bytes\r\n\r\nA configuration file which contained a single configuration value of `group.protocol=<$group_protocol>` was also provided to the test, where `$group_protocol` was either `CLASSIC` or `CONSUMER`.\r\n\r\n### Test results\r\n\r\n#### Test 1—`CLASSIC` group protocol, cluster size: 3 nodes, replication factor: 3\r\n\r\n| Metric            | `trunk` | PR     |\r\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| Average latency   |  1.4901 | 1.4871 |\r\n| 50th percentile   |       1 |      1 |\r\n| 99th percentile   |       3 |      3 |\r\n| 99.9th percentile |       6 |      6 | \r\n\r\n#### Test 2—`CONSUMER` group protocol, cluster size: 3 nodes, replication factor: 3\r\n\r\n| Metric            | `trunk` | PR     |\r\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| Average latency   |  1.4704 | 1.4807 |\r\n| 50th percentile   |       1 |      1 |\r\n| 99th percentile   |       3 |      3 |\r\n| 99.9th percentile |       6 |      7 | \r\n\r\n#### Test 3—`CLASSIC` group protocol, cluster size: 1 node, replication factor: 1\r\n\r\n| Metric            | `trunk` | PR     |\r\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| Average latency   |  1.0777 | 1.0193 |\r\n| 50th percentile   |       1 |      1 |\r\n| 99th percentile   |       2 |      2 |\r\n| 99.9th percentile |       5 |      4 | \r\n\r\n#### Test 4—`CONSUMER` group protocol, cluster size: 1 node, replication factor: 1\r\n\r\n| Metric            | `trunk` | PR     |\r\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| Average latency   |  1.0937 | 1.0503 |\r\n| 50th percentile   |       1 |      1 |\r\n| 99th percentile   |       2 |      2 |\r\n| 99.9th percentile |       4 |      4 | \r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThese tests did not reveal any significant differences between the current fetcher logic on `trunk` and the one proposed in this PR. Addition test runs using larger message counts and/or larger message sizes did not affect the result.","created_at":"2024-11-05T23:31:32Z","updated_at":"2025-01-31T22:27:39Z","closed_at":"2025-01-30T21:12:12Z","merged_at":"2025-01-30T21:12:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"6cf54c4dab9ff39f21d7f2c9bd241b938b5651b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

Streams actively purges records from repartition topics.  Prior to this PR, Kafka Streams would retrieve the offset from the `consumedOffsets` map, but here are a couple of edge cases where the `consumedOffsets` can get ahead of the `commitedOffsets` map.  In these cases, this means Kafka Streams will potentially purge a repartition record before it's committed.\r\n\r\nUpdated the current `StreamTask` test to cover this case\r\n\r\n### Committer

change is aimed at improving test logging and aiding in debugging a flaky test.\r\n\r\nI noticed that `testElectPreferredLeaders()` has been flaky or has failed recently, [Develocity](https://ge.apache.org/scans/tests?search.names=CI%20workflow,Git%20repository&search.relativeStartTime=P90D&search.rootProjectNames=kafka&search.tags=github,trunk&search.tasks=test&search.timeZoneId=America%2FLos_Angeles&search.values=CI,https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fapache%2Fkafka&tests.container=kafka.api.PlaintextAdminIntegrationTest&tests.test=testElectPreferredLeaders(String)%5B1%5D). \r\n\r\nPreviously, the test made calls to the `preferredLeader()` method within both the lambda and the error message in the `TestUtils.waitUntilTrue` block. These repeated calls could potentially be misleading (or even inaccurate) when diagnosing test failures, as they might reflect different leader states.\r\n\r\nThis update simplifies the test by storing the result of `preferredLeader()` in temporary variables, which are then consistently used in both the lambda and error message. This should make the test output clearer and more reliable for debugging.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-03T21:55:47Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T03:37:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11772491ff10e4403c0f47f01b12325cb3be821a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

Added a test to demonstrate the impact of pressure on remote storage by consumers using READ_COMMITTED isolation level which reads the index files repeatedly. \r\n- Configured the remote-log index cache size to 1 to simulate eviction of cached index entries.\r\n- In integration tests, we asserted the number of remote calls made to fetch the segment. Extended the logic to assert the number of remote calls made to download the offset-index, time-index, and transaction-index auxiliary files to serve the FETCH request. Verified the number of fetch requests from tiered storage matches the expected value.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

PR is a solution for [KAFKA-17635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17635).  I went with the approach here, as I feel we should always be confirming offsets have been committed before purging them, instead of relying on the convention that the commit has successfully occurred.\r\n\r\nAlthough this occurred in 3.7.1 this situation exists in trunk.  The plan is to merge to trunk then cherry-pick this back to 3.9, 3.8, and 3.7\r\n\r\nFor testing the `StreamsTaskTest` has been updated to confirm when calling for purgeable offsets only offsets confirmed committed are returned.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-01T18:19:27Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T19:32:03Z","closed_at":"2024-11-01T19:32:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3825d6d27a7c8ddc443899ac1d2330887721129e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7559660738,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABwpdEwg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/small","name":"small","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"Small

Currently, we are using the String repr of the shareCoordinator/sharePartition key `(groupId:topicId:parition)` as defined in [kip-932](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-932%3A+Queues+for+Kafka#KIP932:QueuesforKafka-Thesharecoordinatorandtheshare-groupstatetopic) in a few methods like `ShareCoordinator.partitionFor` and `ShareCoordinatorMetadataCacheHelper.getShareCoordinator`.\r\n* This has the potential to introduce subtle bugs when incorrect strings are used to invoke these methods. What is perturbing is that the failures might be intermittent.\r\n* This PR aims to remedy the situation by changing the type to the concrete `SharePartitionKey`. This way callers need not be worried about a specific encoding or format of the coordinator key as long as the `SharePartitionKey` has the correct fields set.\r\n* There is one issue - the FIND_COORDINATOR RPC does require the coordinator key to be set as a String in the request body. We can't get around this and have to set the value as String. However, on the KafkaApis handler side we parse this key into a `SharePartitionKey` again and gain compile time safety. One downside is that we need to split and format the incoming coordinator key in the request but that can be encapsulated at a single location in `SharePartitionKey`.\r\n* Added tests for `partitionFor`.","created_at":"2024-11-01T14:53:18Z","updated_at":"2024-11-08T09:35:39Z","closed_at":"2024-11-08T09:35:39Z","merged_at":"2024-11-08T09:35:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e2b0a58eda3e677763af974a44a6aaa3c280214","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

recent test failure documented by https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17649 seems to be related to the string representation of SharePartitionKey. This is a combination of group-id:topic-id:partition used by share groups to refer to a \"share-partition\" which is a particular share group's view of a topic-partition. The SharePartitionKey is used to find the share coordinator responsible for a share-partition.\r\n\r\nIt looks like some code was using a simple concatenation of the fields, while others was using toString which is human-readable. This mismatch seems to have caused requests to be sent to the wrong share coordinator, resulting in tests timing out.\r\n\r\nThis PR aligns all lookup-based uses of SharePartitionKey on the simple concatenation of its constituent parts.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-31T17:19:55Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T14:01:25Z","closed_at":"2024-11-01T07:43:33Z","merged_at":"2024-11-01T07:43:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"346fdbafc539bc48bb66eedae89a15e240007fd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6979675393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABoAVlAQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-932","name":"KIP-932","color":"DA462F","default":false,"description":"Queues
