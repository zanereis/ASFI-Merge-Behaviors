change re-enables search in notes for the DagRun and TaskInstance views (under the Browse dropdown menu). \r\n\r\nTurns out *desc.value_attr* is the column name in the remote table. This means that this only worked if the attribute with the association proxy had the same name as the associated column, otherwise the wrong column name was used as the key (e.g. content instead of note). The only instance this caused an issue was for the notes, the names were matching in all other cases that are shown in the UI. \r\n\r\nI took the liberty to fix the note search for the TaskInstance view as well, at the expense of disabling ordering by note. Unfortunately sorting by an association proxy isn't supported, and mixing it with the actual field reference (table_name.column_name format) didn't solve the issue either.\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses: #30042

used to have low number of Public runners on GitHub actions and Apache Software Foundation projects were competing for them, that's why we switched `build-images` workflow to run on self-hosted runners, and we had to add workflow-embedded list of committers to make sure that build-info also uses self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\nRecently however the ASF has 900 runners and if anything, it's the public runners that are in abundance, while self-hosted runners are limited, which sometimes leads to \"Wait for CI images\" jobs timeout while waiting for self-hosted runners to build the image.\r\n\r\nThose \"wait-for-ci-images\" jobs do almost nothing, just waiting, so using self-hosted runners for those is not needed, we can easily switch those to public runners as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following changes:\r\n\r\n* build-info jobs always run on public runners\r\n* wait-for-ci-images job are always run on public runners\r\n* all the other jobs run on either self-hosted or public runners depending who the actor is (committers - run on self-hosted, non-committers, run on public runners)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#31440\r\nrelated: #31301 #31399\r\n\r\nThis PR adds three new (small) features into the Trigger DAG UI form for increased usability and new (missing) features:\r\n* In select lists (rendered via `enum`) display labels can be added to separate picked value and display text in dropdown via `values_display` property.\r\n* If user should have proposals for entering values but should not be forced to the limited number of `enum`s now the attribute `examples`can be used which are used to present proposals while typing\r\n* Multi-value selects are now possible (So that not only `enum`s with single values need to be used).

you run the dev mode for Breeze start-airlfow the webpack to compile the assets is run in the background and should be stopped as soon as the main process leaves. This has been done via daemon Thread, however it turns out that when daemon thread gets stopped at exit, it is stopped pretty abruptly. Quoting\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html ::\r\n\r\n> Note Daemon threads are abruptly stopped at shutdown. Their resources\r\n(such as open files, database transactions, etc.) may not be released properly. If you want your threads to stop gracefully, make them non-daemonic and use a suitable signalling mechanism such as an Event.\r\n\r\nThis also means that if the daemon threds starts a subprocess, the thread is killed but the subprocess is not - the subprocess gets orphaned and gets adopted by init process and continues running.\r\n\r\nTis PR replaces the mechanism with forking. Instead of running thread, it will fork a new process that will run the compilation (including starting the subprocess that runs it). It will also change group for the started forked process to be the same as the new pid, which creates a new process group and register an atexit method to send TERM to all the processes belonging to that grop, so even if the node process that runs compilation does not propagate the TERM signal (it does not) to the webpack processes, all the webpack processes share the same process group and get the SIGTERM signal.\r\n\r\nFixes: #31384\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

When a module (or package) includes a version number, the version SHOULD be available in the `__version__` attribute\r\n> 4. For modules which live inside a namespace package, the module SHOULD include the `__version__` attribute. The namespace package itself SHOULD NOT include its own `__version__` attribute.\r\n\r\n(The namespace package is `airflow.providers` in our case, so all good.)\r\n\r\nTIL there is a pep for this, even if it's now rejected the above bits are still a useful indicator of what is common\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

have existed for a while, but only visible now. Maybe other dependencies were holding jupyter-client back and only released it to upgrade to a version that emits this message?\r\n\r\nI also find it awkward that jupyter just starts emitting this without actually releasing a jupyter-core version that can naturally silence the mssage. This means that downstreams have no chance but to ignore the warning since there’s literally nothing to actually address the warning. This is not how I would handle this migration.

#31299 \r\n\r\nThis PR relaxes the DAG validation at parse time for JSON Param validation for DAGs which are triggered manual. For a manual triggered DAG the `params` are validated at time of trigger.\r\nThis makes the current `DAG` class constructor/`__init__()` validation consistent with the DAG parsing validation. which allows:\r\n\r\n- Define required `params` for manually triggered DAGs w/o default values - to enforce users to really provide a value (w/o just hitting \"Trigger\" button and run a flow by accident with a bad default)\r\n- Preventing to Trigger a DAG w/o using the form or valid parameters\r\n\r\nEffects of change of this PR:\r\n- All `params`validations for scheduled DAGs keep the same as valid `params` are needed for automated scheduling\r\n   - Note this is actually a one-liner in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31301/files#diff-62c8e300ee91e0d59f81e0ea5d30834f04db71ae74f2e155a10b51056b00b59bR716\r\n- The Tutorial is adjusted - and can only be triggered via Form as a default value is missing\r\n- Documentation is adjusted in this regards\r\n\r\nHow to test?\r\n- The `example_params_ui_tutorial` is also possible to be parsed w/o required field defaults (See bug report)\r\n- Try to trigger the `example_params_ui_tutorial` DAG manual w/o filling required field, validation in form will block you\r\n- Try to trigger the `example_params_ui_tutorial` DAG via CLI: `airflow dags trigger example_params_ui_tutorial` - should also block you with missing parameter (unless you add the missing param in the CLI call).\r\n- Enter some data into form and the required field and see it runs happily\r\n\r\nNote: Some fixes which originally were contained in the PR are carved out and have been merged to main already. The \"new\" and current version of this PR is now based on the PR
