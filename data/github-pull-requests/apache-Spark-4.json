However, it almost doubled the TPCDS 1g CI runtime by adding 44 minutes.\r\n- #45739\r\n\r\nThe root cause is a slowness on `q22-v2.7`. Given that the whole `TPCDSQueryTestSuite` took 6min, 16min, and 17min respectively per conbination, a single query runtime of `q22-v2.7` is relatively too long (14 minutes). Since we know that the collation slowness is not specific this query, we had better skip this test case until we resolve the performance perspective.\r\n<img width=\"735\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-17 at 11 56 33\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d90fcd5c-d2c5-4f78-b711-830b6df5b628\" />\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] *** Test still running after 2 minutes, 31 seconds: suite name: TPCDSCollationQueryTestSuite, test name: q22-v2.7. \r\n[info] *** Test still running after 7 minutes, 31 seconds: suite name: TPCDSCollationQueryTestSuite, test name: q22-v2.7. \r\n[info] *** Test still running after 12 minutes, 31 seconds: suite name: TPCDSCollationQueryTestSuite, test name: q22-v2.7. \r\n[info] - q22-v2.7 (14 minutes, 18 seconds)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new `visitBinaryComparison` method to `V2ExpressionSQLBuilder`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe origin `visitBinaryComparison` method is not good for users when the compare predicate is related to the data type.\r\nSuch as: Oracle doesn't support predicate '=' for binary and need use `DBMS_LOB.COMPARE` to replace.\r\nSo the old `visitBinaryComparison` method is not flexible and introduce some hacker code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust add a new API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-17T13:46:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:39:38Z","closed_at":"2025-01-21T09:40:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e41ac751a71fe0971d7eacc19044e8d8ac1b192e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2441ca0ccbd9427505c2555caa672c26b077e019","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-50880","ref":"SPARK-50880","sha":"2441ca0ccbd9427505c2555caa672c26b077e019","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd the timezone information to a cast expression when the destination type requires it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen current_timestamp() is materialized as a string, the timezone information is gone (e.g., 2024-12-27 10:26:27.684158) which prohibits further optimization rules from being applied to the affected data source.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject [1735900357973433#10 AS current_timestamp()#6]\r\n+- 'Project [cast(2025-01-03 10:32:37.973433#11 as timestamp) AS 1735900357973433#10]\r\n   +- RelationV2[2025-01-03 10:32:37.973433#11] xxx\r\n```\r\n\r\n-> This query fails to execute because the injected cast expression lacks the timezone information.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new configuration `spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.hideTraceback.enabled`. If set, when handling an exception from Python UDF, only the exception class and message are included. The configuration is turned off by default.\r\nThis PR also adds a new optional parameter `hide_traceback` for `handle_udf_exception` to override the configuration.\r\n\r\nSuggested review order:\r\n1. `python/pyspark/util.py`: logic changes\r\n2. `python/pyspark/tests/test_util.py`: unit tests\r\n3. other files: adding new configuration\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis allows library provided UDFs to show only the relevant message without unnecessary stack trace.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf the configuration is turned off, no user change.\r\nOtherwise, the stack trace is not included in the error message when handling an exception from Python UDF.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Example that illustrates the difference</summary>\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pyspark.errors.exceptions.base import PySparkRuntimeError\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, StructField, StructType\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.udtf import AnalyzeArgument, AnalyzeResult\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udtf\r\n\r\n\r\n@udtf()\r\nclass PythonUDTF:\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(x: AnalyzeArgument) -> AnalyzeResult:\r\n        raise PySparkRuntimeError(\"[XXX] My PySpark runtime error.\")\r\n\r\n    def eval(self, x: int):\r\n        yield (x,)\r\n\r\n\r\nspark.udtf.register(\"my_udtf\", PythonUDTF)\r\nspark.sql(\"select * from my_udtf(1)\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith configuration turned off, the last line gives:\r\n```\r\n...\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.captured.AnalysisException: [TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION_FAILED_TO_ANALYZE_IN_PYTHON] Failed to analyze the Python user defined table function: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 7, in analyze\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkRuntimeError: [XXX] My PySpark runtime error.

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, there are two implementations of DownloadFileWritableChannel (which is used for writing data fetched to disk), SimpleDownloadWritableChannel and EncryptedDownloadWritableChannel. The latter closes the writable channel in it's implementation of closeAndRead method while the former does not. As a result, SimpleDownloadWritableChannel channel is never closed and is relying on either the finalizer in FileOutputStream or the phantom cleanable in FileDescriptor to close the file descriptor. The change in this PR is to close the channel in SimpleDownloadWritableChannel closeAndRead method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nShould be closing file handles when they are not needed anymore instead of relying on finalizer/cleanables to do it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting spark tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExpress ML params with `proto.Expression.Literal`：\r\n1, introduce `Literal.SpecializedArray` for large primitive literal arrays (e.g. the initial model coefficients which can be large)\r\n```\r\n    message SpecializedArray {\r\n      oneof value_type {\r\n        Bools bools = 1;\r\n        Ints ints = 2;\r\n        Longs longs = 3;\r\n        Floats floats = 4;\r\n        Doubles doubles = 5;\r\n        Strings strings = 6;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      message Bools {\r\n        repeated bool values = 1;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      message Ints {\r\n        repeated int32 values = 1;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      message Longs {\r\n        repeated int64 values = 1;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      message Floats {\r\n        repeated float values = 1;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      message Doubles {\r\n        repeated double values = 1;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      message Strings {\r\n        repeated string values = 1;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n2, Replace `proto.Param ` with `proto.Expression` to be consistent with SQL side\r\nFor `Param[Vector]` and `Param[Matrix]`, apply `proto.Expression.Literal.Struct` with the underlying schema of `VectorUDT` and `MatrixUDT`.\r\n\r\nE.g. for `Param[Vector]` with value `Vectors.sparse(4, [(1, 1.0), (3, 5.5)])`, the message is like:\r\n```\r\nliteral {\r\nstruct {\r\n  struct_type {\r\n    struct {\r\n      ... <- schema of VectorUDT\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  elements {\r\n    byte: 0\r\n  }\r\n  elements {\r\n    integer: 4\r\n  }\r\n  elements {\r\n    specialized_array {\r\n      ints {\r\n        values: 1\r\n        values: 3\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  elements {\r\n    specialized_array {\r\n      doubles {\r\n        values: 1\r\n        values: 5.5\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, to optimize large literal arrays, for both ML and SQL (we can apply it in SQL side later)\r\n2, be consistent with SQL side, e.g. the parameterized SQL\r\n```\r\n  // (Optional) A map of parameter names to expressions.\r\n  // It cannot coexist with `pos_arguments`.\r\n  map<string, Expression.Literal> named_arguments = 4;\r\n\r\n  // (Optional) A sequence of expressions for positional parameters in the SQL query text.\r\n  // It cannot coexist with `named_arguments`.\r\n  repeated Expression pos_arguments = 5;\r\n```\r\n3, to minimize the protobuf change\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno, refactor-only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up on #16685 and #16692.\r\n\r\nImplements upsert mode for `SaveMode.Append` of the MySql, MsSql, and Postgres JDBC source.\r\n\r\nSee #41611 for an alternative using the `MERGE INTO` command (not supported by MySql).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe JDBC writer only supports either truncating the existing table or inserting. Duplicates, i.e. rows with identical values in the primary or unique index columns, cause an exception, permitting updating existing and inserting new rows.\r\n\r\nRe-evaluating a partition due to executor loss will insert rows that have been inserted in an earlier attempt, which kills the entier Spark job.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis adds `upsert` and

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe conversion of Hive's timestamp to Catalyst TimestampType needs handling, as during hive table metadata reload, the Hive's timestamp gets incorrectly mapped to spark's TimestampNTZType, if the timestamp alias is set to TimestampNTZType via the conf property spark.sql.timestampType.\r\nThe fix is written keeping in mind, that in future when spark's timestamp are mapped correctly with Hive's timestamp, then table reload should not result in incorrect TimestampType in spark.\r\nThe changes are that while mapping hive timestamp field to spark's StructField, the actual hive's datatype is stored in the metadata of the struct field.\r\nThis allows to rectify the table schema by changing the Spark's TimestampNTZType back to TimestampType if the original hive datatype is \"timestamp\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAny table operation which requires reload of table metadata would fail, as Hive does not understand spark's TimeStampNTZType.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded bug test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now, if `to_protobuf()` is called with an argument that is not StructType, `\r\nscala.MatchError` is thrown. We should categorize this error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`scala.MatchError` is confusing to users and doesn't include enough information for debugging.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a new unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPerforms additional checks inside recursive CTEs to throw an error if forbidden case is encountered:\r\n1. Recursive term can contain one recursive reference only.\r\n2. Recursive reference can't be used in some kinds of joins and aggregations.\r\n3. Recursive references are not allowed in subqueries\r\n\r\nIn addition, the name of `recursive` function inside `CTERelationDef` is rewritten to `hasRecursiveCTERelationRef` and adds `hasItsOwnUnionLoopRef` function as it is also needed to check if cteDef is recursive after substitution.\r\n\r\nA small bug in `CTESubstitution` is fixed which now enables substitution of self-references within subqueries as well (but not its resolution, as they are not allowed).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSupport for the recursive CTE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nwill be tested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49571\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen storing table metadata in the `describe` LinkedHashMap object, we retain the timestamp as a `long`data type (instead of converting to a formatted date `string` type) to allow flexibility and extensibility of `describe` date format. Formatting the date fields is delegated to the caller (e.g. describe table, describe as json, describe column, etc.). \r\n\r\nExample date for describe table: `Mon Nov 01 12:00:00 UTC 2021`\r\n\r\nExample date for describe as json: `2021-11-01T12:00:00Z`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImprove extensibility of `describe` and ensure backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAffects the `describe` output date format\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded `describe table` tests for date format\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRight now fixed-point resolved plan is return as a result of analysis of the unresolved plan. In this task we add a flag in order to guard returning of the single-pass result in specific cases so it can be reverted more easily + return single-pass resolver result as the result of the dual-run analysis.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nGoal is to have single-pass resolver result as the global one (analysis result of an unresolved plan). We are introducing it now but also adding a flag so it can be reverted easily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests with the `ANALYZER_DUAL_RUN_LEGACY_AND_SINGLE_PASS_RESOLVER` value set to true.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces connect ML with a plugin that could replace operators of spark.ml with third-party implementations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe connect ML is using spark.ml as the backend implementations, which is not GPU-accelerated. This PR could allow the\r\nthird-party library as the connect ML backend to accelerate the ML cases with GPUs without changing any users code. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it's a new feature. This PR defines a spark configuration `spark.connect.ml.backend.classes` to specify the plugin which\r\nmust implement `org.apache.spark.sql.connect.plugin.MLBackendPlugin`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMake sure the CI (the newly added tests which have covered the plugin cases) pass. And manually run below code without any exception.\r\n\r\n1. Build your own plugin package\r\n\r\n\r\n- Customize the estimator\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\npackage com.example.ml\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.classification.{LogisticRegression => SparkLR, LogisticRegressionModel => SparkLRModel}\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.util.Identifiable\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset\r\n\r\nclass LogisticRegression(override val uid: String) extends SparkLR {\r\n\r\n  private val logger = LogFactory.getLog(\"com.example.ml.LogisticRegression\")\r\n\r\n  def this() = this(Identifiable.randomUID(\"logreg\"))\r\n\r\n  override def train(dataset: Dataset[_]): SparkLRModel = {\r\n    logger.info(\"Bobby train in SparkRapidsML library.\")\r\n    super.train(dataset)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand create `org.apache.spark.ml.Estimator` file under the `META-INF/services` and register the customized LogisticRegression\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.example.ml.LogisticRegression\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Implement the MLBackendPlugin\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\npackage com.example.ml\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.connect.plugin.MLBackendPlugin\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Optional\r\n\r\nclass Plugin extends MLBackendPlugin {\r\n\r\n  override def transform(mlName: String): Optional[String] = {\r\n    mlName match {\r\n      case \"org.apache.spark.ml.classification.LogisticRegression\" =>\r\n        Optional.of(\"com.example.ml.LogisticRegression\")\r\n      case _ => Optional.empty()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Compile\r\n\r\nAfter compilation, we can get a similiar com.example.ml-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n\r\n2. Run the python tests\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.classification import (LogisticRegression,\r\n                                       LogisticRegressionModel)\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.linalg import

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new mutable state `taskInterrupted` in `InputRDDCodegen`. The state indicates whether the task thread is interrupted or not. `InputRDDCodegen` would check the state each time when it produces a record and stops immediately if `taskInterrupted=true`. `taskInterrupted` would be updated by `TaskContext.isInterrupted()` per 1000 output rows processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis facilitates the resource release when there is a task killing request.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid importing optional Python packages for checking, by using `importlib.util.find_spec` instead of actually loading/importing the package.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/a40919912f5ce7f63fff2907b30e473dd4155227 changed to import optional dependencies in main code. After that, technically https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/f223b8da9e23e4e028e145e0d4dd74eeae5d2d52 broke the Python Spark Core tests, (because now we will import `pyspark.testing`, and it will import optional dependencies) but it did not run the tests.\r\n\r\nBy importing `deepspeed`, via logger, it can show stdout (https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/accelerator/real_accelerator.py#L182). This broke the test in `pyspark.conf`. After that, the real test failure was found when core change was triggered at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/6f3b778e1a12901726c2a35072904f36f46f7888. In the PR, build passed because it was before https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/f223b8da9e23e4e028e145e0d4dd74eeae5d2d52 was merged.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTechnically yes. There might be some side effects by importing optional dependencies, and this PR avoid them.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should verify it.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Previously, connectors could project metadata columns in a row-level operation, but the metadata values were always preserved and could not be nullified. After this change, connectors control which metadata columns preserved and when.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior is implemented via flags in `metadataInJSON` exposed for `MetadataAttribute`. This PR also extends the existing `DataWriter` and `DeltaWriter` interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are essential to support row lineage in Iceberg and Delta Lake. Both projects define a row ID and a row version as part of their metadata concepts. The row ID is a synthetic metadata column that is null when a record is first inserted and becomes assigned through inheritance. Once assigned, the row ID must remain constant and unaltered. In contrast, the row version is updated with every modification and must be re-assigned. The existing implementation of DELETE, UPDATE, and MERGE operations in Spark doesn't support conditional metadata column nullification required to support row lineage.\r\n\r\nSuppose there is a table containing the following rows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n dep |   name    | salary | _row_lineage_id | _row_lineage_version |     _file      | _pos\r\n-----+-----------+--------+-----------------+----------------------+----------------+------\r\n hr  | Alice     |  200   | 101             | v1                   | fileA.parquet  | 0\r\n hr  | Robert    |  240   | 102             | v1                   | fileA.parquet  | 1\r\n it  | Charlie   |  260   | 103             | v1                   | fileA.parquet  | 2\r\n it  | Bob       |  220   | 104             | v1                   | fileA.parquet  | 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `UPDATE t SET salary = salary + 10 WHERE dep = 'hr'` should produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n operation | row_id (_file, _pos)        | row (dep, name, salary)  | metadata (_row_lineage_id, _row_lineage_version)\r\n-----------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------\r\n update    | (fileA.parquet, 0)          | (hr, Alice, 210)         | (101, null)\r\n update    | (fileA.parquet, 1)          | (hr, Robert, 250)        | (102, null)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `_row_lineage_id` values are preserved but `_row_lineage_version` are nullified.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, but the changes are backward compatible due to default values for added flags.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add a case to handle None in `VariantType.toInternal`. Also, variants can be used with `createDataFrame` when using Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, `spark.createDataFrame([(VariantVal(bytearray([12, 1]), bytearray([1, 0, 0])),), (None,)], \"v variant\").show()` failed because there was no way of handling nulls.\r\n\r\nAlso, `createDataFrame` did not work with Variants prior to this PR - now it does.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it fixes a bug where `None` values couldn't be handled with Variant schemas, and allows users to use createDataFrame with Variants in the Python client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemove standalone SQL error pages that were made obsolete by the work completed in #44971.\r\n\r\nAlso fix the formatting of the error message for `QUERY_ONLY_CORRUPT_RECORD_COLUMN`, since it was incorrect and overflowing the table cell it belongs to.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese error pages are either already captured completely in `common/utils/src/main/resources/error/error-conditions.json`, or are obsolete and not needed (and are not being rendered in the documentation output anyway).\r\n\r\nThe formatting of `QUERY_ONLY_CORRUPT_RECORD_COLUMN` before and after:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/476c57e0-dfa5-403e-8a7d-2d05301eb7a3\" width=650 />\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTurn on Arrow optimization for Python UDFs by default\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nArrow optimization was introduced in 3.4.0. See [SPARK-40307](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40307) for more context.\r\n\r\nArrow-optimized Python UDF is approximately 1.6 times faster than the original pickled Python UDF. More details can be found in [this blog post](https://www.databricks.com/blog/arrow-optimized-python-udfs-apache-sparktm-35).\r\n\r\nIn version 4.0.0, we propose enabling the optimization by default. If PyArrow is not installed, it will fall back to the original pickled Python UDF.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-14T08:55:42Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:34:03Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e0a5b9dcac56f9b50a6e15071d6715ecf2c1f1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06d7d83e6943a499e804beaed2476a9d2bc746b1","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:arrow_on","ref":"arrow_on","sha":"06d7d83e6943a499e804beaed2476a9d2bc746b1","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe statement `(CAST(`hgssiteid` AS LONGTEXT) = '101772291401')` is not work in the jdbc MYSQL/TIDB\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/cast-functions.html\r\nProduces a string with the VARCHAR data type, unless the expression expr is empty (zero length), in which case the result type is CHAR(0). If the optional length N is given, CHAR(N) causes the cast to use no more than N characters of the argument. No padding occurs for values shorter than N characters. If the optional length N is not given, MySQL calculates the maximum length from the expression. If the supplied or calculated length is greater than an internal threshold, the result type is TEXT. If the length is still too long, the result type is LONGTEXT.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove `PlanLogger.logPlanResolution` so it shows just unresolved and resolved plans.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `PlanLogger` dumps `unresolvedPlan.withNewChildren(resolvedPlan.children` and `resolvedPlan` in `logPlanResolution` method. This leads to internal errors because in `withNewChildren` we have `children.size == newChildren.size` check which can fail sometimes (e.g when `UnresolvedRelation` is substituted with `SubqueryAlias(..., child, ...)`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests with the `ANALYZER_DUAL_RUN_LEGACY_AND_SINGLE_PASS_RESOLVER` value set to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

But according to the parameter description, the krb5.conf file should be mounted on both the driver and the executor.\r\n```\r\n  val KUBERNETES_KERBEROS_KRB5_FILE =\r\n    ConfigBuilder(\"spark.kubernetes.kerberos.krb5.path\")\r\n      .doc(\"Specify the local location of the krb5.conf file to be mounted on the driver \" +\r\n        \"and executors for Kerberos. Note: The KDC defined needs to be \" +\r\n        \"visible from inside the containers \")\r\n      .version(\"3.0.0\")\r\n      .stringConf\r\n      .createOptional\r\n\r\n  val KUBERNETES_KERBEROS_KRB5_CONFIG_MAP =\r\n    ConfigBuilder(\"spark.kubernetes.kerberos.krb5.configMapName\")\r\n      .doc(\"Specify the name of the ConfigMap, containing the krb5.conf file, to be mounted \" +\r\n        \"on the driver and executors for Kerberos. Note: The KDC defined\" +\r\n        \"needs to be visible from inside the containers \")\r\n      .version(\"3.0.0\")\r\n      .stringConf\r\n      .createOptional\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter [SPARK-43504](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43504), the hadoop config map will be mounted on the executor pod.\r\nNow the executor pod fails to start because the hadoop conf file contains Kerberos authentication configuration, but the executor does not mount krb5.conf correctly.\r\nSee the https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41181 discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users do not need to take workarounds to make executors load the krb5.conf.\r\nSuch as:\r\n\r\n- including krb5.conf in executor image\r\n- placing krb5.conf in executor working directory using --files\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- UT.\r\n- Manually test\r\n  1. After compiling the code successfully, I rebuilt the Spark image (the image does not contain the /etc/krb5.conf file) and used the new client to submit.\r\n  2. Prior to this PR, the executor pod fails to start, logs showed an error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Can't get Kerberos realm. Because krb5.conf was not mounted to the executor pod correctly.\r\n  3. After this PR, the executor pod starts successfully, and the executor pod logs show Kerberos authentication, with the same krb5.conf config map mounted as the driver pod.\r\n<img width=\"1445\"
