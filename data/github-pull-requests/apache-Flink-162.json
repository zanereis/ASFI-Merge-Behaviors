To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request correct the word used in the javaDocs in class MemoryStateBackend...*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - *Correct phrase 'rather then' with 'rather than' in javaDocs in class MemoryStateBackend*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the bug when deploying on yarn in attach mode that flink client hangs after `Ctrl + C`. More information could be found at [FLINK-10435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10435).\r\n\r\nThis PR is for release-1.9 branch. It has the same logic with #10010 . \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* remove the `yarnClient.close()` in `failSessionDuringDeployment` and use a new yarn client in `DeploymentFailureHook`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n* Manually run a command to start flink cluster on yarn in attach mode. `./bin/flink run -m yarn-cluster examples/streaming/WindowJoin.jar`\r\n* When the application is in ACCEPTED status, send the `Ctrl + C`.\r\n* The flink client exits immediately.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nOrcColumnarRowReader is introduced to read orc data in batches.\r\n\r\nWhen returning each row of data, instead of actually retrieving each field, we use BaseRow's abstraction to return a Columnar Row-like view.\r\n\r\nThis will greatly improve the downstream filtered scenarios, so that there is no need to access redundant fields on the filtered data.\r\n\r\nAnd read binary string instead of string can greatly reduce the cost of encode and decode.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1.Refactor orc input format to reuse codes\r\n2.Introduce OrcVectors\r\n3.Introduce OrcColumnarRowReader\r\n4.Refactor hive input format to abstract reader\r\n5.Integrate OrcColumnarRowReader to hive.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThere are two existing methods in StreamingFileSink:\r\nwithRollingPolicy and withBucketAssigner which can be used separately. Also there is method withNewBucketAssignerAndPolicy which can be used as replacement for two mentioned methods. \r\nIt seems that this method should be named as withNewBucketAssignerAndRollingPolicy.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nRename method withNewBucketAssignerAndPolicy to withNewBucketAssignerAnd**Rolling**Policy\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes (?)\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos,

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSome metric sources (e.g. Kafka) expose metrics with infinity values, which causes for each reporting period:\r\n* errors logged on InfluxDB side\r\n* warnings logged in Flink\r\n\r\nMoreover logs can't be pushed via Telegraf because Telegraf parser rejects writes that contain invalid data.\r\n\r\nUpgraded dependency filters out unsupported field values.\r\n\r\nReplaces #8513.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpgrade influxdb-java dependency (2.14 -> 2.16).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change upgrades a dependency and is covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix the issues when the operator is chained with other operators. Currently when create operator chain, the colocation group configuration is not considered, and for a tree of chained operators, the colocation group configured with the root operator is always used. Therefore, if an operator except for the root one has configured with the colocation group, it will always be ignored, this will cause some colocation configuration does not take effect. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - 3f6588fd45ff1fd13c9798974c8d34d143215da0 has changed the logic to test whether an operator can be chained with its precedent to consider the colocation configuration. The operator can only be chained if it's colocation configuration does not conflict with the other operators in chain. Besides, the colocation group is always set to the right one of each chain for the resulting job vertex.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added tests to ensure the colocation group is set correctly for each scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  -

using concat or concat_ws in some cases\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently unique key metadata of a project relnode are only kept in the following three situations:\r\n\r\n- project the child unique keys while not changing them\r\n- cast the child unique key when ignoring nulls and the original type of the field and cast type are the same\r\n- rename the child unique keys\r\n\r\nBesides these situations, concat and concat_ws should also keep the metadata if they won't break the uniqueness of the child unique keys, i.e. each operands is in one of the above situations, and the operands include all the child unique keys.\r\n\r\nSay the f0 and f1 are the unique key fields of the child node, the following sqls should keep the unique key metadata\r\n```sql\r\nselect concat(f0, f1)\r\n-- the type of f0 and f1 are both varchar originally and ignore nulls\r\nselect concat(cast(f0 as varchar), f1)\r\nselect cast(concat(f0, f1) as varchar)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the following sqls should discard the unique key metadata\r\n```sql\r\n-- the type of f0 and f1 are both varchar originally\r\nselect concat(cast(f0 as bigint), f1)\r\nselect cast(concat(f0, f1) as bigint)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nThis PR added a `BuildInToOutMapVisitor` in `FlinkRelMdUniqueKeys` to support preserving unique key metadata on using `convert` or `convert_ws` in a project node.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis PR added a new unit test `testGetUniqueKeysOnProjectWithConcat` in `FlinkRelMdUniqueKeysTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this

 What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix \"Hive functions can not work in blink planner stream mode\"\r\nisTableAggregate should get function instead of makeFunction.\r\n\r\nThe hive function should been make by correct constants and argTypes. Otherwise it will throw an exception. (See HiveAggSqlFunction)\r\nIn this isTableAggregate, it just want to check the aggregate function class type, so the better way is get the function instead of make a function.\r\n\r\n## Verifying

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n fix typo in ContaineredTaskManagerParameters\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)","created_at":"2019-10-28T08:23:31Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T11:37:22Z","closed_at":"2019-11-21T16:45:50Z","merged_at":"2019-11-21T16:45:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"4606fd63308772e49081da66bc25e7475b0c7141","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10012/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10012/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10012/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9f6d627dbc8321bededaffaf36d1ee956b79ead6","head":{"label":"zzchun:fix-typo-in-ContaineredTaskManagerParameters","ref":"fix-typo-in-ContaineredTaskManagerParameters","sha":"9f6d627dbc8321bededaffaf36d1ee956b79ead6","user":{"login":"zzchun","id":33080263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgwMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33080263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun","html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118125414,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTgxMjU0MTQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"zzchun/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zzchun","id":33080263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgwMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33080263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun","html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the bug when deploying on yarn in attach mode that flink client hangs after `Ctrl + C`. More information could be found at [FLINK-10435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10435).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* remove the `yarnClient.close()` in `failSessionDuringDeployment` and use a new yarn client in `DeploymentFailureHook`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n* Manually run a command to start flink cluster on yarn in attach mode. `./bin/flink run -m yarn-cluster examples/streaming/WindowJoin.jar`\r\n* When the application is in ACCEPTED status, send the `Ctrl + C`.\r\n* The flink client exits immediately.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-28T04:12:27Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:51:40Z","closed_at":"2019-10-29T15:39:08Z","merged_at":"2019-10-29T15:39:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"6378f82cdef490385f3c89e865902eca64531c8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273239272,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjM5Mjcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=CommandLineClient","name":"component=CommandLineClient","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10010/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10010/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10010/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/dfc134569403ee140c4bd3e51e264c8b3a6b6555","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-10435","ref":"FLINK-10435","sha":"dfc134569403ee140c4bd3e51e264c8b3a6b6555","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, all mails are always prioritized over regular input, which makes sense in most cases. However, it's easy to devise an operator that gets into starvation: each mail enqueues a new mail.\r\n\r\nIn concept, this ticket implements a simple extension in the mailbox processor: instead of draining the mailbox one-by-one, fetch all mails from the mailbox and run them one-by-one before running the default action. Only then, fetch all mails again and repeat. So we execute all mails that are available at the start of this loop but no mails that are added in the meantime.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add batch capability to `TaskMailbox`.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to set vertex slot sharing groups according to logical pipelined regions.\r\nIt is a pre-requisite of FLINK-14062: Set managed memory fractions according to slot sharing groups.\r\nThe changes are based on #9797 and #10006\r\n\r\nThe slot sharing group of a vertex is determined as:\r\n- if a vertex slot sharing group is specified to be null, the slot sharing group is null\r\n- if a vertex slot sharing group is specified to be a non-default value(the group name not \"default\"), it will be respected\r\n- if a vertex slot sharing group is \"default\", it will be the slot sharing group of the vertex's logical pipelined region\r\n\r\nThe slot sharing group of a region is determined as:\r\n- if allVerticesInSameSlotSharingGroupByDefault is true, all regions are in the same \"default\" slot sharing group\r\n- if allVerticesInSameSlotSharingGroupByDefault is false, all regions will be in distinct slot sharing groups\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *set vertex slot sharing group according to its logical pipelined regions.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests to verify slot sharing group assigning*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nLogical pipelined region partitioning is needed by FLINK-14060 to determine JobVertex slot sharing group.\r\nWe can leverage PipelinedRegionComputeUtil#computePipelinedRegions to do this by adapting JobGraph to a base Topology.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduced LogicalTopology which extends Topology*\r\n  - *Introduced LogicalPipelinedRegion*\r\n  - *Implemented DefaultLogicalTopology as an adapter of JobGraph to LogicalTopology*\r\n  - *Added DefaultLogicalTopology#getLogicalPipelinedRegions to return the logical pipelined regions of a JobGraph*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added tests for DefaultLogicalTopology/DefaultLogicalVertex/DefaultLogicalResult*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue [FLINK-14533](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14533) where using `LOWER/UPPER` in predicate would cause predicate pushdown to fail\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange `BuiltInFunctionDefinition` to match the `SqlFunction` string.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded tests\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-26T14:05:32Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T12:51:33Z","closed_at":"2020-02-19T12:51:33Z","merged_at":"2020-02-19T12:51:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"296a8af2250022b03c391bab9e8d17c98180aedd","assignee":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b27783f4b999b2c19759ea70b5b3968f67ff7b16","head":{"label":"YuvalItzchakov:feature/flink-14533_1","ref":"feature/flink-14533_1","sha":"b27783f4b999b2c19759ea70b5b3968f67ff7b16","user":{"login":"YuvalItzchakov","id":3448320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDgzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3448320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov","html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/events{/privacy}","received_

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue [FLINK-14533](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14533) where using `LOWER/UPPER` in predicate would cause predicate pushdown to fail\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange `BuiltInFunctionDefinition` to match the `SqlFunction` string.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded tests\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-26T13:19:18Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:49:20Z","closed_at":"2019-10-26T14:05:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b05014f1c69e2e6d4c1d7502d000567fa6702f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9a26157a38d33f03228fe3ae08956dfe922d0903","head":{"label":"YuvalItzchakov:feature/flink-14533","ref":"feature/flink-14533","sha":"9a26157a38d33f03228fe3ae08956dfe922d0903","user":{"login":"YuvalItzchakov","id":3448320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDgzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3448320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov","html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":207562755,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDc1NjI3NTU=","name":"flink","full_name":"YuvalItzchakov/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"YuvalItzchakov","id":3448320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDgzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3448320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov","html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen a resultant table is wide, the large number of non-trivial input unboxing code can push the generated byte code beyond the 64kb limit for some methods.  This PR splits them into individual methods.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIn CodeGen, when a split is needed, we create individual methods for each of the expressions inside `reusableInputUnboxingExprs`, which is in addition to the split of result setters.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThe code path in this change is exercised at the same time when existing code split takes place and all existing unit tests that verify code splits should be able to verify this.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-26T00:39:52Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:52:07Z","closed_at":"2019-10-30T03:14:25Z","merged_at":"2019-10-30T03:14:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c87259c1b931318a917eba665a219b63788a735","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1341819565,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzQxODE5NTY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/LegacyPlanner","name":"component=TableSQL/LegacyPlanner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0ea696c0c8581ca6df4957eb0c12f960e2b11fc5","head":{"label":"haodang:hdang/split_input_unboxing_exprs","ref":"hdang/split_input_unboxing_exprs","sha":"0ea696c0c8581ca6df4957eb0c12f960e2b11fc5","user":{"login":"haodang","id":2086034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODYwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2086034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang","html_url":"https://github.com/haodang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203233286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDMyMzMyODY=","name":"flink","full_name":"haodang/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haodang","id":2086034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODYwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2086034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang","html_url":"https://github.com/haodang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haodang/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*As suggested by @aljoscha in the JIRA, this pull request passes the inferred outputTypes from the ScalaAPI to the new `map` and `flatMap` function functions in the JavaAPI. An equivalent function already existed for `process`.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe Scala API did not pass the inferred output type to the `map` or the `flatMap` function in the Java API. So the Java type extractor tried to deduce the type and failed for Scala Case Classes.\r\nWith this pull request the inferred type is passed from the ScalaAPI to the JavaAPI.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes )\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-25T22:19:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:02:26Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T08:24:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7954676077d611020faf8fa6cf6e1f7cd46ec4f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244467905,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDY3OTA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=approved%20%E2%9C%85","name":"review=approved

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`sun.misc.Cleaner` is not available since Java 9.\r\n\r\nIt was moved to `jdk.internal.ref.Cleaner` of `java.base` module (Open JDK-8148117), but another new public API  was introduced to achieve the same behaviour: `java.lang.ref.Cleaner`;\r\n\r\nA popular solution is use reflection to look up for the location of the `Cleaner` class depending on running JVM version.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce `JavaGcCleanerWrapper` which uses reflection to look up and provide proper `Cleaner` implementation depending on JVM version on runtime\r\n  - Introduce `JavaGcCleanerWrapperTest` to test that the clean method is called \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun `JavaGcCleanerWrapperTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially

the PartitionTracker into a generic and JobMaster-specific part.\r\nThe core logic of the tracker hasn't changed, it was just generalized to allow arbitrary keys and meta information, instead of the currently hard-coded `ResourceID` and `ResultPartitionDeploymentDescriptor`.\r\n\r\nThe generic part contains methods for interacting with the underlying data-structores, while the JM part additionally releases partitions on the ShuffleMaster/TaskExecutor.\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to re-use the generic part on the TaskExecutor, enabling us to store arbitrary meta-info alongside each partition. (required for FLINK-14530)\r\n\r\nThe first commit renames the existing files for a cleaner diff, while the second one implements the actual separation. It is recommended to review the commits individually, for your sanity's sake

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo support Hive 1.1.0 and 1.1.1\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added two profiles and two shim implementations for 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 respectively.\r\n  - 1.1.x HMS always tries to compute some table stats during altering a non-partitioned table, which can override what we put in the table parameters. Therefore altering non-partitioned table stats for 1.1.x is disabled.\r\n  - DATE column stats are not supported in 1.1.x. Therefore shim methods are added to handle these column stats.\r\n  - Made `HiveShim` serializable because it's needed in `HiveGenericUDF` and `HiveGenericUDTF`. This change should have been made before this PR. We were good only because there's no test to expose this issue.\r\n  - Java constant object inspectors are not available in 1.1.x. Therefore added a shim method to get constant object inspectors. And because of this, we have to handle `Writable`s for Hive UDFs if they're initialized with some constant arguments. Added a conversion from Hive Java primitive to Hive Writable primitive for this.\r\n  - 1.1.x HCatalog artifacts are built with Hadoop-1 and incompatible with Hadoop-2. As a result, we cannot use the Hive runner to generate table data during tests. Added a util method to serve this purpose.\r\n  - For features unsupported by 1.1.x, related test cases are disabled for these old Hive versions.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCovered by existing test cases.\r\nManually verified by running `mvn verify -Phive-1.1.0` and `mvn verify -Phive-1.1.1`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs discussed in FLIP-66, the watermark information should be part of `TableSchema`, and expose to connectors vis `CatalogTable#getTableSchema`.\r\n\r\nWe may need to introduce a WatermarkSpec class to describe watermark information.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce `WatermarkSpec` class to describe watermark information.\r\n- `TableSchema#getWatermarkSpecs()` returns `List<WatermarkSpec>`, because we may support multiple watermarks in the future. This is for compatibility purpose. Currently, there is at most one watermark spec in the list. \r\n- Introduce `SqlExpression` which is an internal `ResolvedExpression` and wraps a SQL expression string. As discussed in [FLIP-80 ML](http://apache-flink-mailing-list-archive.1008284.n3.nabble.com/DISUCSS-FLIP-80-Expression-String-Serializable-and-Deserializable-td34146.html), we are planning to use SQL format as the string representation of `Expression`. However, the path of `Expression` -> `RexNode` -> `SqlNode` -> `String` still is not fully supported, and there are manay problems that need to be fixed in this path. So `SqlExpression` is a temporary solution to quickly support FLIP-66 as all the watermark expressions come from SQL DDL.\r\n- The properties representation of watermark information: \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"schema.watermark.0.rowtime\" -> \"f1.q2\"\r\n\"schema.watermark.0.strategy.expression\" -> \"`f1`.`q2` - INTERVAL '5' SECOND\"\r\n\"schema.watermark.0.strategy.datatype\" -> \"TIMESTAMP(3)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests:\r\n - Adds `TableSchemaTest` in `flink-table-common` to verify watermark relative logic in `TableSchema`. \r\n- Remove `TableSchemaTest` in `flink-table-planner` because of class name conflict, and move the tests from it to `TableEnvironmentTest` and `TableSchemaTest` in `flink-table-common`.\r\n- Adds `testTableSchema` in `DescriptorPropertiesTest` to verify the generated properties key-value string, and the derived `TableSchema` from properteis.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn order to best-effort implement non-blocking output, we need to further improve the interaction between LocalBufferPool and NetworkBufferPool in non-blocking way as a supplementation of FLINK-14396.\r\n\r\nIn detail, we provide the NetworkBufferPool#isAvailable to indicate the global pool state, then we could combine its state via LocalBufferPool#isAvailable method to avoid blocking in global request while task processing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we would refactor the process when LocalBufferPool requests global buffer. If there are no available buffers in NetworkBufferPool, the LocalBufferPool should monitor the global's available future instead of waiting 2 seconds currently in every loop retry. So we can solve the wait delay and cleanup the codes in a unified way.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - A new interface isAvailable which returns a CompletableFuture is added to the NetworkBufferPool. The future is completed when there are free segments in the pool.\r\n - LocalBufferPool will monitor the future returned by isAvailable and will be notified to retry to request MemorySegment from NetworkBufferPool when the future is complete.\r\n - Network buffer pool will maintain the state of buffer availability. The future will be transited to uncompleted state when there are no available segments and will be completed once there are available segments.\r\n - Two ut cases are added to verify the change.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTwo new ut cases are added to verify the change. One is for the new added isAvailable interface of NetworkBufferPool to verify that the buffer availability is correctly maintained and the future callback is correctly processed. And the other is for the interaction between LocalBufferPool and NetworkBufferPool to verify that blocking requests of multi local buffer pools can be fulfilled by recycled segments to the global network buffer pool.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- Create HiveModule to provide Hive built-in functions as system functions to Flink\r\n- Unify creation of HiveShim and reuse a single HiveShim in the stack to avoid creating new instances repeatedly\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- added HiveModule to instantiate Hive built-in functions for a specific hive version via HiveFunctionDefinitionFactory\r\n- refactored HiveFunctionDefinitionFactory to adapt to changes\r\n- added HiveModuleTest\r\n- Unify creation of HiveShim and reuse a single HiveShim in the stack to avoid creating new instances repeatedly. The only two entrances to create HiveShim are now HiveCatalog and HiveModule.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified in existing tests and in new `HiveModuleTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of FLINK-9953(Active Kubernetes integration). Entrypoint for a Kubernetes session cluster is added.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Add `KubernetesSessionClusterEntrypoint`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nJust a entrypoint for Kubernetes and most functionality is in `ClusterEntrypoint`. Will test it manually.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis PR is part of FLINK-9953(Active Kubernetes integration). Implement TaskManager Entrypoint for Kubernetes. `KubernetesTaskExecutorRunner` is the executable entry point for running a TaskExecutor in a Kubernetes pod. It will parse the dynamic configuration option in args and use the new configuration to run a task manager.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* add `KubernetesTaskExecutorRunner`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt is just a entrypoint class. All the functionality is in `TaskManagerRunner`. Will test it manually.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of FLINK-9953(Active Kubernetes integration). `KubernetesResourceManager` is introduced. It is responsible for allocating task manager pod dynamically on demand. A watcher is added to watch all the events of task manager pods. It filters the task manager pods by labels.\r\n\r\n`ServiceAccount` is used to start job manager pod. So the kubeClient could get the configuration by default. The kube config should not be taken from client for security reason.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #9957 #9965 #9973 .\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* Add KubernetesResourceManager implementation\r\n* Add test for start/stop worker\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added unit tests in `KubernetesResourceManagerTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen a resultant table is wide, the large number of non-trivial input unboxing code can push the generated byte code beyond the 64kb limit for some methods.  This PR splits them into individual methods.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIn CodeGen, when a split is needed, we create individual methods for each of the expressions inside `reusableInputUnboxingExprs`, which is in addition to the split of result setters.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThe code path in this change is exercised at the same time when existing code split takes place and all existing unit tests that verify code splits should be able to verify this.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-24T00:13:18Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:48:55Z","closed_at":"2019-10-26T00:40:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"248e02476aff89259f6070b4bb2bc06e87cdc357","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1341819565,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzQxODE5NTY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/LegacyPlanner","name":"component=TableSQL/LegacyPlanner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8c1978baeb72742f4f2cbfe37b13d4290c59bd10","head":{"label":"haodang:hdang/split-1.8","ref":"hdang/split-1.8","sha":"8c1978baeb72742f4f2cbfe37b13d4290c59bd10","user":{"login":"haodang","id":2086034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODYwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2086034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang","html_url":"https://github.com/haodang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203233286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDMyMzMyODY=","name":"flink","full_name":"haodang/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haodang","id":2086034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODYwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2086034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang","html_url":"https://github.com/haodang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haodang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haodang/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAll the queues in the YARN cluster are start with \"root\", while submitting applications to a queue with the queue name not starting with \"root\". will logs the queue does not exist. But the queue is exist and can submit applications to the queue, which is confusing for users. So,  while checking YARN queues should add  \"root.\" prefix. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

on #10050.\r\n\r\nWith this PR the TaskExecutor properly handles partitions that should be promoted. The corresponding partitions are removed from the `PartitionTable`, decoupling them from the job life-cycle, and added to a separate data-structure for book-keeping. This new data structure groups result partitions by IntermediateResultPartitionID, to simplify release calls issued by ResourceManagers (there is no use-case where only part of the intermediate result is to be released, hence there is no value in sending all ResultPartitionIDs from the RM to the TE).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if the ResourceManager disconnects all partitions will be released.","created_at":"2019-10-23T08:45:38Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:08:19Z","closed_at":"2019-11-14T10:24:47Z","merged_at":"2019-11-14T10:24:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"f892ccba45283a83f30014ee04b828a7979f622f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9975/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9975/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9975/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1102306beb22c032dc05a937f150cef9ab707c42","head":{"label":"zentol:14477","ref":"14477","sha":"1102306beb22c032dc05a937f150cef9ab707c42","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zentol/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change decouples the cluster/cluster client creation from the command line, by putting a configuration object in-between.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `CustomCommandLine` was responsible for the cluster client creation based on the methods:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClusterDescriptor<T> createClusterDescriptor(CommandLine commandLine) throws FlinkException;\r\n\r\nT getClusterId(CommandLine commandLine);\r\n\r\nClusterSpecification getClusterSpecification(CommandLine commandLine) throws FlinkException;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was an unnecessary coupling and also bad from a separation of concerns standpoint. Ideally, the `CLI` should be responsible for parsing the command line options only.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at doing exactly that. \r\n\r\n*Previously the command line options were directly passed to the descriptor and the specification from the `CustomCommandLine`. \r\n\r\n*Now the `CustomCommandLine` only has a method:\r\n```\r\nConfiguration applyCommandLineOptionsToConfiguration(CommandLine commandLine) throws FlinkException;\r\n``` \r\nwhich maps the command-line options to a configuration object and this object is then used to:\r\n1. instantiate the correct `ClusterClientFactory` (Yarn or Standalone currently) based on the `execution.target` config option.\r\n2. create the adequate `ClusterDescriptor`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe previous `CustomCommandLine` is now only responsible for translating the CLI-options to a configuration.\r\n\r\nA new `ClusterClientFactory` abstraction is introduced with the following methods that take care of cluster creation/ retrieval: \r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Returns {@code true} if the current {@link ClusterClientFactory} is compatible with the provided configuration, {@code false} otherwise.\r\n */\r\n\tboolean isCompatibleWith(Configuration configuration);\r\n\r\n\tClusterDescriptor<ClusterID> createClusterDescriptor(Configuration configuration);\r\n\r\n\t@Nullable\r\n\tClusterID getClusterId(Configuration configuration);\r\n\r\n\tClusterSpecification getClusterSpecification(Configuration configuration);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is mainly covered by existing test. Some additional tests are added for the service discovery part.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n\r\n**This PR is part of FLIP-73 and the new configuration options it introduces are under voting process with FLIP-81. This PR is here for pre-reviewing but it will only be merged after FLIP-81 is

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of FLINK-9953. `KubernetesClusterDescriptor` is added to support deploy session cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #9957 #9965 #9986.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Add Kubernetes ClusterDescriptor to support deploying session cluster\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added related unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-23T07:26:33Z","updated_at":"2019-12-08T11:03:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-08T10:26:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09b3837e30eef1f105928f879d3dd542eec8fb26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273239272,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjM5Mjcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=CommandLineClient","name":"component=CommandLineClient","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1bd7fa188ecc6814435d18f409a5e3629c717365","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-9955","ref":"FLINK-9955","sha":"1bd7fa188ecc6814435d18f409a5e3629c717365","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nExclude detach flag from ClusterClient.\r\n\r\n1. Remove field `ClusterClient#detachedJobSubmission`\r\n2. Remove method `ClusterClient#submitJob(JobGraph, ClassLoader)`, it is always required when distinguish whether detached or not are important. We already have `ClusterClient#submitJob(JobGraph)` and the ClassLoader is used for deserializing accumulations, which is not required if it is just a submission.\r\n3. Inline detach branches.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis PR is part of FLINK-9953(Active Kubernetes integration).  This PR introduces the `FlinkKubeClient` API and adds fabric8 implementation. The following k8s resource decorators are added to support for basic k8s integration.\r\n* Service, internal service is used for tm->jm hearbeat, rest service is used for flink client to submit job.\r\n* ConfigMap, save the flink-conf.yaml and log4j config files. It will be mounted into jm/tm pod.\r\n* Deployment, for job manager. When it crashes exceptionally, a new one will be started.\r\n* Pod, for task manager. It will created by `KubernetesResourceManager`.\r\n* OwnerReference, all resources are set owner reference to internal service. When the internal service is deleted, they will be deleted by gc.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #9695.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Add config options and cli options for kubernetes\r\n  - Add FlinkKubeClient API and basic kubernetes resources\r\n  - Add fabric8 kubeClient implementation and decorators\r\n  - Add tests for fabric8 FlinkKubeClient implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added `Fabric8ClientTest` public api implementation of `FlinkKubeClient`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-22T05:22:45Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T13:23:50Z","closed_at":"2019-12-05T05:50:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f12d903deff7be32ad44b3bc066caaa2aea6bde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1b37e8e6ea81bf3a3ec5577637d8695efe387230","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-10935","ref":"FLINK-10935","sha":"1b37e8e6ea81bf3a3ec5577637d8695efe387230","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnable referencing functions with fully qualified name in FunctionCatalog.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- added FunctionIdentifier to represent path of either system function or catalog function\r\n- changed FunctionCatalog.lookupFunction() interface and enabled to look up functions via FunctionIdentifier\r\n- since FunctionCatalog assumes function names should be case-insensitive, catalog needs to store catalog function names in a case-insensitive way, like HiveCatalog. So we had to made GenericInMemoryCatalog store and lookup function names in lower case. (This should probably apply to all object names of GenericInMemoryCatalog, but let's do the most relevant part first)\r\n- added UT\r\n- misc changes to lots of places in planner\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- FunctionCatalogTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull request will let `YarnJobClusterEntrypoint` use the user code class loader if setting the yarn.per-job-cluster.include-user-jar to \"DISABLE\".\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - `YarnClusterDescriptor` does not put the user jars to the system classpath and put the user jar to the \"job/\" dir if setting `yarn.per-job-cluster.include-user-jar` to \"DISABLE\".\r\n  - `FileJobGraphRetriever` adds the user classpath to the `JobGraph` if it is not empty.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added integration test for verifying that `YarnJobClusterEntrypoint` could use user code class loader \r\n  - Added integration test for verifying that the user will get notified error if there is a ship dir, whose name is \"job\" when setting yarn.per-job-cluster.include-user-jar to \"DISABLE\".\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-21T16:36:28Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:57:50Z","closed_at":"2019-11-04T16:15:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"862c0320dd2140fabff79f80455bdc5e6156e300","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9961/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9961/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9961/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0974293131e288d8c1789d295435a468b2296163","head":{"label":"guoweiM:FLINK-14466","ref":"FLINK-14466","sha":"0974293131e288d8c1789d295435a468b2296163","user":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85899056,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTg5OTA1Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"guoweiM/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM/flink","description":"Mirror

independently.","created_at":"2019-10-21T13:46:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:48:38Z","closed_at":"2019-10-25T20:54:01Z","merged_at":"2019-10-25T20:54:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"bebd27d62612e27307956a1a13c74e6111907075","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/36e109666373d10b23ad0d972f19abd11b83c6ab","head":{"label":"zentol:14475","ref":"14475","sha":"36e109666373d10b23ad0d972f19abd11b83c6ab","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.git

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of FLINK-9953(Active Kubernetes integration). Add a new module and pom for flink-kubernetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Create a new module named with flink-kubernetes\r\n* Add flink-kubernetes module in flink and flink-dist pom\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe kubernetes-client classes is in flink-dist.jar and all its dependencies have been shadded.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Enriches `RpcEndpoint.MainThreadExecutor` by supporting periodic scheduling. So that `CheckpointCoordinator` could schedule triggering periodically through main thread executor\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Refines `ScheduledFutureTask` from `ActorSystemScheduledExecutorAdapter`\r\n  * It would be used both in `ActorSystemScheduledExecutorAdapter` and `MainThreadExecutor`\r\n* Adds tests for `ActorSystemScheduledExecutorAdapter`\r\n* Unifies the `ScheduledFutureAdapter` with `ScheduledFutureTask`\r\n* Removes dead code `ScheduledFutureAdapter`\r\n* Supports periodic scheduling in `MainThreadExecutor`\r\n  * Uses `ScheduledExecutor` from `RpcService#getScheduledExecutor` to execute `scheduleAtFixedRate`. There will be fewer messages than directly executing it (manually scheduling next task before executing the current one) in main thread\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* This change added

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull requests make the `StandaloneJobClusterEntrypoint` use the user code class loader.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - link the `FLINK_JOB_ARTIFACTS_DIR` to the `FLINK_HOME/job` dir\r\n  - `ClassPathJobGraphRetriever` constructs a user code classpath from `FLINK_HOME/job`\r\n  - `ClassPathJobGraphRetriever` sets the user code classpath to `PacakgeProgram`\r\n  - `ClassPathJobGraphRetriever` uses the `packageProgram` to build a jobgraph with the user clode classpath\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Extended the test that validates`ClassPathJobGraphRetriever` can retrieve a `JobGraph` with correct user classpath\r\n - Extended the test that validates `PackagedProgram` can create a `JobGraph` even if the `jarFile` param of the constructor is null\r\n  - execute the `test_docker_embedded_job.sh` manually to verify the StandaloneJobCluster runs well.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently there are 3 failover topology instances created, 2 permanently kept in JM. 2 scheduling topology instances created permanently kept in JM. It a waste of computation to build the topologies and memory to keep these topologies. Which may be a significant issue when the job scale is large.\r\n\r\nWith FLINK-14450 and FLINK-14451, the SchedulingTopology and FailoverTopology are able to share one default implementation. It enables us to change the scheduler to create and keep only one such an execution topology instance to reduce the cost to build and host execution topologies.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to change the scheduler to create and keep only one execution topology instance.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *hotfix: Rename ExecutionGraphToSchedulingTopologyAdapter to DefaultExecutionTopology*\r\n  - *Remove duplicated execution topology creation and keep the only created one*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests of scheduling and failover*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport to parse watermark syntax in SQL DDL. \r\n\r\nThe watermark syntax is as following:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWATERMARK FOR columnName AS <watermark_strategy_expression>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should also do some validation during parsing, for example, whether the referenced rowtime field exist. We should also support to reference a nested field as the rowtime field.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds parsing logic in sql-parser module.\r\n- Adds validation for rowtime field reference in `SqlCreateTable`, allows nested fields as rowtime field. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Adds DDL test cases in `FlinkSqlParserImplTest` for watermarks.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request updates the Kubernetes documentation to use the current `Deployment` resource and run unprivileged*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Docs update*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  no\r\n  - The serializers:  no \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no \r\n  - The S3 file system connector:  no \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-20T13:30:42Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:05:46Z","closed_at":"2019-11-12T12:06:36Z","merged_at":"2019-11-12T12:06:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d8081f65095de092e08150adf5d301c74a38530","assignee":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9946/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9946/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9946/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1b11e255cf80c60127ff6ff731bf875debcbc7a4","head":{"label":"mbode:FLINK-14468","ref":"FLINK-14468","sha":"1b11e255cf80c60127ff6ff731bf875debcbc7a4","user":{"login":"mbode","id":9051309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTEzMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9051309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode","html_url":"https://github.com/mbode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53203927,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzIwMzkyNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"mbode/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbode","id":9051309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTEzMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9051309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode","html_url":"https://github.com/mbode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixes a race condition described detailedly in [FLINK-14434](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14434#).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nLet `Dispatcher#createJobManagerRunner` returns on creation succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI think this change is straightforward and current behavior doesn't break guarded by existing tests. The diff attached on corresponding JIRA can reproduce the issue but I'm afraid it is always invasive to emulate this case(add a debug latch between `jobManagerRunner.start` and `return` for testing hook in my mind). Due to the change is straightforward and easy to reason, I tend to avoid invasive testing hook.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTowards a `ClusterClient` interface.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Exclude lastJobExecutionResult from ClusterClient. Client only returns the result in submit, the tweaking logic in ContextEnvironment is hacky resolved by hold a container of execution result in ContextEnvironment.\r\n\r\n2. Shift down ClusterClient#configuration. A follow up could be figure out what configuration is exactly used.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for spreading slots out across all currently registered `TaskExecutors`.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be enabled by setting `cluster.evenly-spread-out-slots: true` in Flink's configuration file.\r\n\r\nIf the feature is enabled, then Flink's `ResourceManager` tries to fulfill slot requests with slots whose `TaskExecutor's` utilization is minimal if there are multiple slots matching the resource requirements.\r\n\r\nThe `TaskExecutor's` utilization is calculated by `usedSlots / totalSlots`.\r\n\r\nOn the `JobMaster` side, the `SlotPool` tries to do the same wrt to the available slots being allocated for this job. This means that the `SlotPool` always picks the slot with the least utilization if there are multiple slots fulfilling the resource requirements.\r\n\r\nHere the `TaskExecutor's` utilization is calculates by `usedSlotsByJob / totalSlotsOfferedToJob`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* 5f74a8f: Introduce SlotMatchingStrategy for SlotManager\r\n\r\nThe SlotMatchingStrategy encapsulates how the SlotManager finds a matching slot\r\nfor a slot request. At the moment, the only implementation AnyMatchingSlotMatchingStrategy\r\npicks any matching slot.\r\n\r\n* 752462a: Add LeastUtilizationSlotMatchingStrategy for spreading slot allocations out\r\n\r\nThe LeastUtilizationSlotMatchingStrategy picks the matching slots which belongs to a\r\nTaskExecutor with the least utilization value. That way the SlotManager will spread out\r\nslot allocations across all available/registered TaskExecutors.\r\n\r\n* 5511ada: [FLINK-12122] Introduce ClusterOptions#EVENLY_SPREAD_OUT_SLOTS_STRATEGY\r\n\r\nAdd config option to enable to evenly spread out slots across all available\r\nTaskExecutors.\r\n\r\n* bbb0723: Calculate TaskExecutorUtilization when listing available slots\r\n\r\nWhen listing available slots stored in the SlotPool and the SlotSharingManager, the system\r\nwill now also calculate the utilization of the owning TaskExecutor wrt the job.\r\n\r\n* 268e688: Add EvenlySpreadOutLocationPreferenceSlotSelectionStrategy\r\n\r\nThe EvenlySpreadOutLocationPreferenceSlotSelectionStrategy is a special implementation of\r\nthe LocationPreferenceSlotSelectionStrategy which tries to evenly spread out the workload\r\nacross all TaskExecutors by choosing the slot with the least utilization if there is a tie\r\nwrt the locality.\r\n\r\n* 86b81f9: Choose SlotSelectionStrategy based on ClusterOptions#EVENLY_SPREAD_OUT_SLOTS_STRATEGY\r\n\r\nIf ClusterOptions#EVENLY_SPREAD_OUT_SLOTS_STRATEGY is enabled, then Flink will use the evenly spread\r\nout location preference strategy to spread out the workload as much as possible.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added tests: `SlotPoolSlotSpreadOutTest`, `AnyMatchingSlotMatchingStrategyTest`, `LeastUtilizationSlotMatchingStrategyTest`, `SlotPoolImplTest#testCalculationOfTaskExecutorUtilization`, `SlotSharingManagerTest#testTaskExecutorUtilizationCalculation`, `SlotManagerImplTest#testSpreadOutSlotAllocationStrategy`\r\n\r\n- Tried out manually\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the issue that calling Hive UDTF with array arguments causes cast exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - When reading array type from Hive table, create arrays according to element type instead of Object[].\r\n  - Add test case to cover it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew test case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
