[KAFKA-10454](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10454) bug\r\n\r\nMain issue was that when optimization algorithm was removing repartition nodes, corresponding `copartitionSourceGroups` was never updated. As a result, copartition enforcer wasn't able to do the checks and set proper number of partitions.\r\n\r\nTest ensures that whenever optimization is set, changelog topic for the table is not created.

change sets the groundwork for migrating other modules incrementally.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n- Replace `junit` 4.13 with `junit-jupiter` and `junit-vintage` 5.7.0-RC1.\r\n- All modules except for `tools` depend on `junit-vintage`.\r\n- `tools` depends on `junit-jupiter`.\r\n- Convert `tools` tests to JUnit 5.\r\n- Update `PushHttpMetricsReporterTest` to use `mockito` instead of `powermock` and `easymock`\r\n(powermock doesn't seem to work well with JUnit 5 and we don't need it since mockito can mock\r\nstatic methods).\r\n- Update `mockito` to 3.5.7.\r\n- Update `TestUtils` to use JUnit 5 assertions since `tools` depends on it.\r\n\r\nUnrelated clean-ups:\r\n- Remove `unit` from package names in a few `core` tests.\r\n- Replace `try/catch/fail` with `assertThrows` in a number of places.\r\n- Tag `CoordinatorTest` as integration test.\r\n- Remove unnecessary type parameters when invoking methods and constructors.\r\n\r\nTested with IntelliJ and gradle. Verified that the following commands work as expected:\r\n* ./gradlew tools:unitTest\r\n* ./gradlew tools:integrationTest\r\n* ./gradlew tools:test\r\n* ./gradlew core:unitTest\r\n* ./gradlew core:integrationTest\r\n* ./gradlew clients:test\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-30T23:03:18Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T23:14:43Z","closed_at":"2020-09-10T23:14:39Z","merged_at":"2020-09-10T23:14:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d0086e0c35d827a46e82956f42af57f6a6539f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/eae51a3f5dd5b5d988a67e10f48ed9f6d7f2a054","head":{"label":"ijuma:junit5-tools","ref":"junit5-tools","sha":"eae51a3f5dd5b5d988a67e10f48ed9f6d7f2a054","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32646946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjY0Njk0Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"ijuma/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma/kafka","description":"Mirror

a caching `BufferSupplier` per request handler thread so that\r\ndecompression buffers are cached if supported by the underlying\r\n`CompressionType`. This achieves a similar outcome as #9220, but\r\nwith less contention.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a `RequestLocal` class to make it easier to introduce\r\nnew request scoped stateful instances (one example we discussed\r\npreviously was an `ActionQueue` that could be used to avoid\r\nsome of the complex group coordinator locking).\r\n\r\nThis is a small win for zstd (no synchronization or soft references) and\r\na more significant win for lz4. In particular, it reduces allocations\r\nsignificantly when the number of partitions is high. The decompression\r\nbuffer size is typically 64 KB, so a produce request with 1000 partitions\r\nresults in 64 MB of allocations even if each produce batch is small (likely,\r\nwhen there are so many partitions).\r\n\r\nI did a quick producer perf local test with 5000 partitions, 1 KB record\r\nsize,\r\n1 broker, lz4 and ~0.5 for the producer compression rate metric:\r\n\r\nBefore this change:\r\n> 20000000 records sent, 346314.349535 records/sec (330.27 MB/sec),\r\n148.33 ms avg latency, 2267.00 ms max latency, 115 ms 50th, 383 ms 95th, 777 ms 99th, 1514 ms 99.9th.\r\n\r\nAfter this change:\r\n> 20000000 records sent, 431956.113259 records/sec (411.95 MB/sec),\r\n117.79 ms avg latency, 1219.00 ms max latency, 99 ms 50th, 295 ms 95th, 440 ms 99th, 662 ms 99.9th.\r\n\r\nThat's a 25% throughput improvement and p999 latency was reduced to\r\nunder half (in this test).\r\n\r\nDefault arguments will be removed in a subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

`org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Values#parse` method parses integers, which are larger than `Long.MAX_VALUE` as `double` with `Schema.FLOAT64_SCHEMA`.\r\n\r\nThat means we are losing precision for these larger integers.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nSchemaAndValue schemaAndValue = Values.parseString(\"9223372036854775808\");\r\n```\r\nreturns:\r\n```\r\nSchemaAndValue{schema=Schema{FLOAT64}, value=9.223372036854776E18}\r\n```\r\nAlso, this method parses values, that can be parsed as `FLOAT32` to `FLOAT64`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes parsing logic, to use `FLOAT32`/`FLOAT64` for numbers that don't have and fraction part(`decimal.scale()!=0`) only, and use an arbitrary-precision `org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal` otherwise.\r\nAlso, it updates the method to parse numbers, that can be represented as `float` to `FLOAT64`.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests, that cover parsing `BigInteger`, `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double` types.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

users of Suppress in strict mode must either not configure a memory bound or consider a per-operator, per-partition bound. The former would result in the application crashing ungracefully if it needs too much memory, which is sub-optimal for some deployment strategies. The latter is nice for determinism, but is difficult to configure in practice.\r\n\r\nIn addition to suppress buffers, Streams has a record cache configuration. Currently, we make the assumption that all threads would probably use a uniform amount of cache space, but this assumption is clearly wrong in some cases.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are some applications that want to run multiple Streams instances in the same JVM, probably for running different Streams topologies.\r\n\r\nIn aggregate, there are quite a few \"pools\" of heap space that users need to configure if they want to avoid an OOME, and the more threads, applications, and Suppress operators there are, the more granular these pools become. Of course, the more granular the pools are, the lower utilization of the available memory we will see. Plus, especially for Suppression, very granular pool configuration means a higher likelihood that the operator will run out of space and shut the app down.\r\n\r\nThis POC demonstrates the feasibility of unifying all these pools with one logical bound on total memory usage for all caches and suppression buffers, across all operators/tasks and all threads, and even across all Streams instances in the JVM.\r\n\r\nMost of the tests pass right now, but not all of them. I also need to clean up a few more things before really starting a discussion.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

the amount of time available to the `test_verifiable_producer` test to login and get the process name for the verifiable producer from 5 seconds to 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe were seeing some test failures due to the assertion failing because the verifiable producer would complete before we could login, list the processes, and parse out the producer version. Previously, we were giving this operation 5 seconds to run, this PR bumps it up to 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nI verified locally that this does not flake, but even at 5 seconds I wasn't seeing any flakes.

a topic config with the `kafka-topics` command while connecting to Kafka via `--bootstrap-server` (rather than connecting to ZooKeeper via `--zookeeper`) is not supported. The desired functionality is available elsewhere, though: it is possible to change a topic config while connecting to Kafka rather than ZooKeeper via the `kafka-configs` command instead. However, neither the `kafka-topics` error message received nor the `kafka-topics` help information itself indicates this other possibility. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter --topic test --config flush.messages=12345\r\nOption combination \"[bootstrap-server],[config]\" can't be used with option \"[alter]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kafka-topics.sh\r\n...\r\n--config <String: name=value> A topic configuration override for the topic being created or altered...It is supported only in combination with – create if --bootstrap-server option is used.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRather than simply saying that what you want to do isn't available, it would be better to say also that you can do it with the `kafka-configs` command.","created_at":"2020-08-18T21:30:37Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T06:28:23Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T06:28:23Z","merged_at":"2020-08-21T06:28:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1db4a8010b44498962475e33c34817f3922f6e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a8b2cdc279360f74ebc98b086926901c6971574a","head":{"label":"rondagostino:KAFKA-10418","ref":"KAFKA-10418","sha":"a8b2cdc279360f74ebc98b086926901c6971574a","user":{"login":"rondagostino","id":6076159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzYxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6076159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino","html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":117853091,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTc4NTMwOTE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"rondagostino/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rondagostino","id":6076159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzYxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6076159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino","html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino/kafka","description":"Mirror

may have data\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of different situations which can result in\r\nBUFFER_OVERFLOW on read with the current implementation, due to the\r\nwhile loop structure (such as TLS compression with identical buffer\r\nsizes, or buffers sizes that differ to optimize modes where the cipher\r\ntext is larger than the plain text.)  The JDK documentation indicates\r\nthat a buffer of getApplicationBufferSize() bytes will be enough for a\r\nsingle unwrap operation, but the SslTransportLayer loop may call unwrap\r\nwith an application buffer which isn't empty.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation will check dst for space and then move data\r\nfrom the application buffer.  It will then continue the loop and may try\r\nto unwrap() again without verifying that there are\r\ngetApplicationBufferSize() bytes free in the application buffer. If,\r\ninstead, the loop moves data into dst, and then breaks the loop if dst\r\nis full, then unwrap() should never be called with data in the\r\napplication

But while the directory change, we forgot to remove the topicPartition offset data in old directory, which will cause there are more than 1 checkpoint copy stayed in the logs for the altered topicPartition. And it'll let the LogCleaner get stuck due to it's possible to always get the old topicPartition offset data from the old checkpoint file. \r\n\r\nI added one more parameter `topicPartitionToBeRemoved` in `updateCheckpoints()` method.

Context \r\nI need to create topics on the fly from database table names (cdc) and I'm replacing all `_` with `-`.\r\nWith current RegexRouter I can't do this in one call (actually if I don't know the number of `_` I don't know how many times I need to call the transformer).\r\n\r\nThat's the reason why I implemented a new flag to allow replaceAll on RegexRouter.\r\n\r\n### Change applied\r\nI added a new flag `replaceAll` of type `Boolean` with default value `false` which allows to apply a regex replacement in all occurencces of the topic name.\r\nI updated the description of the transformer and added 2 tests to cover previous and new behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Testing strategy (Unit test)\r\nI created a new topic name with two `_` symbols (`sample_table_name`).\r\nI called a regex with current implementation expecting only the first `_` to be substituted.\r\nI called a regex with new flag expecting all `_` to be replaced with `-`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

[KIP-113](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-113%3A+Support+replicas+movement+between+log+directories), we support replicas movement between log directories. But while the directory change, we forgot to remove the topicPartition offset data in old directory, which will cause there are more than 1 checkpoint copy stayed in the logs for the altered topicPartition. And it'll let the LogCleaner get stuck due to it's possible to always get the old topicPartition offset data from the old checkpoint file. \r\n\r\nI added one more parameter `topicPartitionToBeRemoved` in `updateCheckpoints()` method. So, if the `update` parameter is `None` (as before), we'll do the remove action to remove the `topicPartitionToBeRemoved` data in dir, otherwise, update the data as before.\r\n\r\n### Committer

of configs for custom topic creation with KIP-158 created a regression when transformation configs are also included in the configuration of a source connector. \r\n\r\nTo experience the issue, just enabling topic creation at the worker is not sufficient. A user needs to supply a source connector configuration that contains both transformations and custom topic creation properties. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that the enrichment of configs in `SourceConnectorConfig` happens on top of an `AbstractConfig` rather than a `ConnectorConfig`. Inheriting from the latter allows enrichment to be composable for both topic creation and transformations. \r\n\r\nUnit tests and integration tests are written to test these combinations. \r\n\r\n###

from the jira:\r\n\r\nIn testing my project, I discovered that the MockProducer is not thread safe as I thought. It doesn't use thread safe libraries for it's underlying stores, and only some of it’s methods are synchronised.\r\n \r\nAs performance isn’t an issue for this, I would propose simply synchronising all public methods in the class, as some already are.\r\n \r\nIn my project, send is synchronised and commit transactions isn’t. This was causing weird collection manipulation and messages going missing. My lolcat only solution was simply to synchronise on the MockProducer instance before calling commit.\r\n \r\nSee my workaround:

broker throws IllegalStateException if the broker epoch in the LeaderAndIsr/UpdateMetadataRequest/StopReplicaRequest is larger than its current broker epoch. However, there is no guarantee that the broker would receive the latest broker epoch before the controller: when the broker registers with ZK, there are few more instructions to process before this broker \"knows\" about its epoch, while the controller may already get notified and send UPDATE_METADATA request (as an example) with the new epoch.

broker throws IllegalStateException if the broker epoch in the LeaderAndIsr/UpdateMetadataRequest/StopReplicaRequest is larger than its current broker epoch. However, there is no guarantee that the broker would receive the latest broker epoch before the controller: when the broker registers with ZK, there are few more instructions to process before this broker \"knows\" about its epoch, while the controller may already get notified and send UPDATE_METADATA request (as an example) with the new epoch. This will result in clients getting stale metadata from this broker.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, a broker accepts LeaderAndIsr/UpdateMetadataRequest/StopReplicaRequest if the broker epoch is newer than the current epoch.\r\n\r\nReviewers: David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

is a backport of #8509.\r\n\r\nA broker throws IllegalStateException if the broker epoch in the LeaderAndIsr/UpdateMetadataRequest/StopReplicaRequest is larger than its current broker epoch. However, there is no guarantee that the broker would receive the latest broker epoch before the controller: when the broker registers with ZK, there are few more instructions to process before this broker \"knows\" about its epoch, while the controller may already get notified and send UPDATE_METADATA request (as an example) with the new epoch. This will result in clients getting stale metadata from this broker.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, a broker accepts LeaderAndIsr/UpdateMetadataRequest/StopReplicaRequest if the broker epoch is newer than the current epoch.\r\n\r\nReviewers: David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

WorkerSinkTaskContext, if the offsets are not empty, then in the [rewind() method](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/WorkerSinkTask.java#L615-L633), run **consumer.seek(tp, offset)** to rewind the consumer.\r\n\r\nAs a part of [WorkerSinkTask initialization](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/WorkerSinkTask.java#L290-L307), when the [SinkTask starts](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/api/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/sink/SinkTask.java#L83-L88), we can supply the specific offsets by **context.offset(supplied_offsets);** in start() method, so that when the consumer does the first poll in WorkerSinkTask, it should rewind to the specific offsets in rewind() method. However in practice, we saw the following IllegalStateException when running consumer.seek(tp, offsets);\r\n\r\n`\r\n[2020-08-07 23:53:55,752] INFO WorkerSinkTask{id=MirrorSinkConnector-0} Rewind

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41008610/kafkaconsumer-0-10-java-api-error-message-no-current-assignment-for-partition/41010594, the resolution (that has been initially verified) proposed in this PR is to use consumer.assign() with consumer.seek(), instead of consumer.subscribe, to handle the initial position of the consumer, when specific offsets are provided by external through
