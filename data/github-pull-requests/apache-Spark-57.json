What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to update the documentation in `errors.rst` by replacing external hyperlink with internal (relative) link. Specifically, it changes the link in the 'Contributing Error and Exception' section from an absolute URL to a relative path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause using internal links in the documentation ensures that the links remain valid and consistent with the latest documentation, even after updates or restructuring. It also reduces the risk of broken links in the future. Internal links provide a more reliable and maintainable approach to linking related content within the PySpark documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it only affects the documentation's hyperlinks, improving their reliability and maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes were manually reviewed to ensure that the new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support a new configuration `spark.master.rest.host` to allow REST Server to choose a host to listen.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR is a re-try of #42841 which was closed in favor of `SPARK_MASTER_HOST`.\r\n\r\nIf we use `SPARK_MASTER_HOST`,\r\n- `Worker` should use `spark.worker.preferConfiguredMasterAddress=true` always to ignore the address from Master. It's an overhead.\r\n- Moreover, there exists a conner case like the following where `Worker` received `ReconnectWorker` like the following. It's very confusing to the users.\r\n- We had better support `spark.master.rest.host` instead of using a workaround environment variable, `SPARK_MASTER_HOST`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/80dc64a573e1c7678f92f8690f09a52329f7d30b/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/master/Master.scala#L335\r\n```\r\n23/12/08 04:56:57 INFO Worker: Worker cleanup enabled; old application directories will be deleted in: /data/spark\r\n23/12/08 04:59:34 INFO Worker: Master with url spark://0.0.0.0:7077 requested this worker to reconnect.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis allows additional controllability on the REST Server.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in K8s environment, K8s port-forwarding only works with 127.0.0.1.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl port-forward svc/master 6066\r\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:6066 -> 6066\r\nForwarding from [::1]:6066 -> 6066\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to use `port-forward` because the AS-IS Spark REST Server only listens the podIP and not 127.0.0.1. \r\n\r\nWe can use `spark.master.rest.host=0.0.0.0` with this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was a little difficult to write a unit test code because it requires two IPs to test in CI.\r\n\r\nFor manual testing, start the REST API.\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=1 SPARK_MASTER_OPTS=\"-Dspark.master.rest.enabled=true -Dspark.master.rest.host=0.0.0.0\" sbin/start-master.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, connect with both IPs (your public IP and 127.0.0.1) on the machine.\r\n```\r\n$ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:6066/v1/submissions/status/0 \r\n$ curl -v http://a.b.c.d:6066/v1/submissions/status/0 \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-08T05:35:25Z","updated_at":"2023-12-08T07:10:29Z","closed_at":"2023-12-08T07:01:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e52068b4cf9be07f33cfa3565db18fe34835b59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff51fc38266e6bb6a769018ceabf87e5b607d1ae","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-46320","ref":"SPARK-46320","sha":"ff51fc38266e6bb6a769018ceabf87e5b607d1ae","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is another approach of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43784 which proposes to support Python Data Source can be with SQL (in favour of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43949), SparkR and all other exiting combinations by wrapping the Python Data Source by DSv2 interface (but yet uses `V1Table` interface).\r\n\r\nThe approach is: one Python Data Source wrapper looks up Python data sources\r\n\r\nSelf-contained working example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.datasource import DataSource, DataSourceReader, InputPartition\r\n\r\nclass TestDataSourceReader(DataSourceReader):\r\n    def __init__(self, options):\r\n        self.options = options\r\n    def partitions(self):\r\n        return [InputPartition(i) for i in range(3)]\r\n    def read(self, partition):\r\n        yield partition.value, str(partition.value)\r\n\r\nclass TestDataSource(DataSource):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def name(cls):\r\n        return \"test\"\r\n    def schema(self):\r\n        return \"x INT, y STRING\"\r\n    def reader(self, schema) -> \"DataSourceReader\":\r\n        return TestDataSourceReader(self.options)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.dataSource.register(TestDataSource)\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE tblA USING test\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT * from tblA\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  x|  y|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  0|  0|\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n|  2|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n_There are limitations and followups to make:_\r\n\r\n1. Statically loading Python Data Sources is still not supported (SPARK-45917)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order for Python Data Source to be able to be used in all other place including SparkR, Scala together.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Users can register their Python Data Source, and use them in SQL, SparkR, etc.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added, and manually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-31464 | https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28235 specifies that the Zookeeper version used for testing in the `streaming-kafka-0-10` and `sql-kafka-0-10` modules is 3.5.7, while at that time, the default Zookeeper version used by Spark was 3.4.14.\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-45956, the default Zookeeper version used by Spark was upgraded to 3.9.1, which is higher than both 3.5.7 and 3.6.4, the latter being used by the Kafka 3.4.1 embedded server. This PR try to make the `streaming-kafka-0-10` and `sql-kafka-0-10` modules also use the project's default Zookeeper version(3.9.1) for testing, rather than relying on a special version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake the `streaming-kafka-0-10` and `sql-kafka-0-10` modules use the default Zookeeper version of Spark for testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-12-07T07:05:14Z","updated_at":"2023-12-07T16:54:03Z","closed_at":"2023-12-07T16:54:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d528dfb31f5997e5c57f3d81164c72791b26059e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for catalog error cases for `createExternalTable`.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR includes several minor cleanups:\r\n- Show a deprecation for `spark.catalog.createExternalTable` (to match with the non-Spark Connect)\r\n- Remove `_reset` at `Catalog` which is not used anywhere.\r\n- Switch the implementation of Spark Connect `spark.catalog.createExternalTable` to directly call `spark.catalog.createTable`, and remove the corresponding Python protobuf definition.\r\n  - this PR does not remove the protobuf message definition itself for potential compatibility concern.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- For feature parity.\r\n- To improve the test coverage.\r\n    See https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/spark/commit/1a651753f4e760643d719add3b16acd311454c76/blob/python/pyspark/sql/catalog.py\r\n\r\nThis is not being tested.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a back-port of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44193.\r\n\r\nIn `RewritePredicateSubquery`, prune existence flags from the final join when `rewriteExistentialExpr` returns an existence join. This change prunes the flags (attributes with the name \"exists\") by adding a `Project` node.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nJoin LeftSemi, ((a#13 = c1#15) OR exists#19)\r\n:- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#19), (a#13 = col1#17)\r\n:  :- LocalRelation [a#13]\r\n:  +- LocalRelation [col1#17]\r\n+- LocalRelation [c1#15]\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\nProject [a#13]\r\n+- Join LeftSemi, ((a#13 = c1#15) OR exists#19)\r\n   :- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#19), (a#13 = col1#17)\r\n   :  :- LocalRelation [a#13]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [col1#17]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [c1#15]\r\n```\r\nThis change always adds the `Project` node, whether `rewriteExistentialExpr` returns an existence join or not. In the case when `rewriteExistentialExpr` does not return an existence join, `RemoveNoopOperators` will remove the unneeded `Project` node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis query returns an extraneous boolean column when run in spark-sql:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view t1(a) as values (1), (2), (3), (7);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t2(c1) as values (1), (2), (3);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t3(col1) as values (3), (9);\r\n\r\nselect *\r\nfrom t1\r\nwhere exists (\r\n  select c1\r\n  from t2\r\n  where a = c1\r\n  or a in (select col1 from t3)\r\n);\r\n\r\n1\tfalse\r\n2\tfalse\r\n3\ttrue\r\n```\r\n(Note: the above query will not have the extraneous boolean column when run from the Dataset API. That is because the Dataset API truncates the rows based on the schema of the analyzed plan. The bug occurs during optimization).\r\n\r\nThis query fails when run in either spark-sql or using the Dataset API:\r\n```\r\nselect (\r\n  select *\r\n  from t1\r\n  where exists (\r\n    select c1\r\n    from t2\r\n    where a = c1\r\n    or a in (select col1 from t3)\r\n  )\r\n  limit 1\r\n)\r\nfrom range(1);\r\n\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: Expects 1 field, but got 2; something went wrong in analysis\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, except for the removal of the extraneous boolean flag and the fix to the error condition.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCleaning up the semantics of init and zero value to the following. This also helps define what an \"invalid\" metric is.\r\n\r\ninitValue is the starting value for a SQLMetric. If a metric has value equal to its initValue, then it can/should be filtered out before aggregating with SQLMetrics.stringValue().\r\n \r\nzeroValue defines the lowest value considered valid. If a SQLMetric is invalid, it is set to zeroValue upon receiving any updates, and it also reports zeroValue as its value to avoid exposing it to the user programatically (concern previouosly addressed in [SPARK-41442](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41442)).\r\n\r\nFor many SQLMetrics, we use initValue = -1 and zeroValue = 0 to indicate that the metric is by default invalid. Whenever an invalid metric is updated, it sets itself to zeroValue and becomes valid. Invalid metrics will be filtered out when calculating min, max, etc. as a workaround for [SPARK-11013](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11013).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe semantics of initValue and _zeroValue in SQLMetrics is a little bit confusing, since they effectively mean the same thing. Changing it to the following would be clearer, especially in terms of defining what an \"invalid\" metric is.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This shouldn't change any behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove `protobuf` from required package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`protobuf` is automatically installed when installing `grpcio` and `grpcio-status`, so we don't need to specify the specific version explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo API changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe existing CI should pass\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a back-port of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44193.\r\n\r\nIn `RewritePredicateSubquery`, prune existence flags from the final join when `rewriteExistentialExpr` returns an existence join. This change prunes the flags (attributes with the name \"exists\") by adding a `Project` node.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nJoin LeftSemi, ((a#13 = c1#15) OR exists#19)\r\n:- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#19), (a#13 = col1#17)\r\n:  :- LocalRelation [a#13]\r\n:  +- LocalRelation [col1#17]\r\n+- LocalRelation [c1#15]\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\nProject [a#13]\r\n+- Join LeftSemi, ((a#13 = c1#15) OR exists#19)\r\n   :- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#19), (a#13 = col1#17)\r\n   :  :- LocalRelation [a#13]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [col1#17]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [c1#15]\r\n```\r\nThis change always adds the `Project` node, whether `rewriteExistentialExpr` returns an existence join or not. In the case when `rewriteExistentialExpr` does not return an existence join, `RemoveNoopOperators` will remove the unneeded `Project` node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis query returns an extraneous boolean column when run in spark-sql:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view t1(a) as values (1), (2), (3), (7);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t2(c1) as values (1), (2), (3);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t3(col1) as values (3), (9);\r\n\r\nselect *\r\nfrom t1\r\nwhere exists (\r\n  select c1\r\n  from t2\r\n  where a = c1\r\n  or a in (select col1 from t3)\r\n);\r\n\r\n1\tfalse\r\n2\tfalse\r\n3\ttrue\r\n```\r\n(Note: the above query will not have the extraneous boolean column when run from the Dataset API. That is because the Dataset API truncates the rows based on the schema of the analyzed plan. The bug occurs during optimization).\r\n\r\nThis query fails when run in either spark-sql or using the Dataset API:\r\n```\r\nselect (\r\n  select *\r\n  from t1\r\n  where exists (\r\n    select c1\r\n    from t2\r\n    where a = c1\r\n    or a in (select col1 from t3)\r\n  )\r\n  limit 1\r\n)\r\nfrom range(1);\r\n\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: Expects 1 field, but got 2; something went wrong in analysis\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, except for the removal of the extraneous boolean flag and the fix to the error condition.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-06T23:49:01Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T15:45:11Z","closed_at":"2023-12-07T03:23:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0c7a3b08c3e478ab374a7691436bfd78effcfaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44219/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44219/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44219/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aa271b09748532c804e60dcee7e8c0783bee1717","head":{"label":"bersprockets:schema_change_br34","ref":"schema_change_br34","sha":"aa271b09748532c804e60dcee7e8c0783bee1717","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to show a summary of workers in MasterPage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough `Alive Workers` is a useful information, it's insufficient to analyze the whole cluster status because we don't know how many workers are in other status. Especially, this is useful during the recovery process of Spark Master HA setting.\r\n\r\nIn short, this helps the users identify the issues intuitively.\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Alive Workers: 1\r\n+ Workers: 1 Alive, 1 Dead, 0 Decommissioned, 0 Unknown\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 3 13

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates the `writer` method in the Python data source API from\r\n```\r\ndef writer(self, schema: StructType, saveMode: str)\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\ndef writer(self, schema: StructType, overwrite: bool)\r\n```\r\nThe motivation here is that `saveMode` offers four modes: append, overwrite, error, and ignore, but practically speaking, only append and overwrite are meaningful. Also, DSv2 only supports the append and overwrite mode. Python data sources should be consistent.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make the API simpler.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a back-port of #44193.\r\n\r\nIn `RewritePredicateSubquery`, prune existence flags from the final join when `rewriteExistentialExpr` returns an existence join. This change prunes the flags (attributes with the name \"exists\") by adding a `Project` node.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nJoin LeftSemi, ((a#13 = c1#15) OR exists#19)\r\n:- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#19), (a#13 = col1#17)\r\n:  :- LocalRelation [a#13]\r\n:  +- LocalRelation [col1#17]\r\n+- LocalRelation [c1#15]\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\nProject [a#13]\r\n+- Join LeftSemi, ((a#13 = c1#15) OR exists#19)\r\n   :- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#19), (a#13 = col1#17)\r\n   :  :- LocalRelation [a#13]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [col1#17]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [c1#15]\r\n```\r\nThis change always adds the `Project` node, whether `rewriteExistentialExpr` returns an existence join or not. In the case when `rewriteExistentialExpr` does not return an existence join, `RemoveNoopOperators` will remove the unneeded `Project` node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis query returns an extraneous boolean column when run in spark-sql:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view t1(a) as values (1), (2), (3), (7);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t2(c1) as values (1), (2), (3);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t3(col1) as values (3), (9);\r\n\r\nselect *\r\nfrom t1\r\nwhere exists (\r\n  select c1\r\n  from t2\r\n  where a = c1\r\n  or a in (select col1 from t3)\r\n);\r\n\r\n1\tfalse\r\n2\tfalse\r\n3\ttrue\r\n```\r\n(Note: the above query will not have the extraneous boolean column when run from the Dataset API. That is because the Dataset API truncates the rows based on the schema of the analyzed plan. The bug occurs during optimization).\r\n\r\nThis query fails when run in either spark-sql or using the Dataset API:\r\n```\r\nselect (\r\n  select *\r\n  from t1\r\n  where exists (\r\n    select c1\r\n    from t2\r\n    where a = c1\r\n    or a in (select col1 from t3)\r\n  )\r\n  limit 1\r\n)\r\nfrom range(1);\r\n\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: Expects 1 field, but got 2; something went wrong in analysis\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, except for the removal of the extraneous boolean flag and the fix to the error condition.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-06T20:37:40Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T15:45:06Z","closed_at":"2023-12-06T23:25:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5adf30f3a58035c5430c65c94fa02610c81b08b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8129b97c99bb5363b1f042bac3ae21810ef43b60","head":{"label":"bersprockets:schema_change_br35","ref":"schema_change_br35","sha":"8129b97c99bb5363b1f042bac3ae21810ef43b60","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis updates the the behavior of `from_protobuf()` built function when underlying record fails to deserialize. \r\n\r\n  * **Current behvior**: \r\n    * By default, this would throw an error and the query fails. [This part is not changed in the PR] \r\n    * When `mode` is set to 'PERMISSIVE' it returns a non-null struct with each of the inner fields set to null e.g. `{ \"field_a\": null, \"field_b\": null }`  etc.\r\n       * This is not very convenient to the users. They don't know if this was due to malformed record or if the input itself has null. It is very hard to check for each field for null in SQL query (imagine a sql query with a struct that has 10 fields).\r\n      \r\n  * **New behavior**\r\n    * When `mode` is set to 'PERMISSIVE' it simply returns `null`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis makes it easier for users to detect and handle malformed records.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, but this does not change the contract. In fact, it clarifies it. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Unit tests are updated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-06T19:03:58Z","updated_at":"2023-12-08T16:37:19Z","closed_at":"2023-12-08T07:40:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4fe3aee1dff04e4177eb7695463f1f8c40060470","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db4bb07c0362fb9a8a4ed401fe07e33635eb7c86","head":{"label":"rangadi:protobuf-null","ref":"protobuf-null","sha":"db4bb07c0362fb9a8a4ed401fe07e33635eb7c86","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235638810,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU2Mzg4MTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"rangadi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/spark","description":"Apache

While the changes includes upgrading AWS SDK and KCL to v2, we will not \r\nupgrade KPL because it has not yet been migrated to SDKv2.\r\n\r\n* Parent Jira: parent Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44124. \r\n* Previous PR to setup Kinesis tests in Github Actions: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43736\r\n* Previous stale PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42581\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs the GA of AWS SDK v2, the SDKv1 has entered maintenance mode where its future \r\nrelease are only limited to address critical bug and security issues. More details about the SDK maintenance policy can be found here. To keep Spark’s dependent softwares up to date, we should consider upgrading the SDK to v2.\r\nThese changes could keep Spark Kinesis connector up to date, and enable users to\r\nreceive continuous support from the above libraries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. With this change, the Spark Kinesis connector will no longer work with SDKv1. \r\nAny applications that are running with previous version of Spark Kinesis connector\r\n would require update before migrating to Spark 4.0.\r\n\r\nAWS SDKv2 and KCLv2 contain several major changes\r\nthat are not backward compatible with their previous versions. And some public classes\r\nin the module (i.e. KinesisInputDStream) are using one of these breaking changes. Thus\r\nthese user-facing classes require updates as well.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n*  \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter the merge of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43736, the master branch began testing the `streaming-kinesis-asl` module. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, because the daily test will reuse `build_and_test.yml`, the daily test of branch-3.x also began testing `streaming-kinesis-asl`. \r\n\r\nHowever, in branch-3.x, the env `ENABLE_KINESIS_TESTS` is hard-coded as 1 in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new script, `check_pyspark_custom_errors.py`, integrated into the `dev/lint-python` process. This script is designed to enforce the use of PySpark's custom error classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the consistency of errors generated from PySpark systematically.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. It is a development tool enhancement to ensure code quality and consistency in error handling within the PySpark codebase.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `lint-python` script will detect the exact location where PySpark custom error is not used and generate the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(pyspark-dev-env) haejoon.lee@NQ679Q495F spark % ./dev/lint-python\r\nstarting python compilation test...\r\npython compilation succeeded.\r\n\r\nstarting black test...\r\nblack checks passed.\r\n\r\nstarting PySpark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the creation of a standalone documentation page for the DataFrame API in PySpark, renaming the existing \"Spark SQL\" to \"SQL\" to avoid misreading.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe DataFrame API is a fundamental and highly utilized component in PySpark, warranting its own dedicated space in the documentation. This separation enhances the visibility and accessibility of DataFrame API information, making it easier for users to find and understand.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but previously the DataFrame API content was nested under the Spark SQL section. This change will involve relocating and structuring the DataFrame API documentation as a distinct, top-level category in the PySpark API reference as below:\r\n\r\n## Before (Main page)\r\n\r\n<img

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd an extension called \"ExecutedPlanPrepRule\" to SparkSessionExtensions, which would allow developers to add their own rules(Rule[SparkPlan]) between `plannerStrategy` and executedPlan preparation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe need to add some \"Rule[SparkPlan]\"s at this position because currently, all such rules are present in AQE, which requires users to use AQE and meet the requirements to enter AdaptiveSparkPlanExec. This makes it difficult to implement certain extensions for simple SQLs.\r\n\r\nFor example, adding some new datasource filters for external data sources is challenging. Modifying DataSourceStrategy directly is not conducive to staying in sync with future advancements in the community. Additionally, customizing the Strategy makes it difficult to append new functionalities in an incremental manner. If we define AQE rules, they would not be effective for the simplest 'SELECT * FROM ... WHERE ...' statements. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a customizable Rule[SparkPlan] between sparkPlan and executedPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nunit test\r\nSparkSessionExtensionSuite#test(\"SPARK-46240: Support inject executed plan prep rules in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `RewritePredicateSubquery`, prune existence flags from the final join when `rewriteExistentialExpr` returns an existence join. This change prunes the flags (attributes with the name \"exists\") by adding a `Project` node.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nJoin LeftSemi, ((a#13 = c1#15) OR exists#19)\r\n:- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#19), (a#13 = col1#17)\r\n:  :- LocalRelation [a#13]\r\n:  +- LocalRelation [col1#17]\r\n+- LocalRelation [c1#15]\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\nProject [a#13]\r\n+- Join LeftSemi, ((a#13 = c1#15) OR exists#19)\r\n   :- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#19), (a#13 = col1#17)\r\n   :  :- LocalRelation [a#13]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [col1#17]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [c1#15]\r\n```\r\nThis change always adds the `Project` node, whether `rewriteExistentialExpr` returns an existence join or not. In the case when `rewriteExistentialExpr` does not return an existence join, `RemoveNoopOperators` will remove the unneeded `Project` node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis query returns an extraneous boolean column when run in spark-sql:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view t1(a) as values (1), (2), (3), (7);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t2(c1) as values (1), (2), (3);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t3(col1) as values (3), (9);\r\n\r\nselect *\r\nfrom t1\r\nwhere exists (\r\n  select c1\r\n  from t2\r\n  where a = c1\r\n  or a in (select col1 from t3)\r\n);\r\n\r\n1\tfalse\r\n2\tfalse\r\n3\ttrue\r\n```\r\n(Note: the above query will not have the extraneous boolean column when run from the Dataset API. That is because the Dataset API truncates the rows based on the schema of the analyzed plan. The bug occurs during optimization).\r\n\r\nThis query fails when run in either spark-sql or using the Dataset API:\r\n```\r\nselect (\r\n  select *\r\n  from t1\r\n  where exists (\r\n    select c1\r\n    from t2\r\n    where a = c1\r\n    or a in (select col1 from t3)\r\n  )\r\n  limit 1\r\n)\r\nfrom range(1);\r\n\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: Expects 1 field, but got 2; something went wrong in analysis\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, except for the removal of the extraneous boolean flag and the fix to the error condition.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-05T23:34:52Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T15:44:56Z","closed_at":"2023-12-06T18:55:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd5ecf758ab35d1882a54f9aa0a05747b1990a81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2222ed20059040cc5810c40f92454915ab861823","head":{"label":"bersprockets:schema_change","ref":"schema_change","sha":"2222ed20059040cc5810c40f92454915ab861823","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR uses java14 `instanceof` to replace the java8 `instanceof`.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nif (obj instanceof String) {\r\n    String s = (String) obj;    // grr...\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe can change it to\r\n```\r\nif (obj instanceof String s) {\r\n    // Let pattern matching do the work!\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsing [`[JEP 394: Pattern Matching for instanceof]` ](https://openjdk.org/jeps/394)can bring the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. **More concise syntax**: Pattern matching allows the desired \"shape\" of an object to be expressed concisely (the pattern), and for various statements and expressions to test that \"shape\" against their input (the matching).\r\n\r\n2. **Safer**: The motto is: \"A pattern variable is in scope where it has definitely matched\". This allows for the safe reuse of pattern variables and is both intuitive and familiar, since Java developers are already used to flow sensitive analyses.\r\n\r\n3. **Avoid explicit casts**: The use of pattern matching in instanceof should significantly reduce the overall number of explicit casts in Java programs. Type test patterns are particularly useful when writing equality methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-05T12:34:46Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T12:15:31Z","closed_at":"2023-12-06T18:59:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3bbd922ae2357fff644de8c3f85e280e7934f654","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA previous commit - d9c5f9d6 - updated the response of the\r\n`AddArtifact` RPC to return the session id. Further, it also added\r\nan assertion to the client of this RPC asserting that the session id\r\nreturned by the server matches the session id that was requested.\r\n\r\nHowever, we will have the case that a connect client with this new\r\nassertion included may connect to a Spark cluster that does not yet\r\nhave this change, making the change backwards incompatible.\r\n\r\nLoosen the assertion to allow empty session id in the RPC's response. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNewer connect clients can connect with older Spark clusters.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually started the a connect cluster using `spark-connect-shell`\r\nand using the connect client shell via `spark-connect-scala-client`.\r\nChanged the service to not return session id and verified the fix.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-05T09:37:01Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T16:43:56Z","closed_at":"2023-12-05T16:43:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34e7b60ead391eee41f7431d56c398ee1d9b1774","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47f1063071aa6a31b954afc68b876262930fe19c","head":{"label":"nija-at:artifact-sessionid","ref":"artifact-sessionid","sha":"47f1063071aa6a31b954afc68b876262930fe19c","user":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":590063058,"node_id":"R_kgDOIyul0g","name":"spark","full_name":"nija-at/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the current Spark code, there are some use cases of `SeqOps.view` and `ArrayOps.view`. In Spark 3.x, in order to be compatible with both Scala 2.12 and 2.13, `.toSeq` was added to these cases for type compatibility, but this also caused the lazy characteristic of `.view` to become invalid with Scala 2.13. This PR handles these cases as follows:\r\n\r\n1. For the cases in `UIUtils`, `StructType`, and `CompactibleFileStreamLog`, replace `.view` with `to(LazyList)` and remove the `.toSeq` conversion to restore their Lazy behavior.\r\n2. For other cases, after confirmation, directly remove the `.view` conversion.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up unnecessary `SeqOps.view` and `ArrayOps.view` conversions\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

np.left_shift(psdf, 1)\r\n   A\r\n0  2\r\n1  4\r\n2  6\r\n3  8\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this just enables the test case.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing CI especially `NumPyCompatTests` should pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add appropriate link for error class usage documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current [Usage of Contributing Error and Exception documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/development/contributing.html#usage) is lack of information where users exactly can search the existing error classes, and also where users can add a new error classes. We should add an appropriate link to make the documentation clearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but this improves the usability of error class usage documentation:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"724\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 12 25 32 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/df9f80e2-2f99-413c-aca2-0e8634440a46\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n<img width=\"712\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 12 24 25 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/bba6d43f-bf85-4e3b-86ea-df9bad4634a6\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade Derby from 10.14.2.0 to 10.16.1.1：\r\n\r\n1. The version in `pom.xml` and related comments were updated. After the update, Spark added a dependency on the `org.apache.derby:derbyshared` module because it is a cascading dependency of `derby`.\r\n2. Since `org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver` has been moved to the `org.apache.derby:derbytools` module, the corresponding dependency was added to the project.\r\n3. Since `org.apache.derby.jdbc.AutoloadedDriver` has been moved to `org.apache.derby.iapi.jdbc.AutoloadedDriver`, the corresponding test configuration in `o.a.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.CliSuite` was modified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDerby 10.16 release family [supports Java 17](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-7137) and higher with JDBC 4.2, and this version [no longer supports the Java SecurityManager](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-7138).\r\n\r\nThe full release notes as follows:\r\n- https://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10_16_1_1.cgi\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes the following two changes:\r\n- The `withColumns` message is now stackable. This means that stacked `withColumns` calls can now be represented by a single message. This should reduce the chance of hitting protobuf recursion limits.\r\n- Resolution of `withColumns` calls is moved into the analyzer. This should make resolving stacked withColumns call significantly faster.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is fairly common to stack withColumns calls on top of each other (e.g. when computing stats for all columns in a Dataframe). In connect plans with large withColumns chains tend to hit the protobuf recursion limit quickly. On top of this building a dataframe in these cases is rather small because each withColumns call creates a new server DataFrame.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests. I have added \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-12-04T17:57:58Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T00:17:59Z","closed_at":"2024-03-26T00:17:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d18ef335fbc97fc46ef6bf02d11c9df055a312d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1a6ac53170524f0a4777738633e06c7592e13ab","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-46225","ref":"SPARK-46225","sha":"a1a6ac53170524f0a4777738633e06c7592e13ab","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to fix the MERGE INSERT/UPDATE * behavior to make it easier to use, and also to make it consistent with the INSERT BY NAME behavior.\r\n\r\nToday, MERGE INSERT/UPDATE * requires the source table to have a superset of columns of the target table. But it's OK to skip updating the column if it doesn't exist in the source table. e.g. the source table has columns `a, b` and the target table has columns `a, b, c`. UPDATE * should be the same as `UPDATE target.a = source.a, target.b = source.b`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make the MERGE behavior more reasonable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now some MERGE queries can work while they failed before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nupdated tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

is a cherry-pick from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44006 to spark 3.3\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds a check for overflows when creating Parquet row group filters on an INT32 (byte/short/int) parquet type to avoid incorrectly skipping row groups if the predicate value doesn't fit in an INT. This can happen if the read schema is specified as LONG, e.g via `.schema(\"col LONG\")`\r\nWhile the Parquet readers don't support reading INT32 into a LONG, the overflow can lead to row groups being incorrectly skipped, bypassing the reader altogether and producing incorrect results instead of failing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReading a parquet file containing INT32 values with a read schema specified as LONG can produce incorrect results today:\r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nwill return an empty result. The correct result is either:\r\n- Failing the query if the parquet reader doesn't support upcasting integers to longs (all parquet readers in Spark today)\r\n- Return result `[0]` if the parquet reader supports that upcast (no readers in Spark as of now, but I'm looking into adding this capability).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe following: \r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nproduces an (incorrect) empty result before this change. After this change, the read will fail, raising an error about the unsupported conversion from INT to LONG in the parquet reader.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `ParquetFilterSuite` to ensure that no row group filter is created when the predicate value overflows or when the value type isn't compatible with the parquet type\r\n- Added test to `ParquetQuerySuite` covering the correctness issue described above.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-04T08:48:45Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T20:51:51Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T20:51:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6134c921fd389e78800c20f0d2be295aa2d0f5fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44156/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44156/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44156/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c8851c4c457af7320924d4ef02a0aed20cc626b","head":{"label":"johanl-db:SPARK-46092-row-group-skipping-overflow-3.3","ref":"SPARK-46092-row-group-skipping-overflow-3.3","sha":"4c8851c4c457af7320924d4ef02a0aed20cc626b","user":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":556757623,"node_id":"R_kgDOIS9ydw","name":"spark","full_name":"johanl-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db/spark","description":"Apache

is a cherry-pick from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44006 to spark 3.4\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds a check for overflows when creating Parquet row group filters on an INT32 (byte/short/int) parquet type to avoid incorrectly skipping row groups if the predicate value doesn't fit in an INT. This can happen if the read schema is specified as LONG, e.g via `.schema(\"col LONG\")`\r\nWhile the Parquet readers don't support reading INT32 into a LONG, the overflow can lead to row groups being incorrectly skipped, bypassing the reader altogether and producing incorrect results instead of failing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReading a parquet file containing INT32 values with a read schema specified as LONG can produce incorrect results today:\r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nwill return an empty result. The correct result is either:\r\n- Failing the query if the parquet reader doesn't support upcasting integers to longs (all parquet readers in Spark today)\r\n- Return result `[0]` if the parquet reader supports that upcast (no readers in Spark as of now, but I'm looking into adding this capability).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe following: \r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nproduces an (incorrect) empty result before this change. After this change, the read will fail, raising an error about the unsupported conversion from INT to LONG in the parquet reader.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `ParquetFilterSuite` to ensure that no row group filter is created when the predicate value overflows or when the value type isn't compatible with the parquet type\r\n- Added test to `ParquetQuerySuite` covering the correctness issue described above.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-04T08:48:37Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T17:00:10Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T17:00:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50606f481cab0be1077b368a8febf67cf0db3563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ac686f6a15c6a8a19af578513619863c0c16f04a","head":{"label":"johanl-db:SPARK-46092-row-group-skipping-overflow-3.4","ref":"SPARK-46092-row-group-skipping-overflow-3.4","sha":"ac686f6a15c6a8a19af578513619863c0c16f04a","user":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":556757623,"node_id":"R_kgDOIS9ydw","name":"spark","full_name":"johanl-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db/spark","description":"Apache

is a cherry-pick from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44006 to spark 3.5\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds a check for overflows when creating Parquet row group filters on an INT32 (byte/short/int) parquet type to avoid incorrectly skipping row groups if the predicate value doesn't fit in an INT. This can happen if the read schema is specified as LONG, e.g via `.schema(\"col LONG\")`\r\nWhile the Parquet readers don't support reading INT32 into a LONG, the overflow can lead to row groups being incorrectly skipped, bypassing the reader altogether and producing incorrect results instead of failing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReading a parquet file containing INT32 values with a read schema specified as LONG can produce incorrect results today:\r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nwill return an empty result. The correct result is either:\r\n- Failing the query if the parquet reader doesn't support upcasting integers to longs (all parquet readers in Spark today)\r\n- Return result `[0]` if the parquet reader supports that upcast (no readers in Spark as of now, but I'm looking into adding this capability).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe following: \r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nproduces an (incorrect) empty result before this change. After this change, the read will fail, raising an error about the unsupported conversion from INT to LONG in the parquet reader.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `ParquetFilterSuite` to ensure that no row group filter is created when the predicate value overflows or when the value type isn't compatible with the parquet type\r\n- Added test to `ParquetQuerySuite` covering the correctness issue described above.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-04T08:48:30Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T16:58:37Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T16:58:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b16b949bf2e44079419f49a0f0285e19b870056b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6bdf008a4896e6bb7cea672794ea2a9ef8f40a40","head":{"label":"johanl-db:SPARK-46092-row-group-skipping-overflow-3.5","ref":"SPARK-46092-row-group-skipping-overflow-3.5","sha":"6bdf008a4896e6bb7cea672794ea2a9ef8f40a40","user":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":556757623,"node_id":"R_kgDOIS9ydw","name":"spark","full_name":"johanl-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen I test `HiveDDLSuite` with\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"hive/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveDDLSuite\" -Phive\r\n```\r\nThis test throws an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - SPARK-34261: Avoid side effect if create exists temporary function *** FAILED *** (4 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   java.util.NoSuchElementException: key not

org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveDDLSuite.$anonfun$new$444(HiveDDLSuite.scala:3267)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI manually printed the content of `spark.sparkContext.addedJars`, which is an empty `Map`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I execute\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"hive/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.SQLQuerySuite org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveDDLSuite\" -Phive\r\n```\r\nAll tests pass, and the content of `spark.sparkContext.addedJars` is\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap(default -> Map(spark://localhost:54875/jars/SPARK-21101-1.0.jar -> 1701676986594, spark://localhost:54875/jars/hive-contrib-2.3.9.jar -> 1701676944590, spark://localhost:54875/jars/TestUDTF.jar -> 1701676921340))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason why this failure is not reproduced in the GitHub Action test is because `SQLQuerySuite` is indeed executed before `HiveDDLSuite`.\r\n\r\nSo in the current PR, I change to use `.get(\"default\").foreach(_.remove(k))` that the remove operation is only performed when `.get(\"default\")` is not `None`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake `HiveDDLSuite` independently testable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n- Manual check `HiveDDLSuite` with this pr and all test passed\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-04T08:26:56Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T16:53:30Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T16:52:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33ce9595ef93ef66c4e57693b525f719408e797e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44153/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44153/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44153/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47e164e14178105a5d126fc31cc79f90903bf021","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:HiveDDLSuite","ref":"HiveDDLSuite","sha":"47e164e14178105a5d126fc31cc79f90903bf021","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror
