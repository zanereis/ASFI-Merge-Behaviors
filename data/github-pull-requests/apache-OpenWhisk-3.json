client after get `StartClient` message.\r\n* After created akka grpc client, ActivationClientProxy sends `ClientCreationCompleted` to FunctionPullContainerProxy.\r\n* FunctionPullContainerProxy goto(ClientCreated) FSM state and sends `RequestActivation` to ActivationClientProxy\r\n* ActivationClientProxy actor fetches activationMessage from scheduler side's MemroyQueue using akka grpc after got RequestActivation message.\r\n* ActivationClientProxy actor forwards the activationMessage to FunctionPullContainerProxy,\r\n* FunctionPullContainerProxy initializes/runs the activationMessage.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThis module records container creation using a `CreationId`, when a new container creation request is created, one entry with an unique `CreationId` will be created and saved in to ETCD, and will be deleted when creation is finished(or timeout waiting for creation complete ack).\r\n\r\nSo that a `MemoryQueue` can query how many containers are being created from ETCD and then do containers scheduling based on this value.\r\n\r\nIt can also help to trace/debug the procedure of a container creation.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please

activations are not persistent.\r\nBut it could be improved in the future by taking a similar approach with what Kafka does.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nManage New scheduler's invokerServer. provide basic disable/enable for the invoker.\r\n\r\nThese http endpoints are for deployment or get the invoker's current situation, nomally, when do zerodowntime deployment,\r\nneed to send /disable request to invoker, make the invoker's status to `down`, then, the new activations will not be sent to the invoker, we can wait the invoker executed all flying activations, then, we can stop the invoker safely and deploy the invoker .\r\n\r\n* /disable\r\n  e.g. curl -X POST -u xxx:xxx http://$invoker:12001/disable, disabled the invoker, the invoker status will be changed to `unhealthy` firstly and changed to`down` finally after several seconds.\r\n* /enable\r\n  e.g. curl -X POST -u xxx:xxx http://$invoker:12001/enable, enable the invoker, the invoker status will be changed to `up` again.\r\n\r\n* /memory (this is for FPCInvokerServer only)\r\n  e.g. curl -X GET -u xxx:xxx http://$invoker:12001/memory, if the result >0, the invoker is busy, otherwise, it is idle.\r\n\r\nDue to simple, no document.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include

for https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5097\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis change allows selecting custom Load Balancing strategies based on the annotation of the action. I introduced the new MuxBalancer. When action is created, a developer can specify \"activationStrategy\" annotation. If OpenWhisk is configured to use MuxBalancer, it will pick up the annotation value and will look in the map of the configured activation strategies for that alias. In case if the alias is found, it will delegate the publishing of the activation to the LoadBalancer corresponding to the alias. Otherwise, MuxBalancer will use the \"default\" Load Balancer to delegate the publication.\r\n\r\nThe configuration of the MuxBalancer looks like folloving:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk.loadbalancer {\r\n    strategy {\r\n      default = \"fully.qualified.class.name.for. LoadBalancer0\"\r\n      custom = {\r\n           \"activationStrategyName1\" = \"fully.qualified.class.name.for. LoadBalancer1\"\r\n           \"activationStrategyName2\" = \"fully.qualified.class.name.for. LoadBalancer2\"\r\n            ...\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\na developer would use it in the following way:\r\n`wsk action create hello hello.js --annotation activationStrategy activationStrategyName1`\r\n\r\n### Breaking change?\r\nIt is not a breaking change, because the support for activation strategy annotation would be enabled only if  MuxBalancer is selected as a default Load Balancer. And only in that case, the `strategy` node of the configuration needs to be configured. Otherwise, system does not use it.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [x] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

-> \"Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://pre-commit.com/\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nUsing a `pre-commit` framework speeds up development as a lot of tests can be run on the local machine giving instant feedback. So we don't have to wait for the CI / GitHub actions to run to get feedback. The pre-commit automatically fixes some of the issues when you do `git commit` and if there are any issues the tests are marked as `red` failed and the commit fails. Then you will need to commit again so that all the tests pass `green`.\r\n\r\nThere are many more pre-commit checks listed here -> https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html\r\n\r\nLets get this PR merged and then I will look at adding more pre-commit tests 👍\r\n\r\nThe next image shows some of the final pre-commit run for all files -> running on my local machine:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"896\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-03-11 at 11 35 30 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/418747/110723013-145bda00-825f-11eb-9632-ea1b26f4b7ed.png\">\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

apache/openwhisk#5060\r\n\r\nFor any new features which uses Akka actors it would makes sense to start using Behavior-based construction of actors with the [Akka Typed](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/from-classic.html). This is the way to construct actors encouraged by Akka for any new functionality. In order to use Akka Typed, it should be supported by the Akka version used in OpenWhisk. At the same time no changes needed to the Akka Classic actors. Upgrading to the newest Akka version would allow to use all latest features of the Akka, while keeping it compatible with almost everything of the Akka 2.5.x that is been used in OpenWhisk so far.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n- [x] got rid of implicit custom ActorMaterializer \r\n- [x] upgraded to Akka Http 10.2.3 \r\n- [x] changed the way how Https set up when host name verification is disabled \r\n- [x] changed RestartSink.withBackoff to accept RestartSettings \r\n- [x] changed akka.actor.FSM.setTimer => akka.actor.FSM.startTimerAtFixedRate \r\n- [x] changed akka.actor.Scheduler.schedule => akka.actor.Scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate \r\n- [x] updated to the new signature of Source.actorRef \r\n- [x] replaced deprecated HttpResponse.copy\r\n- [x] replaced Gzip with Coders.Gzip\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [x] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [x] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [x] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

share same kafka instance using different prefix topic,\r\nBTW, userEvent is special, user may want to send some zones's event to same topic, so added extra prefix for it, user can decide whether want to send the event to same topic or different topic.\r\n\r\nI tested in my local env\r\n* Default configuration (all topics's prefix is empty string), topics name as

Description\r\n\r\nThe invoker will now drop healthcheck activations read from kafka that are older than a configurable threshold. The default is 30 minutes. The max backlog of healthcheck activations backlogged in the invoker topics that will be processed are therefore # controllers * number of minutes threshold since each controller sends a healthcheck once per minute when unhealthy. The invoker also will no longer become healthy prior to eating through these old messages and processing a young enough healthcheck message at which point should be the end of the kafka backlog and safe to mark the invoker as healthy.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#5053 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n-

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe invoker health supervisor, on startup, eagerly went into the health state without confirming the test action was actually successful. This happens at startup, when the ring buffer is not yet primed. The patch herein adjusts the health protocol for the priming phase and stays unhealth/unresponsive if the test action failed.\r\n\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] There is an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4988)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [x] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nIn kubenetes env,  if runtime pod number is big and `akka.coordinated-shutdown.phases.actor-system-terminate_timeout` is low(e.g default value is `30 s`), this may lead to `the runtime pods are not deleted completely after execute helm delete/uninstall xxx`, because when timeout happens, the `cleanup` is not executed finished.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, need to increase relative timeout value, it is better to make these timeout value configurable.\r\n\r\nAnother brother pr: https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube/pull/653\r\n\r\n## Related issue and

the version in the path annotation.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the ES activation store can't search for activations by the name without version.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd also, all other components that generate activation don't store version, but only InvokerReactive stores the version in the path annotation. It must be consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/a1ba98778e3db80a06fe707c47c5f4c05d8b85ee/core/controller/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/controller/actions/PrimitiveActions.scala#L589\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/a1ba98778e3db80a06fe707c47c5f4c05d8b85ee/core/invoker/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/containerpool/ContainerProxy.scala#L1070\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/8759cadeea6101a3693aac1d34d4069f516d5558/core/controller/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/controller/actions/SequenceActions.scala#L243\r\n\r\n\r\n####

Description\r\nThis allows the operator to specifically set the instanceId for a unique name in zookeeper from the command line when starting the invoker. Added a comment that this command option should not be used unless you are sure that the invokerId does not exist for any unique name\r\n\r\nFor context, we use hostname for our invoker unique names. We have hosts that no longer exist and therefore invokers are created backfilled in the controller invoker pool for those invokers that will never be started again. This causes the invoker hashing algorithm to be off since these invokers are always considered down. This change allows us to easily move our highest lexicographical invokers into those slots in zookeeper without manually going into zookeeper to do so.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I

-->\r\nAlong with CPU it seems reasonable action developers may need more disk as their actions use more and more memory.
