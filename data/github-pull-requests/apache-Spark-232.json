What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`global_temp` is used as a database name to access global temp views. The current catalog lookup logic considers only the first element of multi-part name when it resolves a catalog. This results in using the session catalog even `global_temp` is used as a table name under v2 catalog. This PR addresses this by making sure multi-part name has two elements before using the session catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis cr includes a new api so that users of the V2 Datasource api can specify an action to take when a user types in the 'Vacuum {table}' command.  This is commonly used to remove deleted records and optimize the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere is currently no way for users to create this type of behavior in SQL\r\n\r\n> vacuum is a very common command. for example .\r\n>\r\n> - https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html\r\n> - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-vacuum.html\r\n> -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDepend on type coercion when building the replace query. This would solve an edge case where when trying to replace `NaN`s, `0`s would get replace too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis Scala code snippet:\r\n```\r\nimport scala.math;\r\n\r\nprintln(Double.NaN.toLong)\r\n```\r\nreturns `0` which is problematic as if you run the following Spark code, `0`s get replaced as well:\r\n```\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1.0, 0), (0.0, 3), (float('nan'), 0)], (\"index\", \"value\"))\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|index|value|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|  1.0|    0|\r\n|  0.0|    3|\r\n|  NaN|    0|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n>>> df.replace(float('nan'), 2).show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|index|value|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|  1.0|    2|\r\n|  0.0|    3|\r\n|  2.0|    2|\r\n+-----+-----+ \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the PR, running the same above code snippet returns the correct expected results:\r\n```\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1.0, 0), (0.0, 3), (float('nan'), 0)], (\"index\", \"value\"))\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|index|value|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|  1.0|    0|\r\n|  0.0|    3|\r\n|  NaN|    0|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n>>> df.replace(float('nan'), 2).show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|index|value|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|  1.0|    0|\r\n|  0.0|    3|\r\n|  2.0|    0|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\nAnd additionally, query results are changed as a result of the change in depending on scala's type coercion rules.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

working at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26644 I've noticed something strange in behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26644 focusses on merging UserDefinedTypes into Spark's native types. Delta checks if the schema is still compatible, so as an integration test I tried to union two DF's, where one has a UserDefinedTypes, which should then be merged into a native type. To mimic this, I've used an union there, because we don't have the Delta extension, and Spark does not check schema compatibility on write, so it is impossible to reproduce the situation that we've observed with Delta.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Delta checks compatibility, it merges the schema using the `StructType.merge()`, and when Spark checks compatibility, it uses the `TypeCoercion`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/CheckAnalysis.scala#L314-L323\r\n\r\nSince this is complex code, I think we should merge these two to get similar behavior. Curious what your opinion is on this, and why these so similar functions are kept separately.\r\n\r\nhttps://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30103\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemoving the `StructType.merge()`, and use `TypeCoercion.findTightestCommonType()` instead. The one in TypeCoercion looks more complete.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we propose to use the value of `spark.sql.source.default` as the provider for `CREATE TABLE` syntax instead of `hive` in Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\nAnd to help the migration, we introduce a legacy conf `spark.sql.legacy.respectHiveDefaultProvider.enabled` and set its default to `false`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Currently, `CREATE TABLE` syntax use hive provider to create table while `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable` API using the value of `spark.sql.source.default` as a provider to create table. It would be better to make them consistent.\r\n\r\n2. User may gets confused in some cases. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT) USING PARQUET;\r\nCREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these two DDLs, use may think that `t2` should also use parquet as default provider since Spark always advertise parquet as the default format. However, it's hive in this case.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we omit the USING clause in a CTAS statement, we do pick parquet by default if `spark.sql.hive.convertCATS=true`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t3 USING PARQUET AS SELECT 1 AS VALUE;\r\nCREATE TABLE t4 AS SELECT 1 AS VALUE;\r\n```\r\nAnd these two cases together can be really confusing.\r\n\r\n3. Now, Spark SQL is very independent and popular. We do not need to be fully consistent with Hive's behavior. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, before this PR, using `CREATE TABLE` syntax will use hive provider. But now, it use the value of `spark.sql.source.default` as its provider.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded tests in `DDLParserSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using `writeStream` we always have to use `format(\"xxx\")` in order to target the selected sink while in `readStream` you can use directly e.g `.parquet` \r\n\r\nBasically this is to add the support to the core writers for writeStream\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n \r\n```\r\nwriteStream\r\n.outputMode(\"append\")\r\n.partitionBy(\"id\")\r\n.options(options)\r\n.parquet(path)\r\n ```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed to maintain same syntax between `write` and `writeStream` just like `read` and `readStream` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt adds a new way of calling the sinks when using `writeStream`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFor now I just added a test for the `parquet` sink\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-02T08:04:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T02:29:38Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T12:49:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1760d17e81dd9aff2c2f53644b7bf9c2e1cffbd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe patch adds scaladoc on `HDFSMetadataLog.serialize` and `HDFSMetadataLog.deserialize` for adding implementation note when overriding - HDFSMetadataLog calls `serialize` and `deserialize` inside try-finally and caller will do the resource (input stream, output stream) cleanup, so resource cleanup should not be performed in these methods, but there's no note on this (only code comment, not scaladoc) which is easy to be missed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nContributors who are unfamiliar with the intention seem to think it as a bug if the resource is not cleaned up in serialize/deserialize of subclass of HDFSMetadataLog, and they couldn't know about the intention without reading the code of HDFSMetadataLog. Adding the note as scaladoc would expand the visibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJust a doc change.","created_at":"2019-12-02T04:54:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T22:42:53Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T15:01:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c70235808cd7cf9247edccd18d0cf646c3b04a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/410c666bce4ca75d590f7d4e7201d0b892f2faff","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:MINOR-SS-HDFSMetadataLog-serde-scaladoc","ref":"MINOR-SS-HDFSMetadataLog-serde-scaladoc","sha":"410c666bce4ca75d590f7d4e7201d0b892f2faff","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change properly documents the `mergeSchema` option directly in the Python APIs for reading Parquet data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe docstring for `DataFrameReader.parquet()` mentions `mergeSchema` but doesn't show it in the API. It seems like a simple oversight.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, you'd have to do this to use `mergeSchema`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.read.option('mergeSchema', True).parquet('test-parquet').show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, you can use the option as (I believe) it was intended to be used:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.read.parquet('test-parquet', mergeSchema=True).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR changes the signatures of `DataFrameReader.parquet()` and `DataStreamReader.parquet()` to match their docstrings.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTesting the `mergeSchema` option directly seems to be left to the Scala side of the codebase. I tested my change manually to confirm the API works.\r\n\r\nI also confirmed that setting `spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema` at the session does not get overridden by leaving `mergeSchema` at its default when calling `parquet()`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema', True)\r\n>>> spark.range(3).write.parquet('test-parquet/id')\r\n>>> spark.range(3).withColumnRenamed('id', 'name').write.parquet('test-parquet/name')\r\n>>> spark.read.option('recursiveFileLookup', True).parquet('test-parquet').show()\r\n+----+----+\r\n|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove some classes extending Scala collections into parallel source trees, to support 2.13; other minor collection-related modifications.\r\n\r\nModify some classes extending Scala collections to work with 2.13 as well as 2.12. In many cases, this means introducing parallel source trees, as the type hierarchy changed in ways that one class can't support both.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support building for Scala 2.13 in the future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThere should be no behavior change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. Note that the 2.13 changes are not tested by the PR builder, of course. They compile in 2.13 but can't even be tested locally. Later, once the project can be compiled for 2.13, thus tested, it's possible the 2.13 implementations will need updates.","created_at":"2019-12-01T18:54:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T19:05:43Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T16:59:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e774e8f6c62d01933551f7ed298c65f36f804a75","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

needed?\r\nAdaptive execution try to  convert `SortMergeJoin` to `BroadcastJoin` by checking the `dataSize` metrics of spark plan. However, if the spark plan generates empty result, the `dataSize` metrics is empty due to `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.metric.SQLMetrics`'s initial value is -1, which could lead to the following

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a note to the docs README showing how to get Jekyll to automatically pick up changes to the Python API docs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`jekyll serve --watch` doesn't watch for changes to the API docs. Without the technique documented in this note, or something equivalent, developers have to manually retrigger a Jekyll build any time they update the Python API docs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested this PR manually by making changes to Python docstrings and confirming that Jekyll automatically picks them up and serves them locally.","created_at":"2019-11-30T01:30:14Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T00:17:28Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T23:31:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44b371b8df1014061cd82b32925b90a5800cb262","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627011,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MDEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCUMENTATION","name":"DOCUMENTATION","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/05eb1b33bc84e0f580e9759fa0c1e7ae5aa8564d","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-30084-watch-api-docs","ref":"SPARK-30084-watch-api-docs","sha":"05eb1b33bc84e0f580e9759fa0c1e7ae5aa8564d","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up to #24830, this PR adds the `recursiveFileLookup` option to the Python DataFrameReader API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR maintains Python feature parity with Scala.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, you'd only be able to use this option as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.read.option(\"recursiveFileLookup\", True).text(\"test-data\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, you can reference the option from within the format-specific method:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.read.text(\"test-data\", recursiveFileLookup=True).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis option now also shows up in the Python API docs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested this manually by creating the following directories with dummy data:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest-data\r\n├── 1.txt\r\n└── nested\r\n   └── 2.txt\r\ntest-parquet\r\n├── nested\r\n│  ├── _SUCCESS\r\n│  ├── part-00000-...-.parquet\r\n├── _SUCCESS\r\n├── part-00000-...-.parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then ran the following tests and confirmed the output looked good:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.read.parquet(\"test-parquet\", recursiveFileLookup=True).show()\r\nspark.read.text(\"test-data\", recursiveFileLookup=True).show()\r\nspark.read.csv(\"test-data\", recursiveFileLookup=True).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n`python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_readwriter.py` seems pretty sparse. I'm happy to add my tests there, though it seems we have been deferring testing like this to the Scala side of things.","created_at":"2019-11-29T18:51:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T01:19:59Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T01:10:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d95546ab7f4194755f46984dad2077817be23ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26718/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26718/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26718/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/72f33da4d17e9e48336fcf2cb2f98fa5e6138484","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-27990-recursiveFileLookup-python","ref":"SPARK-27990-recursiveFileLookup-python","sha":"72f33da4d17e9e48336fcf2cb2f98fa5e6138484","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd CreateTempViewUsingStatement and make CREARE TEMPORARY VIEW go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. \r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. When running CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW USING ...,  Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the view name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nunit tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-29T18:46:11Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T04:02:27Z","closed_at":"2019-12-10T04:02:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c8fb84274af94871edd778eb0bc9167fa931c0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/074309d2e4c3766c02b36bfa1677d073507aa6b8","head":{"label":"huaxingao:spark-30077","ref":"spark-30077","sha":"074309d2e4c3766c02b36bfa1677d073507aa6b8","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently we only clean up the local directories on application removed. However, when executors die and restart repeatedly, many temp files are left untouched in the local directories, which is undesired behavior and could cause disk space used up gradually. Especially, in long running service like Spark thrift-server with dynamic resource allocation disabled, it's very easy causes local disk full.\r\n#21390 fixed the same problem on Standalone mode. On YARN, this issue still exists.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21390#issuecomment-391695376, YARN only cleans container local dirs when container (executor) is exited. But these files are not in container local dirs.\r\n<img width=\"1527\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-29 at 4 52 56 PM\"

the container dirs when the executor is running in YARN container.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd an UT and manually test.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-29T08:58:20Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T11:13:00Z","closed_at":"2020-06-26T00:24:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7b79b8e04a26ff3dee53536208ac214d97f77ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apache Spark PR Builder is using `hive-1.2` for `hadoop-2.7` and `hive-2.3` for `hadoop-3.2`. This PR aims to support\r\n\r\n- `[test-hive1.2]`  in PR builder\r\n- `[test-hive2.3]` in PR builder to be consistent and independent of the default profile\r\n- After this PR, all PR builders will use Hive 2.3 by default (because Spark uses Hive 2.3 by default as of https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/c98e5eb3396a6db92f2420e743afa9ddff319ca2)\r\n- Use default profile in AppVeyor build.\r\n\r\nNote that this was reverted due to unexpected test failure at `ThriftServerPageSuite`, which was investigated in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26706 . This PR fixed it by letting it use their own forked JVM. There is no explicit evidence for this fix and it was just my speculation, and thankfully it fixed at least.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis new tag allows us more flexibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo. (This is a dev-only change.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCheck the Jenkins triggers in this PR.\r\n\r\nDefault:\r\n\r\n```\r\n========================================================================\r\nBuilding

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bug on ArrayKeyIndexType.hashCode() as it is simply calling Array.hashCode() which in turn calls Object.hashCode(). That should be Arrays.hashCode() to reflect the elements in the array.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI've encountered the bug in #25811 while adding test codes for #25811, and I've split the fix into individual PR to speed up reviewing. Without this patch, ArrayKeyIndexType would bring various issues when it's used as type of collections.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've skipped adding UT as ArrayKeyIndexType is in test and the patch is pretty simple one-liner.","created_at":"2019-11-29T07:08:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T22:43:05Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T15:06:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db0445f10bb303d08182ecedc46d21e913eaab37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a74f0635cdb77df908e256bed1d950c4100c2a3","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-30075","ref":"SPARK-30075","sha":"7a74f0635cdb77df908e256bed1d950c4100c2a3","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes subquery planning by calling the planner and plan preparation rules on the subquery plan directly. Before we were creating a `QueryExecution` instance for subqueries to get the executedPlan. This would re-run analysis and optimization on the subqueries plan. Running the analysis again on an optimized query plan can have unwanted consequences, as some rules, for example `DecimalPrecision`, are not idempotent.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider the expression `1.7 * avg(a)` which after applying the `DecimalPrecision` rule becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\npromote_precision(1.7) * promote_precision(avg(a))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the optimization, more specifically the constant folding rule, this expression becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.7 * promote_precision(avg(a))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if we run the analyzer on this optimized query again, we will get:\r\n\r\n```\r\npromote_precision(1.7) * promote_precision(promote_precision(avg(a)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will later optimized as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.7 * promote_precision(promote_precision(avg(a)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, re-running the analysis and optimization on this expression results in an expression with extra nested promote_preceision nodes. Adding unneeded nodes to the plan is problematic because it can eliminate situations where we can reuse the plan. \r\n\r\nWe opted to introduce dedicated planners for subuqueries, instead of making the DecimalPrecision rule idempotent, because this eliminates this entire category of problems. Another benefit is that planning time for subqueries is reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-28T13:52:21Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:24:09Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T19:56:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6497ae1272639bec44dbaeac284e41b01cc09c76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec4cd2351f5e933829eb162135b0e9a34898b6c0","head":{"label":"dbaliafroozeh:CreateDedicatedPlannerForSubqueries","ref":"CreateDedicatedPlannerForSubqueries","sha":"ec4cd2351f5e933829eb162135b0e9a34898b6c0","user":{"login":"dbaliafroozeh","id":50329522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzI5NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50329522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":200818224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDA4MTgyMjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"dbaliafroozeh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbaliafroozeh","id":50329522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzI5NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50329522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces ANSI `OVERLAPS` predicate to SparkSQL. It yields true when two time periods (defined by their endpoints) overlap, false when they do not overlap.\r\nSyntaxes as bellow.\r\n```sql\r\n(start1, end1) OVERLAPS (start2, end2)\r\n(start1, length1) OVERLAPS (start2, length2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n /**\r\n * The operator `OVERLAPS` determines whether or not two chronological periods overlap in time. A\r\n * chronological period is specified by a pair of datetimes (starting and ending) or as a\r\n * starting datetime and an interval(resolved by analyzer to datetimes pairs early).\r\n *\r\n * If the length of the period is greater than 0, then the period consists of all points of time\r\n * greater than or equal to the lower endpoint, and less than the upper endpoint,\r\n * a.k.a [lower, upper).\r\n *\r\n * If the length of the period is equal to 0, then the period consists of a single point in time,\r\n * the lower endpoint, a.k.a [lower, lower].\r\n *\r\n * Two periods overlap if they have at least one point in common.\r\n *\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npostgres=# select (cast(a as timestamp), cast(b as timestamp)) overlaps (cast(c as timestamp), cast(d as timestamp)) from (values\r\n ('2011-11-11', '2011-11-11', '2011-11-11', '2011-11-11'),\r\n ('2011-11-10', '2011-11-11', '2011-11-11', '2011-11-12'),\r\n ('2011-11-11', '2011-11-10', '2011-11-11', '2011-11-12'),\r\n ('2011-11-11', '2011-11-10', '2011-11-12', '2011-11-11'),\r\n ('2011-11-10', '2011-11-11', '2011-11-12', '2011-11-13'),\r\n ('2011-11-10', '2011-11-20', '2011-11-11', '2011-11-19'),\r\n ('2011-11-11', '2011-11-19', '2011-11-10', '2011-11-20')) t(a,b,c,d);\r\n overlaps\r\n----------\r\n t\r\n f\r\n f\r\n f\r\n f\r\n t\r\n t\r\n(7 rows)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nANSI support FeatureID: F053, and better PostgreSQL feature parity too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, add a datetime predicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`DataFrameNaFunctions.drop` doesn't handle duplicate columns even when column names are not specified.\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nval left = Seq((\"1\", null), (\"3\", \"4\")).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\nval right = Seq((\"1\", \"2\"), (\"3\", null)).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\nval df = left.join(right, Seq(\"col1\"))\r\ndf.printSchema\r\ndf.na.drop(\"any\").show\r\n```\r\nproduces\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- col1: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: string (nullable = true)\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Reference 'col2' is ambiguous, could be: col2, col2.;\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.package$AttributeSeq.resolve(package.scala:240)\r\n```\r\nThe reason for the above failure is that columns are resolved by name and if there are multiple columns with the same name, it will fail due to ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `DataFrameNaFunctions.drop` such that if the columns to drop are not specified, it will resolve ambiguity gracefully by applying `drop` to all the eligible columns. (Note that if the user specifies the columns, it will still continue to fail due to ambiguity).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf column names are not specified, `drop` should not fail due to ambiguity since it should still be able to apply `drop` to the eligible columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now all the rows with nulls are dropped in the above example:\r\n```\r\nscala> df.na.drop(\"any\").show\r\n+----+----+----+\r\n|col1|col2|col2|\r\n+----+----+----+\r\n+----+----+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-28T06:07:47Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:24:08Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T04:25:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e4a9928bc2ceba3ce5c9a7d299f61c375090ee1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bbc885248338a53d69207b34101008cb59aabf56","head":{"label":"imback82:na_drop","ref":"na_drop","sha":"bbc885248338a53d69207b34101008cb59aabf56","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[HIVE-12063](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12063) improved pad decimal numbers with trailing zeros to the scale of the column. The following description is copied from the description of HIVE-12063.\r\n\r\n> HIVE-7373 was to address the problems of trimming tailing zeros by Hive, which caused many problems including treating 0.0, 0.00 and so on as 0, which has different precision/scale. Please refer to HIVE-7373 description. However, HIVE-7373 was reverted by HIVE-8745 while the underlying problems remained. HIVE-11835 was resolved recently to address one of the problems, where 0.0, 0.00, and so on cannot be read into decimal(1,1).\r\n However, HIVE-11835 didn't address the problem of showing as 0 in query result for any decimal values such as 0.0, 0.00, etc. This causes confusion as 0 and 0.0 have different precision/scale than 0.\r\nThe proposal here is to pad zeros for query result to the type's scale. This not only removes the confusion described above, but also aligns with many other DBs. Internal decimal number representation doesn't change, however.\r\n\r\n**Spark SQL**:\r\n```sql\r\n// bin/spark-sql\r\nspark-sql> select cast(1 as decimal(38, 18));\r\n1\r\nspark-sql>\r\n\r\n//

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the time window that locality wait times are measuring is the time since the last task launched for a TSM. The proposed change is to instead measure the time since this TSM's available slots were fully utilized.\r\n\r\nThe number of available slots for a TSM is determined by dividing all slots among the TSMs according to the scheduling policy (FIFO vs FAIR). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- cluster can become heavily underutilized as described in [SPARK-18886](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18886?jql=project%20%3D%20SPARK%20AND%20text%20~%20delay)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPoolSuite\r\nTaskSchedulerImplSuite\r\nTaskSetManagerSuite\r\n\r\nThoughts on this approach?\r\n@viirya \r\n@squito \r\n@kayousterhout

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis proposes to introduce a naming convention for Spark metrics configuration parameters used to enable/disable metrics source reporting using the Dropwizard metrics library:   `spark.metrics.sourceNameCamelCase.enabled` and update 2 parameters to use this naming convention.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark has a few parameters to enable/disable metrics reporting. Their naming pattern is not uniform and this can create confusion.  Currently we have:\r\n`spark.metrics.static.sources.enabled`  \r\n`spark.app.status.metrics.enabled`  \r\n`spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled`  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nUpdate parameters for enabling/disabling metrics reporting new in Spark 3.0: `spark.metrics.static.sources.enabled` -> `spark.metrics.staticSources.enabled`, `spark.app.status.metrics.enabled`  -> `spark.metrics.appStatusSource.enabled`. \r\nNote: `spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled` is left unchanged as it is already in use in Spark 2.x.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested","created_at":"2019-11-27T11:14:22Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T22:31:15Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T22:31:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d17385b7cc32fecbe53abe366327c9fe850c576e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to skip building test artifacts in `dev/make-distribution.sh`.\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.0.0, we need to build additional binary distribution, this helps the release process by speeding up building multiple binary distributions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince the generated binary artifacts are irrelevant to the test jars, we can skip this.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n$ time dev/make-distribution.sh\r\n      726.86 real      2526.04 user        45.63 sys\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\n$ time

use `-Phive-2.3`. This PR adds `hadoop-2.7/hive-1.2` distribution to provide a similar combination like `Apache Spark 2.4` line.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This is additional distribution which resembles to `Apache Spark 2.4` line in terms of `hive` version.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual. \r\n\r\nPlease note that we need a dry-run mode, but the AS-IS release script do not generate additional combinations including this in `dry-run` mode.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-27T02:04:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T00:32:38Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T23:56:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e339052765f801dd9fa46729d507e8031738018","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROJECT%20INFRA","name":"PROJECT

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis allows the configuration of the restart policy for drivers and executors running on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current restart policies are hard-coded to \"Never\". Restarting a failed application requires deleting and rescheduling all of its pods, which is very slow, requires external management, and drops any cache that exists in memory or container filesystem. The driver will still reschedule evicted executors.\r\n\r\nThere is also no way, with the current lack of sidecar support, to run a long-running streaming application with injected sidecar containers that need to restart on failure (sidecar containers will not affect the pod phase). This PR solves that by allowing streaming applications to set \"Always\" for all pods.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNew configuration properties `spark.kubernetes.driver.restartPolicy` and `spark.kubernetes.executor.restartPolicy` were added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI manually verified the changes worked and ran the test script. I didn't add unit tests because it didn't seem like the tests would prove anything useful. Should I? 🤷‍♂

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds Hive provider into table metadata in `HiveExternalCatalog.alterTableStats`. When we call `HiveClient.alterTable`, `alterTable` will erase if it can not find hive provider in given table metadata.\r\n\r\nRename table also has this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBecause running `ANALYZE TABLE` on a Hive table, if the table has bucketing info, will erase existing bucket info.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. After this PR, running `ANALYZE TABLE` on Hive table, won't erase existing bucketing info.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2019-11-26T21:49:56Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:23:17Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T05:40:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fc61a2e4ec093e95d89a230f92626ff45587628","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54572769684d51400de19bfd990786bae903971d","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-hive-bucket","ref":"fix-hive-bucket","sha":"54572769684d51400de19bfd990786bae903971d","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR makes `Analyzer.ResolveRelations` responsible for looking up both v1 and v2 tables from the session catalog and create an appropriate relation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently there are two issues:\r\n1. As described in [SPARK-29966](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29966), the logic for resolving relation can load a table twice, which is a perf regression (e.g., Hive metastore can be accessed twice).\r\n2. As described in [SPARK-30001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30001), if a catalog name is specified for v1 tables, the query fails:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"create table t using csv as select 1 as i\")\r\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from t\").show\r\n+---+\r\n|  i|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n+---+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from spark_catalog.t\").show\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Table or view not found: spark_catalog.t; line 1 pos 14;\r\n'Project [*]\r\n+- 'UnresolvedRelation [spark_catalog, t]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Now the catalog name is resolved correctly:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"create table t using csv as select 1 as i\")\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []                                       \r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from t\").show\r\n+---+\r\n|  i|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n+---+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from spark_catalog.t\").show\r\n+---+\r\n|  i|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new tests.","created_at":"2019-11-26T21:28:00Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T04:44:28Z","closed_at":"2019-12-06T07:45:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63af1c8716b232b442f4e4f9d706e93480a6bc0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23cc9d3894fe39f989ea7511433213dc44a60e5c","head":{"label":"imback82:resolve_relation","ref":"resolve_relation","sha":"23cc9d3894fe39f989ea7511433213dc44a60e5c","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is the second PR for the Stage Level Scheduling. This is adding in the necessary executor side changes:\r\n1) executors to know what ResourceProfile they should be using\r\n2) handle parsing the resource profile settings - these are not in the global configs\r\n3) then reporting back to the driver what resource profile it was started with.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds all the piping for YARN to pass the information all the way to executors, but it just uses the default ResourceProfile (which is the global applicatino level configs).\r\n\r\nAt a high level these changes include:\r\n1) adding a new --resourceProfileId option to the CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend\r\n2) Add the ResourceProfile settings to new internal confs that gets passed into the Executor\r\n3) Executor changes that use the resource profile id passed in to read the corresponding ResourceProfile confs and then parse those requests and discover resources as necessary\r\n4) Executor registers to Driver with the Resource profile id so that the ExecutorMonitor can track how many executor with each profile are running\r\n5) YARN side changes to show that passing the resource profile id and confs actually works. Just uses the DefaultResourceProfile for now.\r\n\r\nI also removed a check from the CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend that used to check to make sure there were task requirements before parsing any custom resource executor requests.  With the resource profiles this becomes much more expensive because we would then have to pass the task requests to each executor and the check was just a short cut and not really needed. It was much cleaner just to remove it.\r\n\r\nNote there were some changes to the ResourceProfile, ExecutorResourceRequests, and TaskResourceRequests in this PR as well because I discovered some issues with things not being immutable. That api now look like:\r\n\r\nval rpBuilder = new ResourceProfileBuilder()\r\nval ereq = new ExecutorResourceRequests()\r\nval treq = new TaskResourceRequests()\r\n\r\nereq.cores(2).memory(\"6g\").memoryOverhead(\"2g\").pysparkMemory(\"2g\").resource(\"gpu\", 2, \"/home/tgraves/getGpus\")\r\ntreq.cpus(2).resource(\"gpu\", 2)\r\n\r\nval resourceProfile = rpBuilder.require(ereq).require(treq).build\r\n\r\nThis makes is so that ResourceProfile is immutable and Spark can use it directly without worrying about the user changing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed for the executor to report which ResourceProfile they are using so that ultimately the dynamic allocation manager can use that information to know how many with a profile are running and how many more it needs to request.  Its also needed to get the resource profile confs to the executor so that it can run the appropriate discovery script if needed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nrefine the output of \"DESC TABLE\" command.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the output of \"DESC TABLE\" command is like below : \r\n\r\n```\r\nid

needed?\r\nCurrently, \"DESC TABLE\" will show reserved properties (eg. location, comment) in the \"Table Property\" section.\r\nSince reserved properties are different from common properties, displaying reserved properties together with other table detailed information and displaying other properties in single field should be reasonable, and it is consistent with hive and DescribeTableCommand action.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nyes, the output of \"DESC TABLE\" command is refined as above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate existing unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-26T09:38:42Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T23:21:15Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T15:17:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66dd6eaeaacf33a8e1faaab864956e69429c0633","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae1c1baf22f380970f5a96d50d6c56c76a4f0abd","head":{"label":"fuwhu:SPARK-29979-FOLLOWUP-1","ref":"SPARK-29979-FOLLOWUP-1","sha":"ae1c1baf22f380970f5a96d50d6c56c76a4f0abd","user":{"login":"fuwhu","id":12389745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu","html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42981239,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjk4MTIzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"fuwhu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fuwhu","id":12389745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu","html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-29894 provides information on the Codegen Stage Id in WEBUI for SQL Plan graphs. Similarly, this proposes to add Codegen Stage Id in the DAG visualization for Stage execution. DAGs for Stage execution are available in the WEBUI under the Jobs and Stages tabs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is proposed as an aid for drill-down analysis of complex SQL statement execution, as it is not always easy to match parts of the SQL Plan graph with the corresponding Stage DAG execution graph. Adding Codegen Stage Id for WholeStageCodegen operations makes this task easier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nStage DAG visualization in the WEBUI will show codegen stage id for WholeStageCodegen operations, as in the example snippet from the WEBUI, Jobs tab  (the query used in the example is TPCDS 2.4 q14a):\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12987461/Snippet_StagesDags_with_CodegenId%20_annotated.png)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested, see also example snippet.","created_at":"2019-11-26T08:50:51Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T17:01:06Z","closed_at":"2020-01-17T17:01:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71f2de287af122db9d744457c2cc97d229f9705b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 31c4fab (#23052) to make sure the partition calling `ManifestFileCommitProtocol.newTaskTempFile` creates actual file.\r\n\r\nThis also reverts part of commit 0d3d46d (#26639) since the commit fixes the issue raised from 31c4fab and we're reverting back. The reason of partial revert is that we found the UT be worth to keep as it is, preventing regression - given the UT can detect the issue on empty partition -> no actual file. This makes one more change to UT; moved intentionally to test both DSv1 and DSv2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter the changes in SPARK-26081 (commit 31c4fab / #23052), CSV/JSON/TEXT don't create actual file if the partition is empty. This optimization causes a problem in `ManifestFileCommitProtocol`: the API `newTaskTempFile` is called without actual file creation. Then `fs.getFileStatus` throws `FileNotFoundException` since the file is not created.\r\n\r\nSPARK-29999 (commit 0d3d46d / #26639) fixes the problem.

is introducing a new plugin interface for shuffle IO; currently,\r\nparts of that API provide lifecycle methods that are already covered by the\r\nplugin API that was added in SPARK-29396.\r\n\r\nThis change makes some modifications so that:\r\n\r\n- The driver and executor components of the shuffle plugin extend their\r\n  respective counterparts in the generic plugin API.\r\n- The shuffle IO plugin is managed by the same code that manages other\r\n  generic plugins.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies and reuses similar code that exists in both implementations,\r\nand also provides more functionality to shuffle plugins: not only do they have\r\nmore contextual information (without having to query APIs like SparkEnv) but\r\nthey also have access to other functionality in the plugin API that would\r\notherwise require touching internal Spark APIs.\r\n\r\nThere is a small change to the generic plugin API to avoid registering an\r\nRPC endpoint and starting threads when not needed; plugins now must explicitly\r\nsay they want to handle RPC messages for the endpoint to be created. This is\r\ndone because the default shuffle plugin is now loaded by the plugin system,\r\nand does not need the RPC functionality. (This API hasn't been released yet\r\nso it's ok to make the change.)\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that initialization of the SortShuffleManager in executors\r\nis a bit weird, because of the order in which things are initialized: the\r\nshuffle manager is initialized by SparkEnv, and plugin initialization happens\r\nafter that. In any case, all initialization is done before any tasks are\r\nallowed to run..\r\n\r\nCurrently, the shuffle plugin is always loaded, regardless of whether the sort\r\nshuffle manager is being used; this was already the case in the driver, but\r\nnow is also the case in the executors. It shouldn't be hard to fix that if\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nTested with existing and updated unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-26T00:32:18Z","updated_at":"2020-05-09T00:10:54Z","closed_at":"2020-05-09T00:10:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19919279ad99ea584eb19086866ee8644a33028b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n `SparkContext` should use `EVENT_LOG_COMPRESSION_CODEC` to get the right codec name for EventLogger.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#24921 added a new conf for EventLogger's compression codec. We should reflect this change into `SparkContext` as well. Though I didn't find any places that `SparkContext.eventLogCodec` really takes an effect, I think it'd be better to have it as a right value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe are now able to handle whitespaces for integral and fractional types, and the leading or trailing whitespaces for interval, date, and timestamps. But the current interval parser is not able to identify whitespaces as separates as PostgreSQL can do. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes the whitespaces handling be consistent for nterval values.\r\nTyped interval literal, multi-unit representation, and casting from strings are all supported.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npostgres=# select interval E'1 \\t day';\r\n interval\r\n----------\r\n 1 day\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\npostgres=# select interval E'1\\t' day;\r\n interval\r\n----------\r\n 1 day\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhitespace handling should be consistent for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Correctly release `ByteBuf` in `TransportCipher` in all cases\r\n- Move closing / releasing logic to `handlerRemoved(...)` so we are guaranteed that is always called.\r\n- Correctly release `frameBuf` it is not null when the handler is removed (and so also when the channel becomes inactive)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe need to carefully manage the ownership / lifecycle of `ByteBuf` instances so we don't leak any of these. We did not correctly do this in all cases:\r\n - when end up in invalid cipher state.\r\n - when partial data was received and the channel is closed before the full frame is decoded\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/9784.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the newly added

Previously, `-Phadoop-3.2` hid this `hive-storage-api` dependency. Now, we are using `-Phive-2.3` instead. As I mentioned [previously](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26619#issuecomment-556926064), this PR is required to compile `sql/core` module without `-Phive-2.3`.\r\n\r\n- For `sql/hive` and `sql/hive-thriftserver`, it's natural that we need `-Phive-1.2` or `-Phive-2.3`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis will pass the Jenkins (with the dependency check and unit tests).\r\n\r\nWe need to check manually with `./build/mvn -DskipTests --pl sql/core --am compile`.\r\n\r\nThis closes #26657

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe filter predicate for aggregate expression is an `ANSI SQL`.\r\n```\r\n<aggregate function> ::=\r\nCOUNT <left paren> <asterisk> <right paren> [ <filter clause> ]\r\n| <general set function> [ <filter clause> ]\r\n| <binary set function> [ <filter clause> ]\r\n| <ordered set function> [ <filter clause> ]\r\n| <array aggregate function> [ <filter clause> ]\r\n| <row pattern count function> [ <filter clause> ]\r\n```\r\nThere are some mainstream database support this syntax.\r\n**PostgreSQL:**\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-AGGREGATES\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  year,\r\n  count(*) FILTER (WHERE gdp_per_capita >= 40000)\r\nFROM\r\n  countries\r\nGROUP BY\r\n  year\r\n```\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  year,\r\n  code,\r\n  gdp_per_capita,\r\n  count(*) \r\n    FILTER (WHERE gdp_per_capita >= 40000) \r\n    OVER   (PARTITION BY year)\r\nFROM\r\n  countries\r\n```\r\n**jOOQ:**\r\nhttps://blog.jooq.org/2014/12/30/the-awesome-postgresql-9-4-sql2003-filter-clause-for-aggregate-functions/\r\n\r\n**Notice:**\r\n1.This PR only supports FILTER predicate without codegen. maropu will create another PR is related to SPARK-30027 to support codegen.\r\n2.This PR only supports FILTER predicate without DISTINCT. I will create another PR is related to SPARK-30276 to support this.\r\n3.This PR only supports FILTER predicate that can't reference the outer query. I created ticket SPARK-30219 to support it.\r\n4.This PR only supports FILTER predicate that can't use IN/EXISTS predicate sub-queries. I created ticket SPARK-30220 to support it.\r\n5.Spark SQL cannot supports a SQL with nested aggregate.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake separate source trees for Scala 2.12/2.13 in order to accommodate mutually-incompatible support for Ordering of double, float.\r\n\r\nNote: This isn't the last change that will need a split source tree for 2.13. But this particular change could go several ways:\r\n\r\n- (Split source tree)\r\n- Inline the Scala 2.12 implementation\r\n- Reflection\r\n\r\nFor this change alone any are possible, and splitting the source tree is a bit overkill. But if it will be necessary for other JIRAs (see umbrella SPARK-25075), then it might be the easiest way to implement this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nScala 2.13 split Ordering.Double into Ordering.Double.TotalOrdering and Ordering.Double.IeeeOrdering. Neither can be used in a single build that supports 2.12 and 2.13.\r\n\r\nTotalOrdering works like java.lang.Double.compare. IeeeOrdering works like Scala 2.12 Ordering.Double. They differ in how NaN is handled - compares always above other values? or always compares as 'false'? In theory they have different uses: TotalOrdering is important if floating-point values are sorted. IeeeOrdering behaves like 2.12 and JVM comparison operators.\r\n\r\nI chose TotalOrdering as I think we care more about stable sorting, and because elsewhere we rely on java.lang comparisons. It is also possible to support with two methods.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPending tests, will see if it obviously affects any sort order. We need to see if it changes NaN sort order.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests so far.","created_at":"2019-11-25T01:24:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T19:06:26Z","closed_at":"2019-11-26T16:26:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b04b7348244184ed364b0c4f16784838bb67ebab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

In the case \"The fragment ends at a position within this block\", the end of fragment should be before the end of block，where the \"end of block\" means `b.getOffset + b.getLength`，not

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn case you write a UDT, you always need to read it with the UDT registered. In many cases, you want to write it, and then convert it into a native DataType.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Delta or when appending a partition, you can write to the same table and then it needs to be able to convert merge the UDT into the native type again.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen appending data to the table, I get the exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to merge fields 'START_DATE_MAINTENANCE_FLPL' and 'START_DATE_MAINTENANCE_FLPL'.\r\nFailed to merge incompatible data types TimestampType and org.apache.spark.sql.types.CustomXMLGregorianCalendarType@5ff12345;;\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Add a unit test to the DataTypeSuite.scala\r\n* Add an integration test to UserDefinedTypeSuite.scala\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30004","created_at":"2019-11-23T15:59:45Z","updated_at":"2020-04-26T09:01:32Z","closed_at":"2020-04-17T00:10:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a67063472fea7803b402dddedb0cbfb7f19faf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26644/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26644/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26644/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dd3c913f0c552c975cd96cde554ba90f99b85bab","head":{"label":"Fokko:SPARK-30004","ref":"SPARK-30004","sha":"dd3c913f0c552c975cd96cde554ba90f99b85bab","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49888791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTg4ODc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"Fokko/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/spark","description":"Mirror
