fencing producers, we currently blindly bump the epoch by 1 and write an abort marker to the transaction log. If the log is unavailable (for example, because the number of in-sync replicas is less than min.in.sync.replicas), we will roll back the attempted write of the abort marker, but still increment the epoch in the transaction metadata cache. During periods of prolonged log unavailability, producer retires of InitProducerId calls can cause the epoch to be increased to the point of exhaustion, at which point further InitProducerId calls fail because the producer can no longer be fenced. With this patch, we track whenever we have failed to write the bumped epoch, and when that has happened, we don't bump the epoch any further when attempting to fence. This is safe because the in-memory epoch is still causes old producers to be fenced.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

[KAFKA-9668](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9668)\r\n\r\n`KafkaStreams.getAllMetadata()` returns `StreamsMetadataState.getAllMetadata()`. All the latter methods is `synchronized` it returns a reference to internal mutable state.  Not only does this break encapsulation, but it means any thread iterating over the returned collection when the metadata gets rebuilt will encounter a `ConcurrentModificationException`.\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n * switches from clearing and rebuild `allMetadata` when `onChange` is called to building a new list and swapping this in. This is thread safe and has the benefit that the returned list is not empty during a rebuild: you either get the old or the new list.\r\n * removes synchronisation from `getAllMetadata` and `getLocalMetadata`. These are returning member variables. Synchronisation adds nothing.\r\n * changes `getAllMetadata` to wrap its return value in an unmodifiable wrapper to avoid breaking encapsulation.\r\n * changes the getters in `StreamsMetadata` to wrap their return values in unmodifiable wrapper to avoid breaking encapsulation.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added to cover both changes classes to ensure encapsulation and thread-safety are maintained.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-05T22:24:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T12:57:06Z","closed_at":"2020-03-06T21:08:53Z","merged_at":"2020-03-06T21:08:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca90a8480183bf287d07baf6b3794bc51f76b89e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/51c76fedd9da8c27b667075d334dc8da9bed6489","head":{"label":"big-andy-coates:KAFKA-9668-ConcurrentMod","ref":"KAFKA-9668-ConcurrentMod","sha":"51c76fedd9da8c27b667075d334dc8da9bed6489","user":{"login":"big-andy-coates","id":8012398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTIzOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8012398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates","html_url":"https://github.com/big-andy-coates","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122472092,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjI0NzIwOTI=","name":"kafka","full_name":"big-andy-coates/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"big-andy-coates","id":8012398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTIzOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8012398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates","html_url":"https://github.com/big-andy-coates","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-andy-coates/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/big-andy-coates/kafka","description":"Mirror

(add-config) default user, user, or <user, client-id> quota and then removing it via delete-config does not update quota bound in ClientQuotaManager.Metrics for existing users or <user,client-id>. This causes brokers to continue to throttle with the previously set quotas until brokers restart (or <user,client> stops sending traffic for sometime and sensor expires). This happens only when removing the user or user,client-id where there are no more quotas  to fall back to. Common example where the issue happens: Initial no quota state --> add default user quota --> remove default user quota. \r\n\r\nThe cause of the issue was `DefaultQuotaCallback.quotaLimit` was returning `null` when no default user quota set, which caused `ClientQuotaManager.updateQuotaMetricConfigs` to skip updating the appropriate sensor, which left it unchanged with the previous quota. Since `null` is an acceptable return value for `ClientQuotaCallback.quotaLimit`, which is already treated as unlimited quota in other parts of the code, this PR ensures that `ClientQuotaManager.updateQuotaMetricConfigs` updates the quotas for which  `ClientQuotaCallback.quotaLimit` returns `null` to unlimited quota.\r\n\r\nAdded 3 unit tests that failed before the fix in the PR. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

[KAFKA-9667](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9667)\r\n\r\nThe Connect Json serde was recently enhanced to support serializing decimals as standard JSON numbers, (Original work done under [KAFKA-8595](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8595)), e.g. `1.23`.  However, there is a bug in the implementation: it's stripping trailing zeros!  `1.23` is not the same as `1.230`.  The first is a number accurate to 2 decimal places, where as the later is accurate to 3 dp.\r\n\r\nIt is important that trailing zeros are not dropped when de(serializing) decimals.  For some use-cases it may be acceptable to drop the trailing zeros, but for others it definitely is not.\r\n\r\n#### Current Functionality\r\nIf a JSON object was to contain the number `1.230` then the Java JsonDeserializer would correctly deserialize this into a `BigDecimal`. The BigDecimal would have a scale of 3, which is correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, if that same BigDecimal was then serialized back to JSON using the Java JsonSerializer it would incorrectly strip the zeros, serializing to `1.23`. \r\n\r\n#### Expected Functionality\r\nWhen serializing, trailing zeros should be maintained.  For example, a BigDecimal such as `1.230`, (3 dp), should be serialized as `1.230`. \r\n\r\n#### Compatibility\r\nBoth the old serialized number, e.g. `1.23`, and the proposed corrected serialized number, e.g. `1.230`, are valid JSON numbers. Downstream consumers should have no issue deserializing either.\r\n\r\nThis is not super urgent, but would be good to get into the next point releases of 2.4 and 2.5.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

KIP-447 we need to commit all tasks at once using eos-beta as all tasks share the same producer. Right now, each task is committed individually (by making multiple calls to `consumer.commitSync` or individual calls to `producer.commitTransaction` for the corresponding task producer).\r\n\r\nTo allow for a unified commit logic, we move the commit logic into `TaskManager`. For non-eos, we collect all offset to be committed and do a single call to `consumer.commitSync` -- for eos-alpha we still commit each transaction individually (but now triggered by the `TaskManager` to have all code in one place).\r\n\r\nTo allow for a unified commit logic, we need to split existing method on `Task` interface in pre/post parts to allow committing in between, in particular:\r\n\r\n - `commit()` -> `prepareCommit()` and `postCommit()`\r\n - `suspend()` -> `prepareSuspend()` and `suspend()` (we keep the name as it still does suspend the task)\r\n - `closeClean()` -> `prepareCloseClean()` and `closeClean(Map<TopicPartitions, Long> checkpoint)` (we keep the name as it still does close the task)\r\n - `closeDirty()` -> `prepareCloseDirty()` and `closeDirty()` (we keep the name as it still does close the task)\r\n\r\n`prepareCloseClean()` returns checkpoint information to allow checkpointing after the `TaskManager` did the commit within `closeClean()`.\r\n\r\nIn a follow up PR, we will introduce eso-beta and commit a single transaction over all task using the shared producer.\r\n\r\nCall for review @guozhangwang @abbccdda

AFTER KAFKA-9047\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9047, currently the listOffsets operation doesn't respect the configured retries and backoff for a given call. \r\n\r\nFor example, the code path could go like so:\r\n1) Make a metadata request and schedule subsequent list offsets calls\r\n2) Metadata error comes back with InvalidMetadataException\r\n\r\n3) Go back to 1\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the state is not preserved across calls. We loose the information regarding how many tries the call has been tried and how far out we should schedule the call to try again. This could lead to a tight retry loop and put pressure on the brokers.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\n\r\nUnit tests:\r\n1. Test if listOffsets can get the correct offsets for each partition after maxAllowedNumTries times of failed tries\r\n2. Test if listOffsets will timeout after maxAllowedNumTries + 1 times of failed tries\r\n3. Test if listOffsets will respect the retry backoff\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-04T02:40:29Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T21:17:22Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T21:16:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7049425c746d39eba0c2e97d977b94ade3e1d7f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8217/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8217/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8217/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c84ca2f043e9e348d5d1cfd8a0c35101fb362f92","head":{"label":"ctan888:KAFKA-9621","ref":"KAFKA-9621","sha":"c84ca2f043e9e348d5d1cfd8a0c35101fb362f92","user":{"login":"ctan888","id":31675100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc1MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31675100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888","html_url":"https://github.com/ctan888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241996119,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDE5OTYxMTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ctan888/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ctan888","id":31675100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc1MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31675100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888","html_url":"https://github.com/ctan888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ctan888/kafka","description":"Mirror

`incrementalAlterConfigs` API supports OpType.APPEND and OpType.SUBTRACT for configuration properties of LIST type. If an APPEND or SUBTRACT OpType is submitted for a config property which currently has no value, then the operation fails with a NullPointerException on the broker side (conveyed as an \"unknown server error\" to the client).\r\n\r\nThis is because the alter code does a `getProperty` of the existing configuration value\r\nwith no concern as to whether or not the property actually exists.\r\n\r\nThis change handles the case of existing null properties. \r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-----\r\nThis change includes 2 test cases in the unit test that demonstrate the issue for OpType.SUBTRACT and OpType.APPEND. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-04T01:47:47Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T01:20:34Z","closed_at":"2020-03-13T01:20:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5bb4f2d2c8ca8df284a1e262a209e2f8bb49e591","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/244caa24935aef29e36090ca55d52952611e605f","head":{"label":"steverod:steverod.kafka-9644","ref":"steverod.kafka-9644","sha":"244caa24935aef29e36090ca55d52952611e605f","user":{"login":"steverod","id":42848865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQ4ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42848865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod","html_url":"https://github.com/steverod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203641171,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDM2NDExNzE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"steverod/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steverod","id":42848865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQ4ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42848865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod","html_url":"https://github.com/steverod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steverod/kafka","description":"Mirror

think the root cause of KAFKA-8893, KAFKA-8894, KAFKA-8895 and KSTREAMS-3779 are the same: some intermediate topics are not deleted in the `setup` logic before recreating the user topics, which could cause the waitForDeletion (that check exact match of all existing topics) to fail, and also could cause more records to be returned because of the intermediate topics that are not deleted from the previous test case.\r\n\r\nAlso inspired by https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5418/files I used a longer timeout (120 secs) for deleting all topics.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

what/why\r\nthe `throttling_test` was broken by this PR (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7785) since it depends on the consumer having partitions-assigned before starting the producer\r\n\r\nthis PR provides the ability to wait for partitions to be assigned in the console consumer before considering it started. \r\n\r\n### caveat\r\nthis does not support starting up the JmxTool inside the console-consumer for custom metrics while using this `wait_until_partitions_assigned` flag since the code assumes one JmxTool running per node.\r\n\r\nI think a proper fix for this would be to make `JmxTool` its own standalone single-node service\r\n\r\n## alternatives\r\nwe could use the `EndToEnd` test suite which uses the verifiable producer/consumer under the hood but I found that there were more changes necessary to get this working unfortunately (specifically doesn't seem like this test suite plays nicely with the `ProducerPerformanceService`)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-28T21:03:05Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T23:39:27Z","closed_at":"2020-03-01T00:43:52Z","merged_at":"2020-03-01T00:43:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"72a5aa8b0758f23b42c6e4453d6dc6c4861aa1ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/78b03eb5b9fb4fc4f19a58dd163cf31585d6ee97","head":{"label":"brianbushree:throttle-test-fix","ref":"throttle-test-fix","sha":"78b03eb5b9fb4fc4f19a58dd163cf31585d6ee97","user":{"login":"brianbushree","id":21266602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY2NjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21266602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree","html_url":"https://github.com/brianbushree","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165895774,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU4OTU3NzQ=","name":"kafka","full_name":"brianbushree/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brianbushree","id":21266602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY2NjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21266602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree","html_url":"https://github.com/brianbushree","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianbushree/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brianbushree/kafka","description":"Mirror

test_throttled_reassignment test fails because the consumer that is used to validate reassignment does not start on time to consume all messages. This does not seem like an issue with the throttling of the reassignment, since increasing the timeout allowed the test to pass multiple consecutive runs locally.\r\n\r\nThis test seemed to rely on the default JmxTool for the console consumer that was removed in this commit: 179d0d7\r\nThe console consumer would check to see if it had partitions assigned to it before beginning to consume. Although the test occasionally failed with the JmxTool, it began to fail much more after the removal.\r\n\r\nError messages of failures followed the below format with varying numbers of missed messages. They are the first messages by the producer.\r\n\r\n535 acked message did not make it to the Consumer. They are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19...plus 515 more. Total Acked: 192792, Total Consumed: 192259. We validated that the first 535 of these missing messages correctly made it into Kafka's data files. This suggests they were lost on their way to the consumer.\r\nIn the scope of the test, this error suggests that the test is falling into the race condition described in produce_consume_validate.py, which has the timeout to prevent the consumer from missing initial messages.\r\n\r\nThis can serve as a temporary fix until the logic of consumer startup is addressed

`test_throttled_reassignment` test fails because the consumer that is used to validate reassignment does not start on time to consume all messages. This does not seem like an issue with the throttling of the reassignment, since increasing the timeout allowed the test to pass multiple consecutive runs locally.\r\n\r\nThis test seemed to rely on the default JmxTool for the console consumer that was removed in this commit: https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/179d0d73d65ab2c3eb8bc79c70b9893f07038447#diff-70247099943a55f682e6e6e4f400334eL69\r\nThe console consumer would check to see if it had partitions assigned to it before beginning to consume. Although the test occasionally failed with the JmxTool, it began to fail much more after the removal.\r\n\r\nError messages of failures followed the below format with varying numbers of missed messages. They are the first messages by the producer.\r\n```\r\n535 acked message did not make it to the Consumer. They are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19...plus 515 more. Total Acked: 192792, Total Consumed: 192259. We validated that the first 535 of these missing messages correctly made it into Kafka's data files. This suggests they were lost on their way to the consumer.\r\n```\r\nIn the scope of the test, this error suggests that the test is falling into the race condition described in `produce_consume_validate.py`, which has the timeout to prevent the consumer from missing initial messages.\r\n\r\nThis can serve as a temporary fix until the logic of consumer startup is addressed further.","created_at":"2020-02-27T17:54:42Z","updated_at":"2020-02-27T22:36:42Z","closed_at":"2020-02-27T22:36:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59c2b66ad3ca5fe33435add439781e2502cc4452","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/962584f0c7ce2a25b7d83d5e23c7ace340b00559","head":{"label":"mattwong949:2.4-throttle","ref":"2.4-throttle","sha":"962584f0c7ce2a25b7d83d5e23c7ace340b00559","user":{"login":"mattwong949","id":16786722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzg2NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16786722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949","html_url":"https://github.com/mattwong949","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":243061625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDMwNjE2MjU=","name":"kafka","full_name":"mattwong949/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattwong949","id":16786722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzg2NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16786722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949","html_url":"https://github.com/mattwong949","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwong949/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattwong949/kafka","description":"Mirror

detailed description of your change**\r\n\r\nBroker side: Added an Info level log when throwing the offsetOutOfRangeException in log.scala. Also, utilized a new error class OffsetOutOfRangeExceptionWithOffsetValues, a subclass of OffsetOutOfRangeException, as a media to pass offset values into the response to the consumer client.\r\n\r\nClient side: Added an Info level log when the fetcher gets OffsetOutOfRangeExceptionWithOffsetValues, which is the subclass of OffsetOutOfRangeException.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)**\r\n\r\nI changed the source code and deliberately threw offsetOutOfRangeException on the broker side. Then, I started the kafka console producer & consumer and receives:\r\n\r\n`INFO [Log partition=test-0, dir=/tmp/kafka-logs] Received request for offset 0 for partition test-0, but we only have log segments in the range 0 to 40.
