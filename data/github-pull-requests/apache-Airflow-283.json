title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2634\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up for AIRFLOW-2534, removing impyla from dependencies since it's never used now.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo additional test, since it's just a dependency fix. I confirmed that the existent tests passed and HiveServer2Hook worked well with PyHive instead of impyla.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following issues: [this one](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2633) and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* Removed templating from overrides param in AWSBatchOperator due to issues templating ints. Ints must be allowed to e.g. allow the user to specify memory and vcpus for an AWS Batch Job. Right now, the inability to put ints in a templated field prohibits this. \r\n\r\n* Fixed control flow issue with the exponential backoff method of querying batch job for success. Previously, wouldn't quit until it hit max retries. Just had to change an `or` to an `and`!\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n* Two one line changes which are obvious in and of themselves. Additionally hard to write a test to submit a Batch job since you need AWS creds. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2630\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nA TestCase for SqlSensor is named  as HttpSensorTests for some reason, so fixed it\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo additional test since it's a fix for the test itself and really trivial.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

enable the ability to set up non-blocking and soft-fail sensors.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1786) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs referenced Jira-ticket states that timed out sensor in soft-fail mode will fail the overall DAG run, although the expected behavior is to mark it as skipped. Also, there was added an ability to set up non-blocking AND soft-fail sensors (the same way as it works for regular sensors). Non-blocking means here that sensors do not occupy the slot during waiting for the resource. Instead, using `retries` and `retry_delay` and relatively small value for `timeout` one can set up a lot of long waiting sensors without wasting executor slots.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: tests/sensors/test_base_sensor.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-15T02:58:45Z","updated_at":"2018-06-17T19:48:47Z","closed_at":"2018-06-17T19:48:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e89f5cdb8547e9a61f9699a9782d0bc88ccd63ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8f5cca209b3ea27ca1eee8d000fbc50f6a293ead","head":{"label":"artem-kirillov:AIRFLOW-1786","ref":"AIRFLOW-1786","sha":"8f5cca209b3ea27ca1eee8d000fbc50f6a293ead","user":{"login":"artem-kirillov","id":971710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MTcxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/971710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov","html_url":"https://github.com/artem-kirillov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137281472,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcyODE0NzI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"artem-kirillov/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"artem-kirillov","id":971710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MTcxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/971710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov","html_url":"https://github.com/artem-kirillov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-kirillov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/artem-kirillov/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

add DAG skip logging\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2613\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen Airflow was populating a DagBag from a .zip file, if a single\r\nfile in the root directory did not contain the strings 'airflow' and\r\n'DAG' it would ignore the entire .zip file.\r\n\r\nAlso added a small amount of logging to not bombard user with info\r\nabout skipping their .py files.\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdds a file in the test_zip where a .py file does not contain \"airflow\" nor \"DAG\". This checks to make sure the entire .zip is not skipped over.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-2310\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently, there is no integration with AWS Glue Jobs. My pull request is basically an improvement to integrate running AWS Glue jobs with Airflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded tests.contrib.test_aws_glue_job_hook.py.\r\nHowever, moto the test class for boto3 does not support AWS Glue mock currently\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2612\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\ntests/operators/hive_operator.py has test cases\r\ncalled HiveServer2Test and HivePrestoTest,\r\nwhich are disabled by default.\r\nThis PR enables the former as the first step\r\nto improve test coverage for Hive-related\r\nhooks and operators.\r\n\r\nHiveServer2Test had the following tests:\r\n\r\n- test_select_conn, test_multi_statements, test_to_csv, test_select_conn_with_schema, test_get_results_with_schema, test_get_records_with_schema, test_get_pandas_df_with_schema: moved to TestHiveServer2Hook in tests/hooks/test_hive_hook.py since they were tests for HiveServer2Hook\r\n- test_get_metastore_databases: removed since it was a test for HiveMetastoreHook and TestHiveMetastoreHook in tests/hooks/test_hive_hook.py already has a similar test called test_get_partitions\r\n- connect_mock: removed since it was unused\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the tests described above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

I think the priority of pvc should higher than git-sync, so I\r\nthink when dags_volume_claim is been set, the mountPath shuold not join the git_subpath.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2608) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR adds custom exceptions for the APIs, so that we can handle different kind of exceptions efficiently. We can also use these custom exceptions to add the default static message for each exceptions instead of adding that repeatedly in the code. This also helps standardize the status code of each exception. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

behavior: When you Branch from A  e.g. the BranchPythonOperator '->' (B or C,), and you make some B '->' C as well. The current behavior is that C will be skipped even though it's a downstream task of B.\r\nTo avoid this behavior this fix will check that only tasks which are not in the downstream of the branch are skipped. I think using this behavior the BranchyPythonOperator is more useful and behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2609\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nNo UI Changes description as above\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSame tests should apply\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2594\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: Implicit commits release locks in some parts of TI execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit tests cover stuff. Will add a test to check for commits.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n@yrqls21

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2512 GoogleCloudBaseHook using deprecated oauth2client\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-2522 Cannot use GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to authenticate for GCP connections\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* Updates the GCP hooks to use the google-auth library and removes\r\n  dependencies on the deprecated oauth2client package.\r\n* Removes inconsistent handling of the scope parameter for different\r\n  auth methods.\r\n\r\nNote: using google-auth for credentials requires a newer version of the\r\ngoogle-api-python-client package, so this commit also updates the\r\nminimum version for that.\r\n\r\nTo avoid some annoying warnings about the discovery cache not being\r\nsupported, so disable the discovery cache explicitly as recommend here:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/44518587/101923\r\n\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded `test_gcp_api_base_hook.py` to test fix for [AIRFLOW-2522] (allowing scopes for default credentials).\r\n\r\nTested by running:\r\n\r\n    nosetests tests/contrib/operators/test_dataflow_operator.py \\\r\n        tests/contrib/operators/test_gcs*.py \\\r\n        tests/contrib/operators/test_mlengine_*.py \\\r\n        tests/contrib/operators/test_pubsub_operator.py \\\r\n        tests/contrib/hooks/test_gcp*.py \\\r\n        tests/contrib/hooks/test_gcs_hook.py \\\r\n        tests/contrib/hooks/test_bigquery_hook.py\r\n\r\nand also tested by running some GCP-related DAGs locally, such as the\r\nDataproc DAG example at\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/quickstart\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nTweaked explanation of default credentials since they can be many different kinds of credentials besides those from the `gcloud` command.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2587\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes MySqlToHiveTransfer to map\r\nMySQL TIMESTAMP to Hive TIMESTAMP\r\n(not STRING) so that users are not\r\nrequired to cast it explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nFixed tests.operators.operators:TransferTests.test_mysql_to_hive_type_conversion.\r\nAlso, I confirmed that this fix works with MySQL 5.7.22 and Hive 1.2.1.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2590) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAfter [this commit](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/d642e38ec7eac129739042e77f78b1dae4f2615e#diff-3f191f9ec6c3dfda1cd2ef79a01725aa), DbApiHook.run() will only commit when the autocommit field is set for the connection. For those don't support autocommit (e.g. sqlite_hook), the connection won't commit the query, which is a change of behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is currently breaking CI (tests/core.py:CoreTest.test_check_operators).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nfixes tests/core.py:CoreTest.test_check_operators\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2586/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nBefore [this commit](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/a0deb506c070637abc3c426bc7d060e3fe6c854d#diff-30054b6fa334216ba6e66c9f07025cd2R35), subprocess created by bash operator only inherits env vars from the parent process. However, it does not inherit the proper env var from the `airflow worker` process because we had a bug in the [`sudo airflow run --raw` command](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/task/task_runner/base_task_runner.py#L81). The commit was created to address the bug for bash operator. The bug was later on fixed in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/354492bc597130f43c76e7bec4bc894fb6deb7fe) and thus bash operator does not need and should not get AIRFLOW_HOME value from the config (otherwise there might be discrepancy between the AIRFLOW_HOME value in the parent process and the child process).\r\n\r\nPYTHONPATH on the otherhand, is always passed to the subprocess in the env var maps so we don't need it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/operators/bash_operators.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2585\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR fixes:\r\n (1) issue with UUID type conversion: currently UUID is converted to hex string, but should be converted to base64-encoded as that is the required format in BigQuery for uploading.\r\n (2) Issue with configuring load balancing policy in CassandraHook: currently the hook only successfully instantiate with the default LB policy, but throw an exception if attempts to pass in a custom LB policy in the extra field.\r\n(3) Issue with connections not closed properly after use: should always shut down the cluster in the operator to close all sessions/connections associated with the cluster instance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit tests added/fixed:\r\n  - tests.contrib.hooks.test_cassandra_hook\r\n  - tests.contrib.operators.test_cassandra_to_gcs_operator\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2578) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSometimes the Jira API is not directly accessible on certain machines for security reasons. Proxies can be used to get around that and the Python Jira library offers support for that. This PR simply adds the option to include proxies when creating the JiraHook.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDifficult to test since we'd have to set up test environment with no access to a Jira host except through a proxy + since default params are used this has no impact on anybody's existing usage of the JiraHook.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\n@pahwaranger @saguziel

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2578) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSometimes the Jira API is not directly accessible on certain machines for security reasons. Proxies can be used to get around that and the Python Jira library offers support for that. This PR simply adds the option to include proxies when creating the JiraHook.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDifficult to test since we'd have to set up test environment with no access to a Jira host except through a proxy + since default params are used this has no impact on anybody's existing usage of the JiraHook.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff

accept my PR to add a new operator `JdbcGetFirstOperator`\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2577\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR adds a new contrib operator `JdbcGetFirstOperator` which is intended for use audit/validation/aggreagation\r\nSQL queries that select a single row. This operator will fetch the first row from the database and xcom it so that it can be evaluated by down_stream tasks to make decisions within the DAG.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: I could not find any existing JdbcOperator tests, I'm not sure how I would mock this operator? If there are any ideas/examples for mocking this, I'd be happy to write up a test. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-07T16:33:18Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T17:34:33Z","closed_at":"2018-07-10T17:34:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ae6ac2072f9892b1fff5a9586891c4d98737828","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3476/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3476/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3476/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1fffec6a36d59c79784cd2f33c9841496aab9eb4","head":{"label":"jbacon:jdbc_get_first_operator","ref":"jdbc_get_first_operator","sha":"1fffec6a36d59c79784cd2f33c9841496aab9eb4","user":{"login":"jbacon","id":7133200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzMyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7133200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon","html_url":"https://github.com/jbacon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119429189,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk0MjkxODk=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"jbacon/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jbacon","id":7133200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzMyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7133200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon","html_url":"https://github.com/jbacon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbacon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jbacon/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

please accept my PR to improve the S3Hook.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2315) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2315\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR improves the S3Hook by adding a new user-defined JSON extra `s3_upload_args` to allow passing S3 transfer upload arguments (boto3.s3.transfer.S3Transfer.ALLOWED_UPLOAD_ARGS) via embedded JSON. The PR also refactors S3Hook code to reduce duplication. While there are many ways to use this new feature, my specific needs require running Airflow Workers (Celery) across multiple AWS accounts. In this case, to use S3RemoteLogging successfully (from all the workers) I need to pass ExtraArgs to the logger's S3Hook to grant the bucket owner (centralized log bucket) full permission to the log files.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: \r\nNew tests are added in `tests/hooks/test_s3_hooks.py` including a `test_load_byes_with_extras` and `test_load_string_with_extras`. The mock_s3 module successfully mocks the ExtraArgs for the virtual S3 resources. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-07T15:19:09Z","updated_at":"2018-12-24T00:13:07Z","closed_at":"2018-12-24T00:13:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cd048385062c6558e4bdff1952ca6d2ce17a3ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1762\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe ssh_hook.create_tunnel was opening a tunnel using a popen. Moreover, it had the local port as a required argument. This PR refactored it to use the sshtunnel package build ontop of paramiko.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2573\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn current bigquery_hook.py, we have a `_bq_cast(string_field, bq_type)` function that help casts a BigQuery row to the appropriate data types. \r\n```\r\nelif bq_type == 'INTEGER' or bq_type == 'TIMESTAMP':\r\n    return int(string_field)\r\n```\r\nHowever, when a bq_type equals to 'TIMESTAMP', it causes ValueError.\r\n```\r\n>>> int('1.458668898E9')\r\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1.458668898E9'\r\n```\r\nTo solve this, we should instead cast to `TIMESTAMP` field to float.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1115) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1115\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR fixes the oauth flow when github_enterprise host is \"github.com\" itself. In this case the API hostname is not github.com but api.github.com (https://developer.github.com/v3/#schema)\r\nFor all other cases, the existing behavior is correct (https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.13/v3/#schema) and it is not affected by this PR.\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any test for the auth backends and it is a small change. However please let me know if I need to add a test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2567\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify the construction of DAG, it is useful to be able to extract the execution result of the container as XCom.\r\nUsers will be able to do this by writing the result as the `result.json` in `/airflow/xcom` directory mounted on the container automatically.\r\nThis function is realized by Pod's sidecar container.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdd KubernetesPodOperatorTest. test_xcom_push\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-05T08:19:48Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T07:55:20Z","closed_at":"2018-06-19T07:55:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fe7f5759ad9aa254db216e798bc2076bcdede4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fc1aabb795ead5287a2a5a7f32e2867a343def67","head":{"label":"mrkm4ntr:airflow-2567","ref":"airflow-2567","sha":"fc1aabb795ead5287a2a5a7f32e2867a343def67","user":{"login":"mrkm4ntr","id":6421289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjEyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6421289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr","html_url":"https://github.com/mrkm4ntr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":99537907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5OTUzNzkwNw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mrkm4ntr/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mrkm4ntr","id":6421289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjEyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6421289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr","html_url":"https://github.com/mrkm4ntr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mrkm4ntr/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2355\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nParameters passed through `airflow trigger_dag -c '{\"text\": \"blah\"}'` can be accessed through \r\n`{{ dag_run.conf.text }}` in subdag.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-59\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR implements bulk_dump and bulk_load,\r\nwhich are inherited from DbApiHook and\r\nalready implemented for MySqlHook.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- tests.hooks.test_postgres_hook:TestPostgresHook.test_bulk_load\r\n- tests.hooks.test_postgres_hook:TestPostgresHook.test_bulk_dump\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-03T23:30:06Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:23:23Z","closed_at":"2018-06-09T20:15:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab5df31159df58059b2aec27c9c60ed40f70c81a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3456/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3456/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3456/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9059a9964c9c5f16181d89cb191ef5b1aefa7fc1","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-59","ref":"AIRFLOW-59","sha":"9059a9964c9c5f16181d89cb191ef5b1aefa7fc1","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2557\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPaged tests for s3 are taking over 120 seconds. The\r\nfunctionality testes is part of the standard boto suite\r\nand part of its own tests.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntests removed.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\ncc

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2513\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Change `bql` to `sql` for BigQuery Hooks & Operators for consistency. Discussed in more detail [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2513)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- `test_bql_deprecation_warning`\r\n- `test_nobql_nosql_param_error`\r\n- `BigQueryOperatorTest.test_bql_deprecation_warning`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-03T01:14:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:15:08Z","closed_at":"2018-06-04T09:05:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6e708ff606c99e8fa605183b64eaf6b16ea9bde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a969c88ee80ed19a05106662062bc13414c5ddf9","head":{"label":"kaxil:consistent-bq-lang","ref":"consistent-bq-lang","sha":"a969c88ee80ed19a05106662062bc13414c5ddf9","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2554\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis change allows easy access to inlets/outlets in templates e.g.\r\nFile(name=\"myfile\") can be accessed by {{ myfile.XXXX }}. In case\r\nit the name collides with dag level names (e.g. \"dag\") in can be\r\naccessed by {{ inlet['dag'] }}.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nCurrent tests cover this.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nAdded.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-02T19:35:58Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T19:19:43Z","closed_at":"2018-12-19T19:19:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a0bbef63ce0c288a240000851a4d1d676cb5e20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

DataProc Workflow Template operators should report errors when jobs\r\nfail, even though the errors are not propagated up to the 'error'\r\nfield of the DataProcOperation API response object.\r\n\r\nThis commit checks the outcomes of the individual jobs for errors, and\r\nraises an Exception if any are detected.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is consistent in spirit with the documentation for\r\nDataProc Workflow templates, which states \"A failure in any node in a\r\nworkflow will cause the workflow to fail.\"  See:\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/workflows/overview\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2549) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThere are no UI changes.  The only change is that DataProcWorkflowTemplate-based operators will report failures when any of their component jobs/nodes fail, whereas previously those operators would report successes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds unit tests to make sure that the _DataProcOperator class responds properly to both successful and failed workflow template operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    N/A\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2537\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n1. Add an option to backfill command to allow user to clear the existing dag run(could be running, failing, success etc). But it should clear the backfill dag run, not others(e.g scheduled, manual etc)\r\n2. clear command shouldn't clear the backfill  dag runs.(This is trickey as the task instances are shared by scheduled dag run and backfill dag run)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n will add a test if the approach looks ok.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2546\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe following log is flooded in the cli when running backfill:\r\n```\r\n[2018-05-31 00:37:22,376] {cli.py:454} ERROR - Section kubernetes Option git_sync_container_tag does not exist in the config!\r\n[2018-05-31 00:37:22,376] {cli.py:454} ERROR - Section kubernetes Option git_sync_init_container_name does not exist in the config!\r\n[2018-05-31 00:37:22,377] {cli.py:454} ERROR - Section kubernetes Option worker_service_account_name does not exist in the config!\r\n[2018-05-31 00:37:22,377] {cli.py:454} ERROR - Section kubernetes Option image_pull_secrets does not exist in the config!\r\n[2018-05-31 00:37:22,377] {cli.py:454} ERROR - Section kubernetes Option gcp_service_account_keys does not exist in the config!\r\n[2018-05-31 00:37:22,377] {cli.py:454} ERROR - Section kubernetes Option in_cluster does not exist in the config!\r\n```\r\nSet the logging level correctly to avoid this error. To clarify, this error is fine and non-blocking for running backfill. It just indicates user airflow.cfg doesn't include those specific configs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

KubernetesOperator.\r\nThis eliminates confusing DeprecationWarnings when\r\nsetting up a default airflow install where additional\r\nkubernetes modules are not installed.\r\n\r\nAlso, use LoggingMixin instead of logger module.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`HiveServer2Hook.get_results` is overwriting records when multiple sql statements are passed. This might be superflous when the first statements are just `SET`, but in principle we want to check if that's also the case. This PR addresses that, plus it refactors some existing Python code.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies existing methods. The current test suite should catch regressions.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\nDescription\r\n[ x ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAIRFLOW-83 requests a mongo hook and operator contribution. We had one laying around that I expanded to be more in line with Airflow practices.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n[ x ] My PR adds the following unit tests OR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdds 6 unit tests for the hook\r\nWould love more insight on proper Operator testing if having no tests for it is unacceptable\r\n\r\nCommits\r\n[ x ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"How to write a good git commit message\":\r\n\r\nSubject is separated from body by a blank line\r\nSubject is limited to 50 characters\r\nSubject does not end with a period\r\nSubject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\nBody wraps at 72 characters\r\nBody explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n[ x ] Passes git diff

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2525\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFor now PostgresHook.copy_expert supports\r\n\"COPY TO\" but not \"COPY FROM\", because it\r\nopens a file with write mode and doesn't\r\ncommit operations. This PR fixes it by\r\nopening a file with read and write mode\r\nand committing operations at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nFixed tests.hooks.test_postgres_hook:TestPostgresHook.test_copy_expert to confirm that the open() function is called with read and write mode and operations are committed at last.\r\nIn addition, I confirmed that the fixed version worked with both COPY FROM and COPY TO with PostgreSQL 9.5.12.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-25T15:08:19Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T14:02:21Z","closed_at":"2018-05-25T17:19:21Z","merged_at":"2018-05-25T17:19:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"dabf1b962dcd4323a6ea723076afcd2a20fcb354","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/dabf1b962dcd4323a6ea723076afcd2a20fcb354","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-2525","ref":"AIRFLOW-2525","sha":"dabf1b962dcd4323a6ea723076afcd2a20fcb354","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8
