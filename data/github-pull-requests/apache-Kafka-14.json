in `ShareConsumeRequestManager`, after we receive a `ShareFetchResponse`, if the subscription changes before we acknowledge(via `ShareFetch`), then we do not acknowledge the records which are not part of the updated subscription. \r\nInstead we must acknowledge all the records that we had received irrespective of the current subscription.\r\nThis bug is only when we are acknowledging via `ShareFetch` where we use `SubscriptionState::fetchablePartitions` to obtain the partitions to fetch.\r\nIn `ShareAcknowledge`, as we are getting the partitions from the active share sessions, even if the subscription changed, the session would remain active.\r\nIn future, we would ideally refactor to make the `ShareFetch` also use the active share sessions instead of `SubscriptionState`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-18T06:35:06Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T07:36:11Z","closed_at":"2024-11-05T07:36:11Z","merged_at":"2024-11-05T07:36:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd4d58899bcc5c4ac69c5d3c309bc05ed7bf4e20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

`MockLog` or `KafkaMetadataLog`'s read method for a given `startOffset` returns a `LogOffsetMetadata` object that contains an offset field. In the case of `MockLog`, this offset field is the base offset of the record batch which contains `startOffset`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in `KafkaMetadataLog`, this offset field is set to the given `startOffset`. If the given `startOffset` is in the middle of a batch, the returned `LogOffsetMetadata` will have an offset that does not match the file position of the returned batch. This makes the javadoc for `LogSegment#read` inaccurate since `startOffset` is not a lower bound when `startOffset` is not a batch's baseOffset (the base offset of the batch containing startOffset is the lower bound). \r\n\r\nThis difference became an issue for https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17500/files because checking a whether a `snapshotId.offset` was batch aligned using the `LogOffsetMetadata.offset()` returned from `read` would work for `raft` tests that rely on `MockLog`, but this check would always be trivially true for `KafkaMetadataLog` (`snapshotId.offset == startOffset == LogOffsetMetadata.offset()`).\r\n\r\nThis PR will modify `LogSegment#read` so it returns the batch start offset of the batch that contains `startOffset`, which is the actual offset being pointed to by the byte position in `LogOffsetMetadata`. This change will result in `KafkaMetadataLog#read`'s behavior matching `MockLog#read`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

described in KIP-500, the Kafka controller monitors the liveness of each broker in the cluster. It gathers this information from heartbeats sent from the brokers themselves.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases, the main controller thread may get blocked for several seconds at a time. In the current code, this will result in the controller being unable to update the last contact times for the brokers during this time.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the controller heartbeat handling to be partially lockless. Specifically, the last contact time for each broker will be updated locklessly prior to the rest of the heartbeat handling. This will ensure that heartbeats always get through.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR adds a PeriodicTaskControlManager to better manage periodic tasks. This should help handle the very common pattern where we want to schedule a background task at some frequency. We also want the background task to be immediately rescheduled if there is too much work to be done in one event.","created_at":"2024-10-14T18:32:36Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T15:36:14Z","closed_at":"2024-10-28T15:36:09Z","merged_at":"2024-10-28T15:36:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"14a9130f6fa31c10cb65cc500c101148d0410306","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17502/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17502/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17502/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bc574fcc292bd72133671176a0067d5078590595","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-17793","ref":"KAFKA-17793","sha":"bc574fcc292bd72133671176a0067d5078590595","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

Kafka documentation includes a description of the Kafka protocol (https://kafka.apache.org/protocol). This is useful to someone wanting to understand the details of the protocol. However, in the area of tagged fields, the documentation is not helpful.\r\n\r\nTagged fields provide a way of supplying optional data in a request or response. Modern requests and responses usually permit tagged fields, although they are relatively rarely used in practice.\r\n\r\nOne RPC in which tagged fields contain important information is the APIVersionsResponse. In v3 and above, the response contains the set of supported and finalised features, which can be used by a client to determine whether a broker supports a feature. This information is carried as tagged fields, but if you read the documentation of the protocol, you would be entirely in the dark.\r\n\r\nThis improvement adds tagged field information into the protocol documentation.\r\n\r\nHere's an example before the change. Each of the TAG_BUFFER fields is included in the table of fields, even ones for which there are no tagged fields defined.\r\n\r\n![APIVersionsResponse_before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17ba1ee6-a914-4ddd-9f81-2b58ef046e8e)\r\n\r\nHere's the same RPC response in which only the TAG_BUFFER which actually has tagged fields defined is in the table, and the tagged field descriptions are included in the table in a sub-table.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"997\" alt=\"APIVersionsResponse_after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e47c3381-8994-4de9-9469-646c37311520\">\r\n\r\nThis change also indicates which RPC request versions are unstable.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

Issue Details: Inside TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager::close, one thread(t1) is calling join on initializationThread thread after taking writeLock on \"lock\" object => t1 will wait for initializationThread to complete. Internally initializationThread is also using writeLock on \"lock\" object. This can cause deadlock in below situation\r\n\r\n1. initializationThread is started\r\n2. close has been invoked as part of a separate thread. But this thread is not yet scheduled by OS.\r\n3. At line 430, initializationThread is preempted and OS has started running close thread. close takes writeLock and invoked join on initializationThread.\r\n4. Now OS schedules initializationThread again and at line 433 this thread also tries to take writeLock. But since writeLock is already held by close thread => both are waiting on each other to complete. initializationThread will wait on close to release the writeLock, while close thread will wait for completion of initializationThread\r\n\r\nFix Details: We can avoid taking lock inside close() method as there no operations with any side effects. closing instance variable is of type AtomicBoolean => no race condition when updating it to true. .\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

Details: Inside TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager::close, one thread(t1) is calling join on initializationThread thread after taking writeLock on \"lock\" object => t1 will wait for initializationThread to complete. Internally initializationThread is also using writeLock on \"lock\" object. This can cause deadlock in below situation\r\n\r\n1. initializationThread is started\r\n2. close has been invoked as part of a separate thread. But this thread is not yet scheduled by OS.\r\n3. At line 430, initializationThread is preempted and OS has started running close thread. close takes writeLock and invoked join on initializationThread.\r\n4. Now OS schedules initializationThread again and at line 433 this thread also tries to take writeLock. But since writeLock is already held by close threaf => both are waiting on each other to complete. initializationThread will wait on close to unlock the writeLock, while close thread will wait for completion of initializationThread\r\n\r\nInside TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager, initializationThread instance variable is protected by ReentrantReadWriteLock lock object -> lock But, this same thread is also using writeLock above while execution.\r\n\r\n=> causing deadlock situation.\r\n\r\nFix Details: If we see the access patterns of initializationThread instance variable, we can convert it into AtomicReference to control read/write to it atomically. Using this we can avoid taking writeLock before calling join on initializationThread. Once initializationThread is done then close thread will awake and can take the writeLock only after that.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

PR uses the capability added in PR: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17473, which allows to attach listener for client instances cleanup on client disconnection.\r\n\r\nThe ClientsMetricManager keeps the client instance cache at a limit of 16384. The active connections can be low, but connections can be created and destroyed in short span. Which hits the cache limit and results in cache miss for new connections.\r\n\r\nThe client instance cache keeps the instances for 3 * push interval ms. Hence when the cache gets full it creates new instances for every request while evicting others from cache. This gives some bumps to the GC for the broker and eventually CPU. Though with evicting early it will still be garbage collected but the long running active connections will not be removed from the cache.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds capability to evict client instances from cache when the connection from client is dropped.\r\n\r\nNote: There exists a cleanup task which evicts the instances on timebound expiry. That will still be required to remove any idle connections which have stopped sending telemetry data.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-11T23:41:29Z","updated_at":"2024-10-17T17:10:13Z","closed_at":"2024-10-17T17:10:13Z","merged_at":"2024-10-17T17:10:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"5da3b9410dc5e19de438337f7e4e28de5ad399bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chia7712","id":6234750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzQ3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6234750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712","html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"AndrewJSchofield","id":13795597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzk1NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13795597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewJSchofield","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

part of KIP-932, a new internal topic `__share_group_state` was introduced. There are 2 types of records which are currently being added in this topic - `ShareSnapshotKey/Value` and `ShareUpdateKey/Value`\r\nIn light of this, we must make the existing tooling like `kafka-console-consumer` and `kafka-dump-log` aware of these records for debugging and introspection purposes.\r\nThis PR introduces `ShareGroupStateMessageFormatter` to be used used with `kafka-console-consumer` and adds an internal class `ShareGroupStateMessageParser` in `DumpLogSegments.scala`.\r\nUnit tests have been added to `DumpLogSegmentsTest.scala`\r\n\r\n###

PR introduces two improvements to enhance code consistency and readability:\r\n\r\n1. Extract duplicate exception message into a private constant\r\n   - The message \"Acquisition lock never got released.\" is now a private static final String constant ACQUISITION_LOCK_NEVER_GOT_RELEASED\r\n   - Reduces duplication and improves maintainability\r\n   - Makes it easier to update this message in the future if needed\r\n   - Encapsulates the constant within the class, adhering to best practices for information hiding\r\n\r\n2. Replace hardcoded \"member-1\" strings with existing MEMBER_ID constant\r\n   - Enhances code consistency across the codebase\r\n   - Makes future updates easier by centralizing the member ID value\r\n   - Reduces the risk of typos or inconsistencies when referring to member IDs\r\n\r\nPlease review these changes and provide any feedback or concerns.
