Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2761) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSummary of major changes:\r\n- Celery executor will create a process pool to enqueue celery task in parallel.\r\n- Scheduler job will not pass TaskInstance to executor when trying to queue command, instead it passes SimpleTaskInstance, in order to enable parallel enqueuing.\r\n- Scheduler no longer checks task instance state before enqueuing because worker already checks task instance state before executing. Our cluster has been requeuing everything for a long time and there should be no risk removing that redundant check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntests/executors/test_celery_executor.py:TestCeleryExecutor.test_error_sending_task\r\ntests/jobs.py:SchedulerJobTest.test_change_state_for_tasks_failed_to_execute\r\n\r\nAlso updated existing failing unit test.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nBefore (32k tasks should run on 13:30 but didn't get >30k running tasks until 13:41):\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-31 at 3 26 48 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/45852558-3a8b0980-bcf5-11e8-803f-d98f56c81a9c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter (32k tasks should run on 15:10 and got them all running at 15:14):\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-31 at 3 26 11 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/45852419-97d28b00-bcf4-11e8-89b2-79481dbf8030.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-21T00:25:59Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T02:57:25Z","closed_at":"2018-11-25T03:10:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92afa210a38a38655fc93701ccb50d06b8ff8e4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a338f370935b4ce498d3503a30aeea7b9d33429c","head":{"label":"KevinYang21:kevin_yang_parallelize_enqueue","ref":"kevin_yang_parallelize_enqueue","sha":"a338f370935b4ce498d3503a30aeea7b9d33429c","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106481430,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDY0ODE0MzA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"KevinYang21/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3375\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to the BranchPythonOperator for handling a list of tasks, so multiple branches can be returned. A single task_id string is still supported.\r\n\r\nThis is now possible with this PR:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/48800846-3a19e980-ed0b-11e8-89d0-29ceba2ce2fb.png)\r\n\r\nBy returning a list of task ids:\r\n```BranchPythonOperator(task_id='your_dag', dag=dag, python_callable=lambda: ['branch_1', 'branch_2'])```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded `test_branch_list_without_dag_run` test to BranchOperatorTest.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nAdded new functionality in parentheses.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-20T20:34:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T14:59:20Z","closed_at":"2018-11-21T14:59:20Z","merged_at":"2018-11-21T14:59:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad2c968fc8c2ed1d570bb3e902b2a1522b88d63d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b7e82020bc86fe6c01a044bbf37605c7cfcd9917","head":{"label":"BasPH:multi-task-branch-python-operator","ref":"multi-task-branch-python-operator","sha":"b7e82020bc86fe6c01a044bbf37605c7cfcd9917","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5c7e4e4e9c2014a78830a81162532c0f2eecd6e4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nCreating a pod that exceeds a namespace's resource quota throws an ApiException. This change catches the exception and the task is re-queued inside the Executor instead of killing the scheduler.\r\n\r\n`click 7.0` was recently released but `flask-appbuilder 1.11.1 has requirement click==6.7`. I have pinned `click==6.7` to make the dependencies resolve.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThis adds a single test `TestKubernetesExecutor. test_run_next_exception` that covers this single scenario. Without the changes this test fails when the ApiException is not caught. \r\n\r\nThis is the first test case for the `KubernetesExecutor`,  so I needed to add the `[kubernetes]` section to `default_test.cfg` so that the `KubernetesExecutor` can be built without exceptions.\r\n\r\nJira ticket:

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTurns out I wasn't very consistent in my PR removing the spot in the Airflow logo (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4065). The file size increased by 22KB and there are 4 more Airflow logo images containing the same spot.\r\n\r\nI this PR, I drastically reduced image size by exporting with Photoshop, removing all metadata, and with 8-bit and RGB colors. This was already the case in all Airflow logos, but turns out my Photoshop stored with 24-bit colors by default. The end result:\r\n\r\nairflow/www/static/pin_large.jpg | 400kb -> 316kb\r\nairflow/www/static/pin_large.png | 358kb -> 104kb\r\nairflow/www_rbac/static/pin_large.jpg | 400kb -> 316kb\r\nairflow/www_rbac/static/pin_large.png | 358kb -> 104kb\r\ndocs/img/pin_large.png | 381kb -> 104kb\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo tests required.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-17T18:14:41Z","updated_at":"2018-11-17T18:51:03Z","closed_at":"2018-11-17T18:51:03Z","merged_at":"2018-11-17T18:51:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa69f22c78572cd21a5bc595d1dcd40639c7525a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b8c18599ef1f4da7c0af58735cbb5ea19da02abd","head":{"label":"BasPH:fix-all-logos","ref":"fix-all-logos","sha":"b8c18599ef1f4da7c0af58735cbb5ea19da02abd","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7c82ecb0df549baa5779034b0c355897eef9f10c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSearch will append to the query string rather than replacing it. Allows users to decide whether they want to search for hidden DAGs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo existing tests around the DAGs template.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3355\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBigQueryCursor.execute uses dict.iteritems internally,\r\nso it fails with Python3 if binding parameters are\r\nprovided. This PR fixes this problem.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntests.contrib.hooks.test_bigquery_hook:TestBigQueryCursor\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-16T00:14:06Z","updated_at":"2018-11-16T22:31:25Z","closed_at":"2018-11-16T22:31:24Z","merged_at":"2018-11-16T22:31:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"165643b609fa95ca187d67733cdc7d2cb815b8d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4198/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4198/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4198/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/eab19b0d684c18348128fdad065bae3e857ba617","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-3355","ref":"AIRFLOW-3355","sha":"eab19b0d684c18348128fdad065bae3e857ba617","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira]\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3348\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn some cases dag run statistics may become outdated, for example, when dag run is deleted.\r\n\r\nAs the view from which dag runs are deleted permits to delete runs from multiple dags in a single transaction, this seems to be the most reasonable place to update run statistics\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n Covered by existing test for `/refresh`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-15T22:20:18Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T22:02:27Z","closed_at":"2018-11-22T22:34:46Z","merged_at":"2018-11-22T22:34:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"7f0b4a77d7b8d43046fe2e9ba75ac8f5a6cd0e94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4197/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4197/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4197/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/75319e2dd22b8b486c4d5e91f8344de2e231ba11","head":{"label":"ms32035:refresh_dags_stats","ref":"refresh_dags_stats","sha":"75319e2dd22b8b486c4d5e91f8344de2e231ba11","user":{"login":"ms32035","id":5060473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjA0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5060473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035","html_url":"https://github.com/ms32035","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115654468,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU2NTQ0Njg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"ms32035/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ms32035","id":5060473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjA0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5060473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035","html_url":"https://github.com/ms32035","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ms32035/airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3368 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe COPY command is incorrect. {table} parameter refers to the table in Redshift where the S3 file will be copied to, and not to a table that is inside AWS S3, so  \"/{table}\" needs to be removed from the COPY command\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3343\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] When we updated the version of docker.py in #4049 we missed a breaking change. The API of `wait()` changed to return a dict, not just a number so this\r\nOperator wasn't actually working, but the tests were passing because the\r\nreturn was mocked in-correctly.\r\n\r\nSince it appears that the python Docker module follows semver, with breaking changes only on major versions I have also changed the format specifier so we don't pull in 4.0.0 accidentally in the future.\r\n\r\nI also removed `shm_size` from kwargs passed to BaseOperator to avoid\r\nthe deprecation warning about unknown args.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-14T17:26:30Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T22:06:19Z","closed_at":"2018-11-14T22:06:04Z","merged_at":"2018-11-14T22:06:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d6e8cd4e614f58a21e0aba9b2a02bc8bcbdc24b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fff2a532043741cc8a2a3ed2c8f6ea023140417b","head":{"label":"ashb:dockerpy3-api-changes","ref":"dockerpy3-api-changes","sha":"fff2a532043741cc8a2a3ed2c8f6ea023140417b","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDAG(\r\n    default_args={\r\n        'start_date': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 1),\r\n    },\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would fail to correctly set `self.timezone` (as the start date was naive/timezone-less) - this fixes it\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Simple test added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-14T15:11:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T21:35:07Z","closed_at":"2018-11-14T21:35:04Z","merged_at":"2018-11-14T21:35:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e1304a7c08cbd86500a9e11eeff47fbdddc0059","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d9ec30c80c6c94f9abca135f0fc68b1ce058cfd2","head":{"label":"apache:defeault_arg_start_date_naive","ref":"defeault_arg_start_date_naive","sha":"d9ec30c80c6c94f9abca135f0fc68b1ce058cfd2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3336/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTake the case where a task has 2 or more upstream parents and 1 or more of them can skipped. If TriggerRule ALL_DONE is used then the task will trigger even when upstream tasks fail. However if TriggerRule ALL_SUCCESS is used the task won't be triggered if any upstream are skipped. This creates a gap in functionality where it is necessary for \"skipped\" to be treated as \"success\" so that the task only runs if all parents succeed or are skipped. Said another way this allows tasks to be run if all ancestors do NOT fail.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a new trigger rule has been added that will count skipped as success to close this gap in functionality.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

version information to the\r\nlicense declarations to cope with the possibility of projects changing\r\nlicenses on us in the future.\r\n\r\nWhere possible I have worked out the version we are actually using, but\r\nwhere that hasn't been possible and the project is still on the same\r\nlicense (they all were) I have taken the latest version as of right now\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-12T19:42:26Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T21:07:25Z","closed_at":"2018-11-12T20:49:55Z","merged_at":"2018-11-12T20:49:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"34b310e56f925a52c0e604b05cbeabd6d01207dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4177/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4177/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4177/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c90959c9d2eb8d897ac25636dcfe55ab7a317e44","head":{"label":"ashb:add-version-to-license-file","ref":"add-version-to-license-file","sha":"c90959c9d2eb8d897ac25636dcfe55ab7a317e44","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-571\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-571\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI added gunicorn_config (-gc) param for get possible send all params what available in gunicorn server without adding support of them as separate args in Airflow. I also refactored webserver function with saving full backward compatibility. It's necessary to get possible to add tests. \r\n\r\nI remove lines with getting vars from config (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4174/files#diff-1c2404a3a60f829127232842250ff406L839), because it's already done one step before - in defaults https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/bin/cli.py#L1745  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3275\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nOperator that performs a DDL or DML SQL query in Google Cloud SQL instance.\r\nThe DQL (retrieving data from Google Cloud SQL) is not supported - you might\r\n run the SELECT queries but results of those queries are discarded.\r\n\r\nYou should be able specify various connectivity methods to connect to a\r\nrunning instance - starting from Public IP plain connection, through Public IP\r\nwith SSL or both TCP and socket connection via Cloud SQL Proxy.\r\nThe proxy should be downloaded and started/stopped dynamically as\r\nneeded by the operator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests.contrib.operators/test_gcp_sql_operator\r\n     CloudSqlQueryValidationTest\r\n     CloudSqlProxyIntegrationTest\r\n     CloudSqlQueryExampleDagsIntegrationTest\r\n\r\nNote that the two *IntegrationTest above are skipped by default - they require special configuration - i.e folder and key to authorise in GCP which we do not have for the Apache repo yet. It is useful for development where you can configure your environment to run the integration tests in your own GCP project. This is a working proof of concept on how GCP integration tests can work - which we might soon turn into more general proposal on how to handle it.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-09T19:29:09Z","updated_at":"2018-12-16T20:40:23Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T09:43:37Z","merged_at":"2018-11-13T09:43:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7e80d60f971bdf26cebada321368a17d3da91e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4170/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4170/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4170/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/505bfa395f9f1a94c67c1103956cf5d938dbede1","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:cloudsql-query1","ref":"cloudsql-query1","sha":"505bfa395f9f1a94c67c1103956cf5d938dbede1","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Implement Instance Group Managers operators for GCE](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3220) issue and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThere are two operators:\r\n* GceInstanceTemplateCopy - existing template is copied with some\r\nchanges specified\r\n* GceInstanceGroupManagerUpdateVersion - template is replaced in\r\nthe instance group manager with patch method\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests.contrib.operators.test_gcp_compute_operator.\r\n   GceInstanceTemplateCopyTest\r\n   GceInstanceGroupManagerUpdateTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

a function to BigQueryHook to check the existence of a dataset. \r\nReturn True if the dataset exists.\r\nReturn False if 404 error received.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow-3318](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3318) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nTo check the existence of a dataset in BigQuery, existing BigQueryHook only supports either 1) using get_datasets_list() to get all the datasets and then searching the target dataset from the list; or 2) using get_dataset().\r\n\r\nHowever, with get_dataset(), it raises AirflowException whenever an HttpError received. So it has no capabilities to determine if the dataset exists or not.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, I've added a function to return a boolean value representing the existence of the dataset.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests.contrib.hooks.test_bigquery_hook:TestDatasetsOperations.test_check_dataset_exists\r\ntests.contrib.hooks.test_bigquery_hook:TestDatasetsOperations.test_check_dataset_exists_not_exist\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

the automatic inlets feature is described to be able to skip\r\noperations that produce no outlets. This changes the behaviour of the\r\nauto inlets feature in order so that the presence of non outlet\r\nproducing operations are effectively ignored while still receiving all\r\noutlets from upstream tasks.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3314\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nUses a tree search algorithm in order to find upstream outlets to be used as inlets. Provides expected behaviour as described in the previous documentation to receive outlets. \r\n\r\n@bolkedebruin, do you have any input on these changes?\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdds unit tests to tests/lineage/test_lineage.py\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm breaking any guidelines, this is my first OSS pull request.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3306\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBy default, flask-sqlalchemy tracks model changes for its event system, which adds some overhead. Since I don't think we're using the flask-sqlalchemy event system, we should be able to turn off modification tracking and improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nJust a config change; existing tests should cover it.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-689\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Ability to use Okta's api based authentication mechanism\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- Install Okta SDK with pip onto your airflow instance\r\n- Add in your Okta API key and organization URL (usually your_org.okta.com) in the config\r\n- Replace backend with okta_auth in the config\r\n- Log in\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-06T12:55:59Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T00:42:14Z","closed_at":"2018-12-29T05:53:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0a8f2ba164ad5592292f70ff45ae2915c736938","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3303) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] We are using two different versions of UI in Apache Airflow. Idea is to deprecate and remove the older version of UI and use the new Flask App Builder (RBAC) version as the default UI from now on. (most probably in release 2.0.x)\r\nThis PR removes the old UI and renames the references of `www_rbac` to `www`. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Skipped some of the test case classes as these were purely using the older version of application and configurations. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\n**All the help with manual testing would be highly appreciated 🙂**

Otherwise, all jobs will\r\nalways be started in us-central1.\r\n\r\nIn case there is no region configured, the default region `us-central1` will get picked up.\r\n\r\nTo make it even worse, the polling for the job status already honors the\r\nregion parameter and will search for the job in the wrong region in the\r\ncurrent implementation. Because the job's status is not found, the\r\ncorresponding Airflow task will hang.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a second approach and follow-up of #4125\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n`tests.contrib.hooks.test_gcp_dataflow_hook.DataFlowTemplateHookTest` has been modified\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

than their start state\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow-1710](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-1710\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1710\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis fixes the infinite loop in the AF jobs scheduler scanning a DAG with a start date in Daylight Savings Time while evaluating a potential run date in Standard Time.\r\n\r\nThe infinite loop Airflow gets trapped in is below:\r\n\r\n`while next_run_date <= last_run.execution_date:\r\n    next_run_date = dag.following_schedule(next_run_date)`\r\n\r\ndag.following_schedule is not incrementing as expected. It instead starts to repeating values that dag.following_schedule has already returned.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by an interaction between a pendulum instance timezone having a DST offset this is 'illegal' for the evaluated next run date.\r\n\r\nIE, If I call following_schedule with a dag.timezone that has a DST offset of -5, but on the date being evaluated the value should be -6, the function stops incrementing and repeats ranges of values.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to simply drop the dst offset from dag.timezone.  dag.following_schedule will then increment normally, it fixes the infinite loop.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI need help with my PR\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-05T23:01:55Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T21:04:30Z","closed_at":"2018-11-07T15:04:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96603cf15d05d0a45745f54ead1299327a3d8398","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4136/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4136/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4136/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0730af7eb91f1b33352efa3b6188228bac01afc6","head":{"label":"SpareFoot:feature-fix-for-dst-infinite-loop","ref":"feature-fix-for-dst-infinite-loop","sha":"0730af7eb91f1b33352efa3b6188228bac01afc6","user":{"login":"SpareFoot","id":4613577,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2MTM1Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4613577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot","html_url":"https://github.com/SpareFoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138310840,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzgzMTA4NDA=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"SpareFoot/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SpareFoot","id":4613577,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2MTM1Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4613577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot","html_url":"https://github.com/SpareFoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpareFoot/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SpareFoot/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3213) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3213\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- This PR adds a new operator, AdlsToGoogleCloudStorageOperator, which copies files from Azure Data Lake to Google Cloud storage, and can optionally \"sync\" between the two, copying only files that don't exist in the destination. It functions much like the existing S3 to GCS and GCS to S3 operators. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest_init\r\ntest_execute\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-05T16:19:04Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T23:18:41Z","closed_at":"2018-11-21T23:18:41Z","merged_at":"2018-11-21T23:18:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"6dee66f4662ac3750d902e2047c004c528bfb917","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0f2a2bfe8f2078a2b14c2a8412d19f5fc5e14bb4","head":{"label":"bkvarda:adlstogcsoperator","ref":"adlstogcsoperator","sha":"0f2a2bfe8f2078a2b14c2a8412d19f5fc5e14bb4","user":{"login":"bkvarda","id":6834678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzQ2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6834678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda","html_url":"https://github.com/bkvarda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":153686285,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTM2ODYyODU=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"bkvarda/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bkvarda","id":6834678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzQ2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6834678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda","html_url":"https://github.com/bkvarda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bkvarda/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

config parser it was impossible\r\nto set it as None, it would come through as `\"\"`, which is not the same\r\n(to the ldap3 lib) as not providing a password.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: no tests -hard to test, but tested by author of Jira ticket.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3295\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen user decides to use TLS/SSL encryption for DaskExecutor communications, `Distributed.Security` object will be created.\r\n\r\nHowever, argument `require_encryption` is missed to be set to `True` (its default value is `False`).\r\n\r\nThis may fail the TLS/SSL encryption setting-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-03T06:43:21Z","updated_at":"2018-11-03T07:38:27Z","closed_at":"2018-11-03T07:36:25Z","merged_at":"2018-11-03T07:36:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"80a3d6ac78c5c13abb8826b9dcbe0529f60fed81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/57c6827a154b9a77db7a450a113581d81a838bb9","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:patch-7","ref":"patch-7","sha":"57c6827a154b9a77db7a450a113581d81a838bb9","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nClasses and methods should be documented.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3287) \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhile running a single unit test of some Dataproc operator, I've spotted that database clean-up code in `tests.core` module is triggered, which should not take place since I run unit test in a completely different place.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nFixing existing tests. Like `test_task_fail_duration`, it was failing if ran second time without proper DB cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.
