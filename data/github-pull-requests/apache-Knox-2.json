What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduced new metadata called `type`, this can be any of:\r\n- JWT (default)\r\n- KNOXSSO_COOKIE\r\n- CLIENT_ID\r\n\r\nThe default is `JWT`. The `KNOXSSO_COOKIE` is set when tokens are participating in KNOX SSO Cookie management we introduced in #797 .\r\n`CLIENT_ID` can be set via a KnoxToken API call with metadata name, `type`. For instance:\r\n```\r\ncurl -iku admin:admin-password https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/knoxtoken/api/v2/token?md_type=CLIENT_ID\r\n```\r\nThe Token Management UI is updated: instead of adding new columns per type, only a one column exists and the relevant type icon is displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan build/unit tests and deployed Knox. Then I \r\n- generated a regular JWT token on the Token Generation UI\r\n- enabled the KnoxSSO cookie management feature and re-logged in to Knox Home\r\n- used the above `curl` request to generate a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplemented what's described in [KNOX-3019](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KNOX-3019):\r\n- if `knox.token.exp.max-lifetime` is set to a negative value, tokens can be renewed without a maximum lifetime check\r\n- only non-expired tokens can be renewed\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated current and added new JUnit

this test proves, setting the maximum lifetime allows token renewal operations as many times as one needs until the token was not expired. The original token expiration was `2024-03-13T11:10:39`, and I could extend that up until `2024-03-13T11:12:50` (more than 2 minutes) easily.","created_at":"2024-03-13T11:02:25Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T12:18:47Z","closed_at":"2024-03-13T12:18:43Z","merged_at":"2024-03-13T12:18:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"c098afaec3a181d8a5d8d5f25a61526d4b608a8b","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"lmccay","id":2303672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDM2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2303672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay","html_url":"https://github.com/lmccay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1870962954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODcwOTYyOTU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/knoxtoken","name":"knoxtoken","color":"a88be8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/351b0a0b930d810150471878f1fb7aee16eaa726","head":{"label":"smolnar82:KNOX-3019","ref":"KNOX-3019","sha":"351b0a0b930d810150471878f1fb7aee16eaa726","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.gi

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `Token Management` and `Token Generation` UIs are updated in a way such that they display `Never expires` in case a token never expires (that is, if the token's expiration is set to a negative number).\r\nMoreover, the automated token eviction logic is modified to never remove those tokens from the underlying token state backend.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing unit tests to cover the token eviction logic change and ran manual testing on the UI.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1776\" alt=\"Screenshot

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTwo changes on the `Token Generation UI`:\r\n- if the `homepage` topology is configured with `Unlimited token lifetime`, the lifetime adjustment popup will not shown. The logic was there before, this was a casting issue between strings and numbers in the JS code.\r\n- added an `exclamation` icon to better emphasize the `Unlimited lifetime` setting on the UI.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and confirmed that the popup is no longer displayed when creating a 1-year token with `Unlimited lifetime` settings. The new exclamation mark is shown as expected (tested with and without the `-1` TTL).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1747\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 14 13 13\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding support for integrations to Knox proxied services and APIs via OAuth style cllient credentials flow. This allows an integration that is provided a CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to authenticate to Knox and directly access proxied services with those or exchange those credentials for short lived JWT based access, id and refresh tokens.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces only the acceptance of the Knox TokenID and Passcode tokens as CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET in a standard OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow request body. This body will contain the following params:\r\n\r\n1. grant_type and it will be \"client_credentials\"\r\n2. client_id which will be the KnoxToken tokenId or KnoxID\r\n3. client_secret which will be the passcode token for which we store the hash\r\n\r\nAuthentication using this flow will result in the effective user being what is provided as the CLIENT_ID.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change proposes a new authorization provider `PathAclsAuthz` that authorized based on request path. Authorization is done based on path matching similar to rewrite rules.\r\n\r\nFormat is very similar to  AclsAuthz provider with an addition of path. The format is \r\n`{path};{users};{groups}:{ips}`\r\nOne important thing to note here is that the path is not plural, there has to be one and only one path defined. \r\n\r\nIn case one wants multiple paths they can define multiple rules with rule name as a parameter e.g. \r\nKNOXTOKEN.{rule_name}.path.acl\r\n\r\n_These are special cases for rule names_\r\nThis rule will be applied to ALL services defined in the topology\r\n```\r\n           <param>\r\n                <name>path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/api/**;admin;*;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis rule will be applied to only the service {service_name}\r\n```\r\n           <param>\r\n                <name>{service_name}.path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/api/**;admin;*;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n```\r\n\r\nALL of these rules will be applied to service {service_name}. \r\n_NOTE_: {rule_1} and {rule_2} can be any unique names.\r\n```\r\n           <param>\r\n                <name>{service_name}.{rule_1}.path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/api/**;admin;*;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>{service_name}.{rule_2}.path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/api/**;admin;*;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing are concrete examples of the the above rules:\r\n\r\n1. This rule will be applied to ALL services defined in the topology\r\n\r\n```\r\n       <provider>\r\n            <role>authorization</role>\r\n            <name>PathAclsAuthz</name>\r\n            <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/api/**;admin;*;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n        </provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. This rule will be applied to only to KNOXTOKEN service\r\n\r\n```\r\n       <provider>\r\n            <role>authorization</role>\r\n            <name>PathAclsAuthz</name>\r\n            <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>KNOXTOKEN.path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/api/**;admin;*;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n        </provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. All of these rules will be applied to only to KNOXTOKEN service\r\n\r\n```\r\n       <provider>\r\n            <role>authorization</role>\r\n            <name>PathAclsAuthz</name>\r\n            <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>KNOXTOKEN.rule_1.path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/api/**;admin;*;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>KNOXTOKEN.rule_2.path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/foo/**;knox;*;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>KNOXTOKEN.rule_3.path.acl</name>\r\n                <value>https://*:*/**/knoxtoken/bar/**;sam;admin;*</value> \r\n            </param>\r\n        </provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested locally\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -ivku admin:admin-password https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/knoxtoken/api/v1/token\r\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8443...\r\n* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8443 (#0)\r\n* ALPN: offers h2,http/1.1\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Encrypted Extensions (8):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, CERT verify (15):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\r\n* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n* ALPN: server did not agree on a protocol.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- YARNUI/yarn/outbound/node3 rule rewrites the https schemes to http\r\n- To fix the issue we skip this rule in case if the schema is https\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- unit tests\r\n- manually deployed a cluster and verified the url stays https\r\n   - run MapReduce job\r\n   - after that i checked the ResourceManager UI behind Knox\r\n   - verified the scheme stayed https which links to the NodeManager (befor the change it was http cause the node3 rule)\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore my change, any time I ran a KnoxCLI command I saw the following warning messages wrt. there are multiple SLF4J bindings on the classpath:\r\n```\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh create-master --master gateway\r\nSLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\r\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/sandormolnar/test/knoxGateway/bin/../dep/log4j-slf4j-impl-2.17.1.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/sandormolnar/test/knoxGateway/bin/../dep/logback-classic-1.2.10.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.\r\nSLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.apache.logging.slf4j.Log4jLoggerFactory]\r\nMaster secret has been persisted to disk.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also confirmed that we have had `ch.qos.logback:logback-[core-classic]:jar:1.2.10` on Maven's dependency tree multiple times.\r\n```\r\n$ mvn dependency:tree | grep '^.*logback.*1.2.10.*$' | wc -l\r\n      66\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Running the previous `mvn:dependencyTree` command:\r\n```\r\n$ mvn dependency:tree | grep '^.*logback.*1.2.10.*$' | wc -l\r\n       0\r\n```\r\n2. Rebuilt and redeployed Knox, then ran the `create-master` command:\r\n```\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh create-master --master gateway\r\nMaster secret has been persisted to disk.\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-27T11:18:54Z","updated_at":"2024-02-27T11:44:49Z","closed_at":"2024-02-27T11:44:46Z","merged_at":"2024-02-27T11:44:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1d9bb729af006f45e70311ac5746277fe03760f","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1710935438,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzEwOTM1NDM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/dependencies","name":"dependencies","color":"0366d6","default":false,"description":"Pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs explained in [KNOX-3008](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KNOX-3008), the following changes were implemented in this PR:\r\n- the hostname where the Knox Gateway instance is running is added in the `General Proxy Information' section on the Knox Home page\r\n- end-users can configure a custom banner text displayed on the top banner between the Knox logo and the logged-in user name. The new gateway-level configuration name is `gateway.ui.banner.text` and defaults to an `empty string`. Administrators can set this configuration to simple text, or they can also set HTML style elements to match their needs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with the following `gateway-site.xml` settings:\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this change the recently added KnoxSSO Cookie invalidation feature is extended like this:\r\n- new token metadata is saved for KnoxSSO cookie called `lastUsedAt`\r\n- the value of this token metadata is updated upon every successful KnoxSSO cookie verification. Therefore UI services that use KnoxSSO go through token verification every time they contact the Knox Gateway. When that verification succeeds, we know the KnoxSSO cookie was in use so that we can actualize the value.\r\n- another new config was introduced on the topology level: `sso.idle.timeout.seconds`. The default value of this config is `-1`, meaning the idleness check should be ignored when verifying KnoxSSO cookies. This parameter should be added in the `SSOCookieProvider` federation filter block to enable the idle timeout enforcement.\r\n- if the value of `sso.idle.timeout.seconds` is greater than `0`, KnoxSSO verification flow tests if the time from the previously saved `lastUsedAt` event exceeded the configured idle timeout. If that's true, the request is rejected and treated the same way as the KnoxSSO cookie was disabled: removes the cookie and redirects the browser to the login page (or to `knox.global.logout.page.url`, if it was configured).\r\n\r\nThe following is very important to emphasize:\r\n- This new feature does NOT include the usual UI pop-up approach (like when the end-user is informed about being idle too long)\r\n- It's also worth mentioning the idleness measurement solely depends on backend activities through the KnoxSSO Cookie federation filter and does NOT take any client-side action (such as scrolling on the page, client-side pagination, etc..) into account.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new JUnit test cases to test SSO cookie idleness. Apart from unit testing, I conducted the following E2E test run:\r\n\r\n_Pre-requisites:_\r\n1. Updated the `SSOCookieProvider` in the `homepage` and `manager` topologies:\r\n```\r\n      <provider>\r\n         <role>federation</role>\r\n         <name>SSOCookieProvider</name>\r\n         <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n         <param>\r\n            <name>knox.token.exp.server-managed</name>\r\n            <value>true</value>\r\n         </param>\r\n         <param>\r\n            <name>sso.idle.timeout.seconds</name>\r\n            <value>120</value>\r\n         </param>\r\n      </provider>\r\n```\r\n2. Enabled KnoxSSO cookie validation in the `knoxsso` topology:\r\n```\r\n        <param>\r\n            <!-- since 2.1.0: KnoxSSO cookie validation -->\r\n            <name>knox.token.exp.server-managed</name>\r\n            <value>true</value>\r\n        </param>\r\n```\r\n3. Configured the Knox Gateway to use my local PostgreSQL DB as the token backend:\r\n```\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.tokenstate.impl</name>\r\n        <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.services.token.impl.JDBCTokenStateService</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n     <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.database.type</name>\r\n        <value>postgresql</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.database.connection.url</name>\r\n        <value>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres?user=***</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Test steps:_\r\n\r\nWhen the Knox Gateway started, I logged into the Knox Home page and confirmed that the KnoxSSO cookie was saved in the DB:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select * from knox_tokens kt, knox_token_metadata meta where kt.token_id = meta.token_id;\r\n               token_id               |  issue_time   |  expiration   | max_lifetime  |               token_id               |    md_name    |         md_value         \r\n--------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+--------------------------\r\n c6a2eb3e-6d43-4ffb-a779-7d7a48de0a69 | 1706796806265 | 1706883206000 | 1707401606265 | c6a2eb3e-6d43-4ffb-a779-7d7a48de0a69 | userName      | admin\r\n c6a2eb3e-6d43-4ffb-a779-7d7a48de0a69 | 1706796806265 | 1706883206000 | 1707401606265 | c6a2eb3e-6d43-4ffb-a779-7d7a48de0a69 | knoxSSOCookie | true\r\n c6a2eb3e-6d43-4ffb-a779-7d7a48de0a69 | 1706796806265 | 1706883206000 | 1707401606265 | c6a2eb3e-6d43-4ffb-a779-7d7a48de0a69 | enabled       | true\r\n c6a2eb3e-6d43-4ffb-a779-7d7a48de0a69 | 1706796806265 | 1706883206000 | 1707401606265 | c6a2eb3e-6d43-4ffb-a779-7d7a48de0a69 | lastUsedAt    | 2024-02-01T14:13:27.259Z\r\n(4 rows)\r\n```\r\nThis is what I had in the logs:\r\n```\r\n2024-02-01 15:13:26,343 fd43e7fa-97f3-4510-82d8-9762bba0c777 INFO  service.knoxsso (WebSSOResource.java:saveToken(455)) -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are two important pieces of this PR:\r\n1. the `getTopologies` REST API endpoint in `KnoxMetadataResource` was modified in a way such that it includes only one item per service role (IMPALAUI, WEBHDFS, HUE, HBASEUI, etc...) with a list of service URLs from now on. In previous versions it was different: the response had `N` items per service role with a unique service URL.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -iku admin:admin-password

The Knox Home page is also modified: if a service role has more than one service URL, the number of instances is visible next to the service role name within the `Topologies` section. Clicking the service icon or the service name will result in a modal window that lists all instances of the given service role.\r\nI also added a filter box where end-users can search by hostname and/or port to make it easier for them to narrow down those instances precisely for what they are looking for.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1775\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-31 at 10 56 22\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs described in [KNOX-3001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KNOX-3001), if the shared provider, descriptor, service, or application originally contains XML-escaped values, Knox will persist topologies in a way such that those already escaped values become doubly-escaped.\r\nTo avoid this issue the following was implemented:\r\n- unescape the value first\r\n- escape the unescaped result\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI updated existing JUnit tests where a shared provider config contains both a single `&` and an escaped `&amp;` in its .json file. The test then proves the generated XML is parsed properly and contains the desired `&` value in the SAX document.\r\n\r\nI also ran integration tests with the following shared-provider and descriptor files:\r\n```\r\n$ cat conf/shared-providers/smolnar.json \r\n{\r\n  \"providers\" : [ {\r\n    \"role\" : \"webappsec\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"WebAppSec\",\r\n    \"enabled\" : true,\r\n    \"params\" : {\r\n      \"xframe.options.enabled\" : \"true\"\r\n    }\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"role\" : \"authentication\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"ShiroProvider\",\r\n    \"enabled\" : true,\r\n    \"params\" : {\r\n      \"main.ldapContextFactory\" : \"org.apache.knox.gateway.shirorealm.KnoxLdapContextFactory\",\r\n      \"main.ldapRealm\" : \"org.apache.knox.gateway.shirorealm.KnoxLdapRealm\",\r\n      \"main.ldapRealm.authenticationCachingEnabled\" : \"false\",\r\n      \"main.ldapRealm.contextFactory\" : \"$ldapContextFactory\",\r\n      \"main.ldapRealm.contextFactory.authenticationMechanism\" : \"simple\",\r\n      \"main.ldapRealm.contextFactory.url\" : \"ldap://localhost:33389\",\r\n      \"main.ldapRealm.userDnTemplate\" : \"uid=0ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\",\r\n      \"main.ldapRealm.userSearchFilter\" : \"(&(&amp;(objectclass=person)(sAMAccountName={0}))(|(memberOf=CN=SecXX-users,OU=ManagedGroups,OU=Groups,OU=XX,OU=xx,DC=xx,DC=int)(memberOf=CN=SecXX-rls-serviceuser,OU=ManagedGroups,OU=Groups,OU=XX,OU=xx,DC=xx,DC=int)))\",\r\n      \"redirectToUrl\" : \"/${GATEWAY_PATH}/knoxsso/knoxauth/login.html\",\r\n      \"restrictedCookies\" : \"rememberme,WWW-Authenticate\",\r\n      \"sessionTimeout\" : \"30\",\r\n      \"urls./**\" : \"authcBasic\"\r\n    }\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"role\" : \"identity-assertion\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"Default\",\r\n    \"enabled\" : true,\r\n    \"params\" : { }\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"readOnly\" : true\r\n}\r\n\r\n$ cat conf/descriptors/smolnar.json \r\n{\r\n   \"provider-config-ref\": \"smolnar\",\r\n   \"services\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"KNOXSSO\",\r\n        \"params\": {\r\n            \"knoxsso.token.ttl\": \"86400000\",\r\n            \"knoxsso.token.sigalg\": \"\",\r\n            \"knoxsso.redirect.whitelist.regex\": \"^https?:\\\\/\\\\/(.*smolnar\\\\.root\\\\.xyz\\\\.com)(?::[0-9]+)?(?:\\\\/.*)?$\"\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   ],\r\n   \"applications\": [\r\n     {\r\n       \"name\": \"knoxauth\"\r\n     }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I confirmed that the generated topology is in good shape:\r\n```\r\n$ cat conf/topologies/smolnar.xml \r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<!--==============================================-->\r\n<!-- DO NOT EDIT.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen there are multiple providers in one topology, knox gets the first one, without checking if it's enabled or disabled.\r\n\r\nTherefore

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nActual cluster configuration change monitoring should not happen until the Knox Gateway is fully up and running and all the topologies are deployed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing unit tests and added a new test case to cover this new functionality. Apart from this, I also conducted an E2E test round on a live CM cluster (I set the `gateway.cluster.config.monitor.cm.interval` to `5` to make sure we see config monitor attempts every 5 seconds).\r\nAfter I restarted Knox I confirmed the feature is working:\r\n```\r\n2024-01-03 12:55:15,551  INFO  knox.gateway (GatewayServer.java:startGateway(389)) - Starting gateway...\r\n...\r\n2024-01-03 12:55:15,607  INFO  discovery.cm (PollingConfigurationAnalyzer.java:run(203)) - Started ClouderaManager cluster configuration monitor (checking every 5 seconds)\r\n2024-01-03 12:55:15,607  INFO  knox.gateway (GatewayStatusService.java:status(45)) - Checking gateway status.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplemented the changes I listed in [KNOX-2990](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KNOX-2990):\r\n\r\n- deprecated the following TSS implementations:\r\n  - AliasBasedTokenStateService\r\n  - ZookeeperTokenStateService\r\n  - JournalBasedTokenStateService\r\n- implemented a DerbyDB storage that stores tokens in `$DATA_DIR/security/tokens` (this time it's not yet encrypted)\r\n- file permissions are set on that folder to `700` (only the owner can access it)\r\n- changed the default implementation in `TokenStateServiceFactory` to the new DerbyDatabaseTSS\r\n- implemenedt a new KnoxCLI command that migrates existing tokens from credential stores to any JDBC-based TSS backend (tested it with the new DerbyDB TSS; see below)\r\n- integrated this new KnoxCLI command in a way such that it runs when Knox Gateway is started: if token management is enabled, and the configured TSS implementation is a migration target (currently it's true for any JDBC-based TSS implementation)\r\n- added some new `gateway-site.xml` properties:\r\n  - `gateway.knox.token.migration.skip `: ensures that the previous automated step can be controlled (E.g. in case of unforeseen errors it can be turned off). Defaults\r\n  - `gateway.knox.token.migration.archive.tokens `: indicates if migrated tokesn should be archived in another credential store called `__tokens`. Defaults to `false`.\r\n  - `gateway.knox.token.migration.include.expired.tokens`: whether expired tokens should be migrated or skipped. Defaults to `false`.\r\n  - `gateway.knox.token.migration.verbose`: if true, migrated/skipped tokens are added in the `[gateway|knoxcli].log` and, optionally, on the STDOUT (when running the KnoxCLI tool manually). Defaults to `true`, because it's very useful to have the chancee to cross-reference token IDs in case of error debugging.\r\n  - `gateway.knox.token.migration.progress.count`: the number of tokens after the token migration tool displays progress in the logs and, optionally, on the STDOUT.\r\n- modified the token generation page to accept the new DerbyDB TSS.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nConfigured Knox to have the `AliasBasedTSS` as the token state backend and to allow unlimited token creation:\r\n```\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.tokenstate.impl</name>\r\n        <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.services.token.impl.AliasBasedTokenStateService</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.knox.token.limit.per.user</name>\r\n        <value>-1</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n```\r\nGenerated 456 tokens with random expiration times (456x4=1824 aliases) then stopped the Knox GW (to avoid the reaper thread removing expired tokens).\r\n```\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh list-alias | grep \"items\"\r\n    1827\r\n```\r\nExecuted the new KnoxCLI command to confirm it only migrates anything if the configured backend allows token migration:\r\n```\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh migrate-tokens --progressCount 15 --archiveMigrated true\r\nThis tool is meant to migrate tokens into a JDBC TokenStateService backend. However, the currently configured one (org.apache.knox.gateway.services.token.impl.AliasBasedTokenStateService) does not fulfill this requirement!\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore running the new KnoxLCI command again, I commented out the `gateway.service.tokenstate.impl` param in `gateway-site.xml` => the new default, DerbyDBTSS, was in place.\r\n\r\nExecuted the command again:\r\n```\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh migrate-tokens --progressCount 15 --archiveMigrated true > ~/migrationResultWithArchival.txt\r\n\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh list-alias | grep items\r\n3 items.\r\n\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh list-alias --cluster __tokens | grep items\r\n1824 items.\r\n\r\n$ cat ~/migrationResultWithArchival.txt \r\nMigrating tokens from __gateway credential store into the configured TokenStateService backend...\r\nLoading token aliases from the __gateway credential store. This could take a while.\r\nToken aliased loaded in 178741 milliseconds\r\nProcessed 15 tokens in 102 milliseconds\r\nProcessed 30 tokens in 174 milliseconds\r\n...\r\nProcessed 450 tokens in 2191 milliseconds\r\nProcessed 456 tokens in 2202 milliseconds\r\nArchiving token aliases in the __tokens credential store...\r\nArchived token related aliases in the __tokens credential store in 141849 millsieconds \r\nRemoving token aliases from the __gateway credential store...\r\nRemoved token related aliases from the __gateway credential store in 38 milliseconds\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\nRepeated the generate/migration step, but this time without token archival:\r\n```\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh migrate-tokens --progressCount 15 > ~/migrationResultWithoutArchival.txt\r\n\r\n$ cat ~/migrationResultWithoutArchival.txt \r\nMigrating tokens from __gateway credential store into the configured TokenStateService backend...\r\nLoading token aliases from the __gateway credential store. This could take a while.\r\nToken aliased loaded in 182497 milliseconds\r\nProcessed 15 tokens in 160 milliseconds\r\nProcessed 30 tokens in 271 milliseconds\r\n...\r\nProcessed 456 tokens in 1677 milliseconds\r\nRemoving token aliases from the __gateway credential store...\r\nRemoved token related aliases from the __gateway credential store in 61 milliseconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI also tested the token migration tool integration during the Knox Gateway startup. I removed the previously created data/security/tokens folder, switched to AliasBasedTSS and created another 456 tokens. Then switched back to the default DerbyDBTSS and started the Knox GW. I confirmed the `$SECURITY_DIR/tokens` was created with the proper file permissions:\r\n```\r\nls -al data/security/\r\ntotal 16\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 sandormolnar  staff   192 Dec 15 15:26 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   8 sandormolnar  staff   256 Dec 15 15:27 ..\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  12 sandormolnar  staff   384 Dec 14 19:43 keystores\r\n-rw-------   1 sandormolnar  staff   125 Dec  5 16:05 master\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 sandormolnar  staff  2746 Dec 15 15:27 registry\r\ndrwx------   9 sandormolnar  staff   288 Dec 15 15:27 tokens\r\n```\r\nI also checked if the automated token migration tool works as expected:\r\n```\r\n2023-12-15 15:32:35,742  INFO  knox.gateway (GatewayServer.java:logSysProp(226)) - System Property: user.name=sandormolnar\r\n2023-12-15 15:32:35,749  INFO  knox.gateway (GatewayServer.java:logSysProp(226)) - System Property: user.dir=/Users/sandormolnar/test/knoxGateway\r\n2023-12-15 15:32:35,749  INFO  knox.gateway (GatewayServer.java:logSysProp(226)) - System Property: java.runtime.name=OpenJDK Runtime Environment\r\n2023-12-15 15:32:35,750  INFO  knox.gateway (GatewayServer.java:logSysProp(226)) - System Property: java.runtime.version=1.8.0_282-bre_2021_01_20_16_37-b00\r\n2023-12-15 15:32:35,750  INFO  knox.gateway (GatewayServer.java:logSysProp(226)) - System Property: java.home=/usr/local/Cellar/openjdk@8/1.8.0+282/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/jre\r\n...\r\n2023-12-15 15:32:38,960  INFO  knox.gateway (AbstractServiceFactory.java:logServiceUsage(103)) - Using org.apache.knox.gateway.services.token.impl.DerbyDBTokenStateService implementation for TokenStateService\r\n...\r\n2023-12-15 15:32:41,930  INFO  knox.gateway (AbstractGatewayServices.java:start(60)) - Starting service: org.apache.knox.gateway.services.token.impl.DerbyDBTokenStateService\r\n2023-12-15 15:32:41,935  INFO  token.state (TokenMigrationTool.java:log(115)) - Loading token aliases from the __gateway credential store.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy incorporating the language which was introduced for the virtual group mapping, identity providers now support a flexible way to combine the functionality of different kind of principal mappings (e.g.: RegEx, Concat, Switch Case, ..).\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nThe `indentity-assertion` provider supports a `expression.principal.mapping` config parameter that can contain an arbitrary expression. This expression is expected to return a String. This string will be the new, mapped principal.\r\n\r\nFor example, every user will be mapped to `jozsi`\r\n\r\n```\r\n<param>\r\n   <name>expression.principal.mapping</name>\r\n   <value>'jozsi'</value>\r\n</param>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFunction calls can be used to make transformations on the original principal\r\n\r\n```\r\n<param>\r\n   <name>expression.principal.mapping</name>\r\n   <value>(uppercase username)</value>\r\n</param>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will convert all users to their uppercase variant.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<param>\r\n   <name>expression.principal.mapping</name>\r\n   <value>(concat 'prefix_' username)</value>\r\n</param>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will prepend `prefix_` in front of the username.\r\n\r\nThe combination of both:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<param>\r\n   <name>expression.principal.mapping</name>\r\n   <value>(uppercase (concat 'prefix_' username))</value>\r\n</param>\r\n```\r\n\r\nE.g.: `admin` will become `PREFIX_ADMIN`\r\n\r\nThe functionality of the Regex identity assertion provider is exposed via a `regex-template` function.\r\n\r\nE.g.:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(regex-template 'prefix_user-1_suffix' 'prefix_(\\w+)\\-(\\d)_suffix' '{1}.{2}')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will map `prefix_user-1_suffix` to `user.1`\r\n\r\nFew other functions were added, like `index-of`, `strlen`, `substr`, `starts-with`, `ends-with`.\r\n\r\nA new special form was also introduced to support `if` and `if else`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nConstant user:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<provider>\r\n         <role>identity-assertion</role>\r\n         <name>Default</name>\r\n         <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n         <param>\r\n              <name>expression.principal.mapping</name>\r\n              <value>'jozsi'</value>\r\n         </param>\r\n</provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl -u admin:admin-password -k https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/hive\r\n$ tail -n1 logs/gateway-audit.log \r\n23/11/09 11:29:25 ||ba8f6eb6-aa40-4a06-8677-c6c0b1195208|audit|[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]|HIVE|admin|jozsi||access|uri|/gateway/sandbox/hive|failure|\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Invalid result:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(strlen username)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-11-09 11:30:57,089 3d0c2c25-9b90-4469-bf95-11d7e7473011 WARN  knox.gateway (CommonIdentityAssertionFilter.java:evalAdvancedPrincipalMapping(270)) - Invalid result: 5.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdated the `api/v1/sessioninfo` REST API endpoint in `SessionResouce` in a way such that it can generate a `logoutPageUrl` (used by the application logout link in Knox's logout flow) with `profile` and `topologies` query parameters in the `originalUrl` part.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsing `curl`:\r\n\r\n1. Without any query params:\r\n```\r\n$ curl -ik --cookie \"hadoop-jwt=eyJra...APA\" -X GET \"https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/session/api/v1/sessioninfo\"\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2023 10:47:30 GMT\r\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\r\nX-XSS-Protection: 1;mode=block\r\nContent-Type: application/xml\r\nContent-Length: 574\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<sessioninfo>\r\n   <user>admin</user>\r\n   <logoutUrl>https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/knoxssout/api/v1/webssout</logoutUrl>\r\n   <logoutPageUrl>https://localhost:8443/gateway/knoxsso/knoxauth/logout.jsp?originalUrl=https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/home</logoutPageUrl>\r\n   <globalLogoutPageUrl>https://dev-p8gzwjyj66yvfble.eu.auth0.com/oidc/logout</globalLogoutPageUrl>\r\n   <canSeeAllTokens>true</canSeeAllTokens>\r\n   <currentKnoxSsoCookieTokenId>40005574-61f2-4507-aa9f-0171b787ed4c</currentKnoxSsoCookieTokenId>\r\n</sessioninfo>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

Only with the `logoutPageTopologies` param:\r\n```\r\n$ curl -ik --cookie \"hadoop-jwt=eyJra...APA\" -X GET \"https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/session/api/v1/sessioninfo?logoutPageTopologies=sandbox\"\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2023 10:48:52 GMT\r\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\r\nX-XSS-Protection: 1;mode=block\r\nContent-Type: application/xml\r\nContent-Length: 593\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<sessioninfo>\r\n   <user>admin</user>\r\n   <logoutUrl>https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/knoxssout/api/v1/webssout</logoutUrl>\r\n   <logoutPageUrl>https://localhost:8443/gateway/knoxsso/knoxauth/logout.jsp?originalUrl=https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/home%3Ftopologies=sandbox</logoutPageUrl>\r\n   <globalLogoutPageUrl>https://dev-p8gzwjyj66yvfble.eu.auth0.com/oidc/logout</globalLogoutPageUrl>\r\n   <canSeeAllTokens>true</canSeeAllTokens>\r\n   <currentKnoxSsoCookieTokenId>40005574-61f2-4507-aa9f-0171b787ed4c</currentKnoxSsoCookieTokenId>\r\n</sessioninfo>\r\n```\r\n4. Both with 'logoutPageProfile' and `logoutPageTopologies` params:\r\n```\r\n$ curl -ik --cookie \"hadoop-jwt=eyJra...APA\" -X GET \"https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/session/api/v1/sessioninfo?logoutPageTopologies=sandbox&logoutPageProfile=full\"\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2023 08:07:26 GMT\r\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\r\nX-XSS-Protection: 1;mode=block\r\nContent-Type: application/xml\r\nContent-Length: 610\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<sessioninfo>\r\n   <user>admin</user>\r\n   <logoutUrl>https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/knoxssout/api/v1/webssout</logoutUrl>\r\n   <logoutPageUrl>https://localhost:8443/gateway/knoxsso/knoxauth/logout.jsp?originalUrl=https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/home%3Fprofile=full%26topologies=sandbox</logoutPageUrl>\r\n   <globalLogoutPageUrl>https://dev-p8gzwjyj66yvfble.eu.auth0.com/oidc/logout</globalLogoutPageUrl>\r\n   <canSeeAllTokens>true</canSeeAllTokens>\r\n   <currentKnoxSsoCookieTokenId>40005574-61f2-4507-aa9f-0171b787ed4c</currentKnoxSsoCookieTokenId>\r\n</sessioninfo>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tested the entire flow by temporarily modifying the `home` application. I updated the [sessionUrl](https://github.com/apache/knox/blob/master/knox-homepage-ui/home/app/homepage.service.ts#L33) variable:\r\n```\r\nsessionUrl = this.topologyContext + 'session/api/v1/sessioninfo'\r\n```\r\nbecame\r\n```\r\nsessionUrl = this.topologyContext + 'session/api/v1/sessioninfo?logoutPageProfile=token&logoutPageTopologies=sandbox'\r\n```\r\nAfter I redeployed Knox I confirmed that I got the correct link on the logout page and after clicking the `Return to Application` link and logging in again, the given query parameters were applied.\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen end-users log out from the application (using the logout button on the Knox Home page), the KnoxSSO cookie is removed from the token state service too (if it was configured earlier).\r\nI also made a small, but useful change on the Token Management UI: `current` KnoxSSO cookie, bound to the current session, is shown in

page in a regular browser window\r\n2. logged into the Knox Token Management page in an incognito browser window\r\n3. logged out from the Knox Home page in the incognito window\r\n4. logged in again

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nModified the logic used for calculating the token limit per user in a way such that it ignores the previously generated KnoxSSO cookies. That is, a user can have as many KnoxSSO cookies as they want, but regular tokens are still limited.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated JUnit tests and executed manual testing:\r\n\r\n1. Kept the default token limit per user = 10\r\n2. I had three different sessions in different browsers as the `admin` user\r\n3. Disabled one session\r\n4. In one of the remaining sessions generated 10 tokens successfully (please note even the 8th, 9th, and 10th tokens were generated despite the fact I already had 3 KnoxSSO tokens for the same user)\r\n5. The 11th token generation failed as expected\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1779\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 13 24 10\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf cloudera manager legacy mode is turned off then certain hdfs config values are moved under the CORE_SETTINGS service.\r\n\r\nWhen the service model generator fetches `hdfs_hadoop_ssl_enabled` it will find a null value (since the real config is under CORE_SETTINGS) and it will generate a non-ssl URL even despite SSL is enabled.\r\n\r\nAffected serives: hdfs ui, job history ui, yarn ui.\r\n\r\n[Affected config properties](https://docs.cloudera.com/cloudera-manager/7.9.5/managing-clusters/topics/cm-core-configuration-paramters-migrated.html                    \r\n): only `hdfs_hadoop_ssl_enabled`\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn phase II, the following features are implemented:\r\n- Pre-configured users can see all tokens on the Token Management page.\r\n- End-users can execute batch operations on selected Knox Tokens.\r\n- Allowing end-users to show/hide previously disabled KnoxSSO Cookies on the Token Management page.\r\n\r\nThere is a new Gateway-level configuration that controls who can see all tokens on the Token Management UI:\r\n```\r\n     <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.knox.token.management.users.can.see.all.tokens</name>\r\n        <value>admin</value>\r\n        <description>A comma-separated list of user names who can see all tokens on the Token Management page</description>\r\n    </property>\r\n```\r\nOOTB, the `admin` user acts as the superuser who has the power of controlling tokens created for others. The rest of the users can only see their own tokens only (impersonated or not).\r\n\r\nThis is how the Token Management UI looks like after my changes:\r\n<img width=\"1786\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-06 at 10 06 44\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/knox/assets/34065904/304317b0-d23d-4b23-9f40-629fc9d96b2d\">\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is only one table (compared to the previous tables of own/impersonated tokens), where all the information is displayed in a compact form:\r\n- Each row starts with a selection checkbox for batch operations (except for disabled KnoxSSO cookies, as there is no point in doing anything with them)\r\n- The disabled token's `Token ID` value is shown in `orange`\r\n- `Username` indicates the user for whom the token is created for\r\n- `Impersonated` is a `boolean` flag indicating if this is an impersonated token:\r\n  - `green check`: yes, this is impersonated. You'll see the user who created the token under the icon\r\n  - `red cross`: no, this is not an impersonated token\r\n- `KnoxSSO` is another `boolean` flag that indicates if this token is created by the `KNOXSSO` service if the feature was enabled\r\n  - `green check`: yes, this is KnoxSSO cookie (token)\r\n  - `red cross`: no, this is not a KnoxSSO cookie (it was created by a regular token API call or on the Token Generation page)\r\n- In the `Actions` column you will see\r\n  - the enable/disable/revoke actions are visible for impersonated tokens too\r\n  - KnoxSSO cookies cannot be revoked nor re-enabled\r\n  \r\nBatch operations:\r\n- when at least one token is selected, we show the following buttons under the table:\r\n  - `Disable Selected Tokens`: when executed, all the selected tokens become disabled (if they were disabled originally, they will remain disabled)\r\n  - `Enable Selected Tokens`: when executed, all the selected tokens become enabled (if they were enabled originally, they will remain enabled)\r\n  - `Revoke Selected Tokens`: when executed, all the selected tokens will be revoked. Please note this option is shown only, if there is no KnoxSSO cookie (token) selected (i.e. batch revocation only works with regular tokens).\r\n\r\nToggles:\r\n- `Show Disabled KnoxSSO Cookies`: this is `true` by default. Since disabled KnoxSSO cookies remain in the underlying token state service until they expire, it may bother users to see them in the tokens table. Flipping this toggle button helps to hide them.\r\n- `Show My Tokens Only`: this toggle button is only visible to users, who can see all tokens. By default, this is `false`. Enabling it will filter the tokens table in a way such that it will contain tokens only that were generated for the logged in user (impersonated or not).\r\n\r\nToken API changes:\r\n- new API endpoints, `enableTokens` and `disableTokens`, to enable/disable tokens in one batch. Sample `curl` command:\r\n```\r\ncurl -iku admin:admin-password -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '[\"62445b09-adb3-4f18-a89d-e5091d87b815\",\"c2ee4646-b695-49af-8910-371ae40f6f75\",\"10c46471-0ff0-4e47-8dac-7c226255d80f\"]' -X PUT https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/knoxtoken/api/v1/token/disableTokens\r\n```\r\nWhen this API is used, the state check (if it's already enabled/disabled) is not in use. That is, you can include already enabled/disabled tokens in your batch operation.\r\n\r\n-  new API endpoint, `revokeTokens`, to revoke tokens in one batch. Sample `curl` command:\r\n```\r\ncurl -iku admin:admin-password -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '[\"62445b09-adb3-4f18-a89d-e5091d87b815\",\"c2ee4646-b695-49af-8910-371ae40f6f75\",\"10c46471-0ff0-4e47-8dac-7c226255d80f\"]' -X DELETE https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/knoxtoken/api/v1/token/revokeTokens\r\n```\r\n\r\n- the `revoke` endpoint throws an error upon attempting to revoke a KnoxSSO cookie\r\n```\r\n$ curl -iku admin:admin-password  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d 'c236d20c-4a05-4cfa-b35e-2ba6dc451de0' -X DELETE https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/knoxtoken/api/v1/token/revoke\r\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\r\nDate: Fri, 06 Oct 2023 08:55:25 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: KNOXSESSIONID=node03e9y0cy8giy31rh00xc1mrcfx0.node0; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Secure; HttpOnly\r\nExpires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: rememberMe=deleteMe; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Max-Age=0; Expires=Thu, 05-Oct-2023 08:55:25 GMT; SameSite=lax\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nContent-Length: 113\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"revoked\": \"false\",\r\n  \"error\": \"SSO cookie (c236d20c...2ba6dc451de0) cannot not be revoked.\",\r\n  \"code\": 20\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- the `enable` endpoint throws an error upon attempting to enable a disabled KnoxSSO cookie:\r\n```\r\n$ curl -iku admin:admin-password  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '107824ab-c54d-4db3-b3b5-5c964892ad05' -X PUT https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/knoxtoken/api/v1/token/enable\r\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\nDate: Fri, 06 Oct 2023 08:57:58 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: KNOXSESSIONID=node011ejmvgcjnlpl13mchqmqjtdjc1.node0; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Secure; HttpOnly\r\nExpires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: rememberMe=deleteMe; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Max-Age=0; Expires=Thu, 05-Oct-2023 08:57:58 GMT; SameSite=lax\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nContent-Length: 107\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"setEnabledFlag\": \"false\",\r\n  \"error\": \"Disabled KnoxSSO Cookies cannot not be enabled\",\r\n  \"code\": 80\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- the `getUserTokens` endpoint changed in a way that it accepts a new boolean query parameter called `allTokens`. If the value of this param is `true`, this API returns all tokens:\r\n```\r\ncurl -iku admin:admin-password -X GET

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `KNOXSSO` service is modified in a way such that it saves the generated SSO cookie using Knox's token state service capabilities in case token management is enabled in `KNOXSSO`'s configuration (using the well-known `knox.token.exp.server-managed=true` parameter).\r\nThis is only the SSO cookie generation side of the feature. The verification side also needs to be configured the same way: the `SSOCookieProvider` configuration must have the same parameter to enable this new feature.\r\nIn addition to the save/verify changes, the Token Management page is updated:\r\n- there is only one table\r\n- the new table contains every token (own tokens, impersonated tokens, SSO cookies)\r\n- from now on, impersonated tokens can be disabled, enabled, or revoked\r\n- SSO cookies can only be disabled (=invalidated) once. The token reaper thread cleans disabled SSO cookies even if they are not expired\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested using PAM, LDAP, and PAC4J (SAML2 and OIDC) authentication mechanisms. I flipped the `knox.token.exp.server-managed` to `true` in `knoxsso`, `homepage`, and `manager` topologies.\r\nLogged into the Knox home page (contains some valid UI links in the sandbox topology) as well as opened the Token Management and Token Generation pages. I also opened a private window with the Token Management page to mimic a system administrator (a superuser who has the power to disable tokens for other users).\r\n\r\nConfirmed that I can proxy some UIs from the Knox Home page and could generate manage tokens as usual.\r\nThen, in the private window, I disabled the previously generated SSO cookie for my session in the non-private window and confirmed that I was redirected to the Knox login page or to my configured global logout redirect in case of Pac4j authentication (for this feature to work with Pac4j, the `knox.global.logout.page.url` configuration is a must-have parameter in `gateway-site.xml`).\r\n\r\nThis is how the Token Management page looks like with my new changes:\r\n<img width=\"1779\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-02 at 10 18 28\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/knox/assets/34065904/409416fb-8739-4fbb-bf05-b9e3333961a9\">\r\n\r\n**Important note**: as the commit message suggests, this is only the 1st phase of the job. In the 2nd one, two new improvements are coming:\r\n- pre-configured superusers can view tokens of others and not only theirs\r\n- batch operations should be able to be executed using the available actions to make it easier for a superuser to disable one's tokens in a round\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-29T10:04:56Z","updated_at":"2023-10-06T07:23:30Z","closed_at":"2023-10-06T07:23:26Z","merged_at":"2023-10-06T07:23:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"c49302a0f7ac27f92811d4d65cdc76da7077f5d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/98ab9dd0ec73ef95de01797b06bfe9e90e76f78b","head":{"label":"smolnar82:KNOX-2961","ref":"KNOX-2961","sha":"98ab9dd0ec73ef95de01797b06bfe9e90e76f78b","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168984130,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5ODQxMzA=","name":"knox","full_name":"smolnar82/knox","private":false,"owner":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82/knox","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter scaling up and down, the service list in the topologies should be regenerated. For example, if the user adds a new service component to a new host then the new URL should be added to the topology. Similarly if a service component is removed from a host, the URL should be deleted.\r\n\r\nOne small problem is that after adding a component, the new URL will appear in the topology right after the monitor picks up the change, even if the component is not yet started. Failover will handle this scenario. Plus this is not a new thing, since stopping a component has the same effect. But feel free to share you concerns regrading this.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that cluster config monitor is turned on in gateway-site.xml\r\n2. Add a new component (I tested it with KAFKA_BROKER) to a host\r\n3. Wait for the cluster config monitor to pick up the change\r\n4. Check the topology and see if the new URL was added\r\n\r\nDeletion event was tested
