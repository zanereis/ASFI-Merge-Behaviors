to give a given->when->than testing structure\r\nhttps://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html\r\n\r\nWhen working on adding the `verify` parameter on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/18791, i have noticed that in each test i see the following:\r\n\r\n1. `assert mock_connect.return_value == conn` -> that line did not effect the test. inherently, that test ensured that the `MagicMock` equals the `MagicMock` which did not contribute anything to the test itself\r\n2. mocking the connection -> constantly repeated so i extracted it to a function called: `get_get_connection_return_value(mock_get_connection, extra=None, password=None)`\r\n3. asserting the parameters in which the connection is called was also extracted to a function called: `assert_connection_called_with(mock_connect, auth=None, verify=True)`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Airflow 2.0 UI overhaul removed the date and seconds from the UI clock.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it is still helpful to show the date and seconds because:\r\n\r\n  - we now display `Next Run` which includes the date and seconds\r\n  - it is useful to have a clock that shows the date when trying to figure out how long ago something executed\r\n  - having the seconds visible is useful on certain occasions, such as when someone is actively waiting for the next run of a DAG to trigger\r\n\r\nOther thoughts:\r\n  - We could have the full timestamp displayed on mouseover, but I personally would prefer to have the information visible at the top-level.\r\n  - We could also make the timestamp format configurable if there are differing opinions on how it should be displayed.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the current format was chosen for a specific reason, feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\n---\r\nCurrent format:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40527812/136683557-72fa8585-c5db-43b0-b100-61348c1346e0.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40527812/136683563-45b661ea-6c51-445a-bc7d-4c8598ae24e3.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nNew format:\r\n  - The non-UTC format is perhaps a bit cluttered. I am fine with it, since I find both timezone name and UTC offset useful.

PR attempts to decrease the likelihood of memory issues for\r\nCI for non-committers. The MSSQL and MYSQL Provider and Integration\r\ntests when run together with other tests in parallel (for MSSQL even\r\nstandalone) might cause memory problems (143 or 137 exit code).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the approach slightly for low-memory conditions:\r\n\r\n1) MSSQL - both Integration and Providers tests are skipped\r\n   entirely (they will be run in High-Mem case so we will see if\r\n   there are any problems anyway)\r\n\r\n2) MySQL - both Integration and Providers tests are run separately\r\n   which will lead to slightly longer test runs but likely this\r\n   will save us from the occasional memory issues.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

users often ask for an easy way to monitor the success or failure of tasks and/or DAGs.  The use of callbacks, such as on_success_callback, helps users monitor DAG runs in an easily configurable way.\r\n\r\nThis document provides an overview of available callbacks, linked to the relevant section in the Tasks document.  It also provides a simple example of calling a function on any task failure in the DAG, as well as a separate function that is called upon the success of the last task in the

PR adds the possibility to specify a `wait_for_completion` flag in an `AwsGlueJobOperator` to indicate whether or not to wait for job run completion.\r\n\r\nThis is really useful because you can use the `run_id` available via `xcom` and put an `AwsGlueJobSensor` in the downstream to wait for completion.  \r\nWith this pattern (fire & forget + sensor) we avoid re-launching a Glue job if the task fails while waiting for completion.\r\n\r\nE.g: We create the `run_job` task and put a `sensor_job` in the downstream.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# ...\r\nfrom airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.glue import AwsGlueJobSensor\r\nfrom airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.glue import AwsGlueJobOperator\r\n# ...\r\nscript_args = {\r\n    \"--timestamp\": \"{{ ts }}\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nrun_job = AwsGlueJobOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"run_glue_job\",\r\n    job_name=\"exmaple-glue-job\",\r\n    script_args=script_args,\r\n    wait_for_completion=False,\r\n)\r\n\r\nsensor_job = AwsGlueJobSensor(\r\n    task_id=\"sensor_glue_job\",\r\n    job_name=\"exmaple-glue-job\",\r\n    run_id=\"{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='run_glue_job') }}\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nrun_job >> sensor_job\r\n#

Support prefix as a str or list. Haven't changed the name to avoid changes to existing consumers.\r\n2. Removed `self.full_url` since we can't build one for multiple prefixes . Not sure if this needs to be mentioned in [UPDATING.md]\r\n3. Updated existing test to pytest\r\n4. Added tests for multiple prefixes\r\n5. Added context type as Dict[str, Any]. There are other variations across the codebase. \r\n\r\nOther candidates (haven't picked yet, can do in same PR):\r\n1. Use `@cached_property` for the hook \r\n2. Support a callable parameter which lets the user get finer control on whether all prefixes or a subset of them should be considered as required.\r\n\r\ncloses:

\"backported\" the change in Python 3.7 to make Logger\r\nobjects be pickled \"by name\".

is not shown as a Connection type in the Connection view. That is because of two reasons:\r\n1. The PagerdutyHook class is not added in the provider.yaml, nor in the field `connection-types`, nor in the soon to be deprecated field `hook-class-names`. This PR fixes this.\r\n2. Even after fixing 1, the hooks could not be added as some required fields were missing: `conn_name_attr`, `default_conn_name`, `conn_type`, `hook_name`.

AIRFLOW_GID parameter was in the images for historical reasons,\r\nhowever for a long time we recommend everyone to use GID=0 in order\r\nto make it possible to run the image with Arbitrary UID. Setting\r\ndifferent group than 0 has NO VALUE actually. You can still\r\noverride the group of user when starting the container, so the only\r\nreal difference is that the \"airflow\" unmodifiable files such as\r\npython code belong to different group, which has no real value.\r\nYou can still use whatever group you want for mounted files and\r\nmodifiable resources. Airflow Docker image will work perfectly fine\r\nwhen the main group of the user is 0 (and we also have to remember\r\nthat if the user belongs to other groups in the host, it will also\r\nbelong to those group inside the container, AIRFLOW_GID has only\r\ninfluence on primary group of that user IN-CONTAINER (not outside\r\nof it).\r\n\r\nRemoving AIRFLOW_GID seems like best choice for Airflow 2.2.\r\n\r\nFixes: #18709\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

even if legacy `concurrency` dag parameter is specified, it is always ignored because `max_active_tasks` is always initialized from `core.max_active_tasks_per_dag`.\r\nIn our case this caused unexpected throttling of the task concurrency on production and performance issues.\r\n\r\n`concurrency` parameter should always be used, if provided, as this preserves backward compatibility for users performing the migration.\r\n\r\nTested locally:\r\n```\r\nDAG(\r\n    dag_id='xxx',\r\n...\r\n    concurrency=1,\r\n)\r\n```\r\nBefore fix:\r\n```\r\n{scheduler_job.py:413} INFO - DAG xxx has 1/16 running and queued tasks\r\n```\r\nAfter fix:\r\n```\r\n{scheduler_job.py:413} INFO - DAG xxx has 1/1 running and queued tasks\r\n```\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

an incorrectly implemented timetable may crash the scheduler process entirely due to uncaught exceptions. This PR adds exception handlers around those calls. A failed `infer_manual_data_interval()` will cause the manual DAG run being skipped, and a failed `next_dagrun_info()` will cause the DAG run to not happen, and the DAG not being scheduled anymore (because `None` is set on `DagModel.next_dagrun`) until the DAG file is modified.\r\n\r\nFor now, the exception is simply logged. In the future we'll add a new db model similar to `ImportError` and hold these errors and display them on the web UI. This new model class will also be designed to incorporate `ImportError` eventually.","created_at":"2021-10-05T07:12:19Z","updated_at":"2021-10-05T12:47:35Z","closed_at":"2021-10-05T11:10:39Z","merged_at":"2021-10-05T11:10:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0442f30e296eae5e1f38fb74d0fbb6b1c5cef54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full
