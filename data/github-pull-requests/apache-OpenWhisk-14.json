PR provides a MongoDBArtifactStore implementation to enable using MongoDB for storing subjects, whisks and activation in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nSome users may want to use other database backends instead of CouchDB to store entities, this PR provides MongoDB as an alternative choice for these users\r\n\r\n\r\n## MongoDB driver\r\nMongoDB provides [official drivers](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/) for many languages, in this case, we pick the [mongo-scala-driver](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-scala-driver/2.2/), this driver provides an idiomatic Scala API that is built on top of the MongoDB Async Java driver.\r\n\r\n## Design Considerations\r\n### Data Model\r\nThe data scheme in MongoDB is just like CouchDB except that MongoDB doesn't have a `_rev` field, below is the data of `whisk.system/invokerHealthTestAction0` in CouchDB and MongoDB:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>CouchDB</td>\r\n<td>MongoDB</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n  \"_id\": \"whisk.system/invokerHealthTestAction0\",\r\n  \"_rev\": \"68-e72440f911c64ab11441c09e730e5ab8\",\r\n  \"name\": \"invokerHealthTestAction0\",\r\n  \"publish\": false,\r\n  \"annotations\": [],\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"updated\": 1524476933182,\r\n  \"entityType\": \"action\",\r\n  \"exec\": {\r\n    \"kind\": \"nodejs:6\",\r\n    \"code\": \"function main(params) { return params; }\",\r\n    \"binary\": false\r\n  },\r\n  \"parameters\": [],\r\n  \"limits\": {\r\n    \"timeout\": 60000,\r\n    \"memory\": 256,\r\n    \"logs\": 10\r\n  },\r\n  \"namespace\": \"whisk.system\"\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n  \"_id\" : \"whisk.system/invokerHealthTestAction0\",\r\n  \"name\" : \"invokerHealthTestAction0\",\r\n  \"publish\" : false,\r\n  \"annotations\" : [ ],\r\n  \"version\" : \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"updated\" : NumberLong(\"1524473794826\"),\r\n  \"entityType\" : \"action\",\r\n  \"exec\" : {\r\n    \"kind\" : \"nodejs:6\",\r\n    \"code\" : \"function main(params) { return params; }\",\r\n    \"binary\" : false\r\n  },\r\n  \"parameters\" : [ ],\r\n  \"limits\" : {\r\n    \"timeout\" : 60000,\r\n    \"memory\" : 256,\r\n    \"logs\" : 10\r\n  },\r\n  \"namespace\" : \"whisk.system\"\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n*The MongoDB use BSON to store data,  `MongoDbStrore` will convert bson to json, this is transparent to users*\r\n\r\nRegarding the `_rev` field, there is no alternative way in MongoDB to do the same thing, so the `MongoDbStore` calculate a value according to the document's content manually, and make it as the `_rev` field.\r\n\r\n### Attachment\r\nMongoDB use [GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/index.html) to store and retrieve files that exceed the BSON-document size limit of 16 MB.\r\n\r\nAttachment in MongoDB is stored in a separate collection with a independent `_id`, this PR use the `doc._id + doc.file_name` as the attachment's `_id` field, then we can find the relative attachment easily.\r\n\r\n### Query\r\nCouchDB use `designDoc` to do the query operation, ~~MongoDB can use `view` feature to achieve the same effect, there are some examples below~~:\r\n\r\n#### whisks-filters.v2.1.0/activations\r\n```\r\ndb.createView(\r\n    \"whisk_local_whisks.whisks-filters.v2.1.0/activations\",\r\n    \"whisk_local_whisks\",\r\n    [\r\n        { \"$match\": { \"activationId\": { \"$exists\": true } } },\r\n        {\r\n            \"$addFields\": {\r\n                \"flag\": {\r\n                    \"$arrayElemAt\": [{ \"$filter\": { \"input\": \"$annotations\", \"cond\": { \"$eq\": [\"$$this.key\", \"path\"] } } }, 0]\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        { \"$lookup\": { \"from\": \"whisk_local_whisks\", \"localField\": \"_id\", \"foreignField\": \"_id\", \"as\": \"doc\" } },\r\n        {\r\n            \"$project\": {\r\n                \"key\": [{ \"$ifNull\": [\"$flag.value\", { \"$concat\": [\"$namespace\", \"/\", \"$name\"] }] }, \"$start\"],\r\n                \"value\": {\r\n                    \"namespace\": \"$namespace\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"$name\",\r\n                    \"version\": \"$version\",\r\n                    \"publish\": \"$publish\",\r\n                    \"annotations\": \"$annotations\",\r\n                    \"activationId\": \"$activationId\",\r\n                    \"start\": \"$start\",\r\n                    \"end\": \"$end\",\r\n                    \"duration\": \"$duration\",\r\n                    \"cause\": \"$cause\",\r\n                    \"statusCode\": \"$response.statusCode\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"_id\": 0,\r\n                \"id\": \"$_id\",\r\n                \"doc\": { \"$arrayElemAt\": [\"$doc\", 0] }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs @chetanmeh suggest and I test again with 300,000 activations, the performance of `view` in MongoDB is not good as native query while call `wsk activation list`, so I change strategies and follow the [openwhisk-mongo](https://github.com/chetanmeh/openwhisk-mongo)\r\n\r\n### Reduce Design Doc\r\n~~Unfortunately, there is no easy way to do the same thing with the CouchDB style `reduce` in MongoDB, because of `reduce` in CouchDB can use `start_key` 、`end_key` as filters to produce a different result while `reduce` in MongoDB can not, so I do a trade-off to simulate some simple CouchDB style `reduce`~~, currently, this pr doesn't support the `Reduce` feature, need investigate it later\r\n\r\n\r\n## MongoDB Deployment\r\nCurrently only support deploying MongoDB replica set.\r\n\r\n## Progress\r\n\r\n### Finished Work\r\n- [x] Basic Usage(create、update、query、delete)\r\n- [x]

For our usage we have two options\r\n\r\n1. [REST API][2]\r\n2. [Async Java SDK][3]\r\n3. [Sync Java SDK][6]\r\n\r\nCompared to CouchDB performing queries against CosmosDB requires client side computation which involves sending queries to each partition and then collect and merge the result set. The Async Java SDK takes care of all these interactions and provides a simplified reactive api based on [RxJava][5]\r\n\r\nGiven the complexity involved in performing various operations against CosmosDB this PR uses the Java SDK to simplify and speed up the implementation\r\n\r\n### Design Considerations\r\n\r\n#### Data Model\r\n\r\nBelow is the json representation of `whisk.system/utils/echo` action saved in CouchDB and CosmosDB\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>CouchDB</th>\r\n        <th>CosmosDB</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n    <pre lang=\"json\">{\r\n  \"_id\": \"whisk.system/utils/echo\",\r\n  \"_rev\": \"1-975e42c7be63291bf0ff2500e24caaae\",\r\n  \"name\": \"echo\",\r\n  \"publish\": false,\r\n  \"annotations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"exec\",\r\n      \"value\": \"nodejs:6\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"parameters\",\r\n      \"value\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"description\": \"Any JSON entity\",\r\n          \"name\": \"payload\",\r\n          \"required\": false\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"updated\": 1524472866521,\r\n  \"entityType\": \"action\",\r\n  \"exec\": {\r\n    \"kind\": \"nodejs:6\",\r\n    \"code\": \"code\",\r\n    \"binary\": false\r\n  },\r\n  \"parameters\": [],\r\n  \"limits\": {\r\n    \"timeout\": 60000,\r\n    \"memory\": 256,\r\n    \"logs\": 10\r\n  },\r\n  \"namespace\": \"whisk.system/utils\"\r\n}\r\n    </pre>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n    <pre lang=\"json\">{\r\n  \"id\": \"whisk.system|utils|echo\",\r\n  \"name\": \"echo\",\r\n  \"publish\": false,\r\n  \"annotations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": \"nodejs:6\",\r\n      \"key\": \"exec\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"payload\",\r\n          \"description\": \"Any JSON entity\",\r\n          \"required\": false\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"key\": \"parameters\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"updated\": 1524397327877,\r\n  \"entityType\": \"action\",\r\n  \"exec\": {\r\n    \"code\": \"code\",\r\n    \"kind\": \"nodejs:6\",\r\n    \"binary\": false\r\n  },\r\n  \"parameters\": [],\r\n  \"limits\": {\r\n    \"memory\": 256,\r\n    \"logs\": 10,\r\n    \"timeout\": 60000\r\n  },\r\n  \"namespace\": \"whisk.system/utils\",\r\n  \"_c\": {\r\n    \"rootns\": \"whisk.system\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"_self\": \"dbs/MZFtAA==/colls/MZFtAO2-Ig4=/docs/MZFtAO2-Ig4cAAAAAAAAAA==/\",\r\n  \"_rid\": \"MZFtAO2-Ig4cAAAAAAAAAA==\",\r\n  \"_etag\": \"\\\"09004181-0000-0000-0000-5adc75090000\\\"\",\r\n  \"_attachments\": \"attachments/\",\r\n  \"_ts\": 1524397321\r\n}\r\n    </pre>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nBelow are some keys aspects on how data is stored in CosmosDB\r\n\r\n##### id\r\n\r\nThe id field in CosmosDB is referred as `id` (in CouchDB its `_id`). Per [Resource Id docs][9] \r\n\r\n> The following characters are restricted and cannot be used in the Id property: '/', '\\', '?', '#'\r\n\r\nAs `/` cannot be used `CosmosDBArtifactStore` would replace `/` with `|`. So `whisk.system/utils/echo` is stored as `whisk.system|utils|echo`\r\n\r\nPer [OpenWhisk Naming Restrictions][10]\r\n\r\n> The subsequent characters can be alphanumeric, spaces, or any of the following: `_, @, ., -`\r\n\r\nSo no other char needs this treatment\r\n\r\n##### Revision Handling\r\n\r\nCosmosDB [supports optimistic concurrency control][11] (OCC) through HTTP entity tags, or ETags. So for all practical purpose `_rev` is mapped to `_etag` field of CosmosDB and all semantics around concurrent updates are supported via that. \r\n\r\n##### Computed Fields\r\n\r\n`CosmosDBArtifactStore` uses a subdocument under `_c` to store some computed fields which are referred in queries. Such fields are computed by CouchDB view logic and here these are set at time of inserting/updating the docs via `ArtifactStore` API. \r\n\r\nSo any logic which directly manipulates the objects need to also support these fields\r\n\r\n### Limits\r\n\r\nFollowing are some of the limits enforced by CosmosDB. Currently OpenWhisk does not enforce any restriction on some of these so there is a change in behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Max document size is [2 MB][16] \r\n2. The id must not exceed [255 characters][17]\r\n\r\n### Partitioning Strategy\r\n\r\nOne of the key aspect of using CosmosDB is to determine the [partitioning key][22]. This can be decided on per collection basis\r\n\r\nFor now this PR uses `/id` itself also as the partitioning key. This has following pros and cons\r\n\r\n#### Cons\r\n\r\n* All the queries would need to be sent to all partitions. This would lead to higher RU consumption and possibly higher latency in query responses\r\n\r\nNote that currently query in CouchDB also [hits all partitions][23] and thus performance decreases when number of partitions are large. There are some discussions to support [querying for specific partitions][24]. That would make it similar to CosmosDB. \r\n\r\n#### Pros\r\n\r\nFrom production usage perspective OpenWhisk does not perform any query in critical path of activation. There are calls to DB are based on specific id lookups. This enables that read load would be distributed across actual partitions and thus would lead to fair utilization of resource units.\r\n\r\nIf we use `namespace` as partition key then it can lead to situation where if number of activity related to that namespace increase considerably then it may become hot and thus exhause the resource quota. Requests to the same partition key can't exceed the provisioned throughput allocated to a partition and will be rate-limited.\r\n\r\nGiven that queries are mostly performed during authoring workflow and increase in latency in query responses may be ok \r\n\r\n### Attachment Storage\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR the attachments are being stored in CosmosDB itself using its [attachment support][21]. This is similar to how attachments are supported in CouchDB. This enables storing upto 10GB of attachments. \r\n\r\nGoing forward once [AttachmentStore SPI](apache/incubator-openwhisk#3453) PR gets merged this would be change to use the SPI with default implementation using CosmosDB attachment support with an option to use say S3/Azure BlobStore based SPI implementation\r\n\r\n### Query Execution\r\n\r\n`CosmosDBArtifactStore` maps the CouchDB views to [CosmosDB Queries][12]. Following are details around how the views are mapped\r\n\r\n#### Generic Whisks View\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>CosmosDB</th>\r\n        <th>CouchDB</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n         <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"sql\">SELECT \r\n    {\r\n      \"name\":r['name'],\r\n      \"publish\": r['publish'],\r\n      \"annotations\": r['annotations'],\r\n      \"version\": r['version'],\r\n      \"id\": r['id'],\r\n      \"updated\": r['updated'],\r\n      \"exec\": {\r\n        \"binary\": r['exec']['binary']\r\n      },\r\n      \"limits\": r['limits'],\r\n      \"namespace\": r['namespace']\r\n    }\r\nFROM   root r \r\nWHERE  r.entitytype = @entityType \r\n       AND ( r.namespace = @namespace \r\n              OR r._c.rootns = @namespace ) \r\nORDER  BY r.updated DESC \r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"javascript\">function view(doc) {\r\n    var PATHSEP = \"/\";\r\n    var isAction = function (doc) { return (doc.exec !== undefined) };\r\n    if (isAction(doc)) try {\r\n        var ns = doc.namespace.split(PATHSEP);\r\n        var root = ns[0];\r\n        var value = {\r\n            namespace: doc.namespace,\r\n            name: doc.name,\r\n            version: doc.version,\r\n            publish: doc.publish,\r\n            annotations: doc.annotations,\r\n            limits: doc.limits,\r\n            exec: { binary: doc.exec.binary || false},\r\n            updated: doc.updated\r\n        };\r\n        emit([doc.namespace, doc.updated], value);\r\n        if (root !== doc.namespace) {\r\n            emit([root, doc.updated], value);\r\n        }\r\n    } catch (e) {}\r\n}\r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nAbove example shows how a `whisks.v2.1.0/actions` view is mapped to query. Few things to note here\r\n\r\n1. Property names in select clause use [Quoted Property Accessor][13] as some of the property names like `end` is a reserved word. \r\n   So `CosmosDBUtil` would use the mode by default for all fields selected\r\n2. Projecting JSON - Select clause attempts to return a minimum superset of field names as specified in view javascript. \r\n   This enables computing some  fields like `exec` on server side via `DocumentHandler.transformViewResult`\r\n\r\nSimilar sql is generated for following views\r\n\r\n* whisks.v2.1.0-actions\r\n* whisks.v2.1.0-packages  \r\n* whisks.v2.1.0-rules\r\n* whisks.v2.1.0-triggers\r\n\r\nFor above view the query is performed by matching namespace in full `r.namespace` or on root namespace `r._c.rootns` and `r.entityType` set to required type\r\n\r\n#### Public Packages Query\r\n\r\nFor public package there is a check for `binding`\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>CosmosDB</th>\r\n        <th>CouchDB</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"sql\">SELECT\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": r['name'],\r\n      \"publish\": r['publish'],\r\n      \"annotations\": r['annotations'],\r\n      \"version\": r['version'],\r\n      \"id\": r['id'],\r\n      \"updated\": r['updated'],\r\n      \"namespace\": r['namespace']\r\n    } AS view\r\nFROM     root r \r\nWHERE    r.publish = true \r\nAND      ( \r\n                  NOT IS_OBJECT(r.binding) \r\n         OR       r.binding = {}) \r\nAND      r.entitytype = @entityType \r\nAND      ( \r\n                  r.namespace = @namespace \r\n         OR       r._c.rootns = @namespace) \r\nAND      r.updated >= @since \r\nORDER BY r.updated DESC  \r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"javascript\">function view(doc) {\r\n  var isPublicPackage = function(doc) { \r\n    return Object.keys(doc.binding).length == 0 and doc.publish;\r\n  }\r\n  if (isPublicPackage(doc)) try {\r\n    var value = {\r\n      namespace: doc.namespace,\r\n      name: doc.name,\r\n      version: doc.version,\r\n      publish: doc.publish,\r\n      annotations: doc.annotations,\r\n      updated: doc.updated,\r\n      binding: false\r\n    };\r\n    emit([doc.namespace, doc.updated], value);\r\n  } catch (e) {}\r\n}\r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n#### Activations Query\r\n\r\nFor `whisks-filters.v2.1.0/activations` view the query is made on `r._c.nspath` which is a computed field based view logic\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>CosmosDB</th>\r\n        <th>CouchDB</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"sql\">SELECT \r\n{\r\n  \"name\": r['name'],\r\n  \"activationId\": r['activationId'],\r\n  \"publish\": r['publish'],\r\n  \"annotations\": r['annotations'],\r\n  \"version\": r['version'],\r\n  response: {\r\n    \"statusCode\": r['response']['statusCode']\r\n  },\r\n  \"id\": r['id'],\r\n  \"cause\": r['cause'],\r\n  \"end\": r['end'],\r\n  \"start\": r['start'],\r\n  \"namespace\": r['namespace']\r\n} AS VIEW \r\nFROM   root r \r\nWHERE  r._c.nspath = @nsvalue \r\nORDER  BY r.start DESC \r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"javascript\">function (doc) {\r\n  var PATHSEP = \"/\";\r\n  var isActivation = function (doc) { return (doc.activationId !== undefined) };\r\n  var summarize = function (doc) {\r\n    var endtime = doc.end !== 0 ? doc.end : undefined;\r\n    return {\r\n        namespace: doc.namespace,\r\n        name: doc.name,\r\n        version: doc.version,\r\n        publish: doc.publish,\r\n        annotations: doc.annotations,\r\n        activationId: doc.activationId,\r\n        start: doc.start,\r\n        end: endtime,\r\n        duration: endtime !== undefined ? endtime - doc.start : undefined,\r\n        cause: doc.cause,\r\n        statusCode: (endtime !== undefined AND doc.response !== undefined AND doc.response.statusCode !== undefined) ? doc.response.statusCode : undefined\r\n      }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  var pathFilter = function(doc) {\r\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; doc.annotations.length; i++) {\r\n      var a = doc.annotations[i];\r\n      if (a.key == \"path\") try {\r\n          var p = a.value.split(PATHSEP);\r\n          if (p.length == 3) {\r\n            return p[1] + PATHSEP + doc.name;\r\n          } else return doc.name;\r\n      } catch (e) {\r\n        return doc.name;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    return doc.name;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (isActivation(doc)) try {\r\n    var value = summarize(doc)\r\n    emit([doc.namespace+PATHSEP+pathFilter(doc), doc.start], value);\r\n  } catch (e) {}\r\n}\r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n#### Subject Query\r\n\r\n**`subjects/identities`**\r\n\r\nAt time of authentication `subjects/identities` view is used. For that below query is invoked which makes use of INNER JOIN to query on `namespaces` sub document \r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>CosmosDB</th>\r\n        <th>CouchDB</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"sql\">SELECT r AS VIEW \r\nFROM   root r \r\nJOIN   n IN r.namespaces \r\nWHERE  \r\n    (NOT(is_defined(r.blocked))  OR r.blocked = falses)\r\nAND (\r\n     (r.uuid = @uuid AND r.KEY = @key) \r\n       OR (n.uuid = @uuid AND n.KEY = @key)\r\n    )\r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"javascript\">function (doc) {\r\n  if(doc.uuid AND doc.key AND!doc.blocked) {\r\n    var v = {namespace: doc.subject, uuid: doc.uuid, key: doc.key};\r\n    emit([doc.subject], v);\r\n    emit([doc.uuid, doc.key], v);\r\n  }\r\n  if(doc.namespaces AND !doc.blocked) {\r\n    doc.namespaces.forEach(function(namespace) {\r\n      var v = {_id: namespace.name + '/limits', namespace: namespace.name, uuid: namespace.uuid, key: namespace.key};\r\n      emit([namespace.name], v);\r\n      emit([namespace.uuid, namespace.key], v);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n**`namespaceThrottlings/blockedNamespaces`**\r\n\r\nThis view is used by `NamespaceBlacklist` logic to peridically query for blacklisted namespace\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>CosmosDB</th>\r\n        <th>CouchDB</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"sql\">SELECT r AS VIEW \r\nFROM   root r \r\nWHERE  r.blocked = true \r\n        OR r.concurrentinvocations = 0 \r\n        OR r.invocationsperminute = 0 \r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <pre lang=\"javascript\">function (doc) {\r\n  if (doc._id.indexOf(\"/limits\") >= 0) {\r\n    if (doc.concurrentInvocations === 0 || doc.invocationsPerMinute === 0) {\r\n      var namespace = doc._id.replace(\"/limits\", \"\");\r\n      emit(namespace, 1);\r\n    }\r\n  } else if (doc.subject && doc.namespaces && doc.blocked) {\r\n    doc.namespaces.forEach(function(namespace) {\r\n      emit(namespace.name, 1);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n            </pre>\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### Shutdown Handling\r\n\r\nAll `CosmosDBArtifactStore` instances (3 in total for whisks, activations and subjects) share the same `AsyncDocumentClient` instance. So to handle the `shutdown` call properly this PR uses a `ReferenceCounted` approach where all instance share same reference and once the reference count reaches zero the client instance is closed\r\n\r\n### Client side skipping\r\n\r\n`ArtifactStore.query` API supports `skip` to support paginated query over large dataset. For CouchDB the query is handled by one of the shards which in turn [queries all the other shards and then merges the result on server side][23] (i.e. scatter and gather)\r\n\r\nFor CosmosDB the query results are collected from various partitions and merged by the sdk. Thus  `skip` is implemented by dropping the query results. Due to this going to later pages in a query result would be slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Batching not supported\r\n\r\n`ArtifactStoreProvider.makeStore` exposes a `batching` flag to enable batch insert mode for activations. CosmosDB does not have a bulk insert api so this flag is currently ignored.\r\n\r\nAzure docs [suggest][20] using stored procedures to achive bulk insert support. However that requires all document meant to be inserted to be part of same partition. With our usage of `id` field as partition key this would not help much\r\n\r\n### Testing Approach\r\n\r\nSome of the tests from this PR need to access the CosmosDB service and thus require the account credentials. These credentials would be provided by environment variables. Based on [discussion][7] on dev following appraoch is taken. \r\n\r\n1. Tests would always run on travis runs for apache/incubator-openwhisk master\r\n2. For other runs\r\n    1. If the travis has required env variables configured tests would run\r\n    2. If required environment variables are not found then they would be skipped\r\n    3. On my [fork][8] the credentials are configured and thus tests would be executed\r\n\r\n### Pending Work\r\n\r\n- [x] Attachment Support\r\n- [x] Query around subject and namespaces\r\n- [x] Indexes for various collections\r\n- [x] CI Integration\r\n\r\n## Third Party Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis PR pulls in following major dependencies\r\n\r\n* com.microsoft.azure:azure-cosmosdb:1.0.0\r\n    * io.reactivex:rxnetty:0.4.20\r\n    * org.json:json:20140107\r\n* io.reactivex:rxjava-reactive-streams:1.2.1\r\n* io.reactivex:rxscala_2.11:0.26.5\r\n\r\n### Dependency on org.json\r\n\r\n`org.json` dependency library license is marked as [Category-X][18] and hence such a library [cannot be used as a dependency in Apache Project][19]. For this Azure/azure-cosmosdb-java#29 has been opened and is being addressed\r\n\r\n<a name=\"cosmos-try-out\"></a>\r\n## Trying out\r\n\r\nTo try out the CosmosDB integration locally (for now only tests) follow steps below\r\n\r\n1. Create a free server from [Try CosmosDB][25] and select SQL API\r\n2. From within portal look for _Azure Cosmos DB account_ and go to _Keys_ section\r\n3. Copy the `URI` and `PRIMARY KEY`\r\n4. Specify following environment variables\r\n    - `COSMOSDB_KEY` - Use the `PRIMARY KEY` value here\r\n    - `COSMOSDB_ENDPOINT` - Use the `URI` value here\r\n    - `COSMOSDB_NAME` - Set it to `openwhisk`\r\n\r\nWith this it would be possible to run `CosmosDBArtifactStoreTests` locally.\r\n\r\n_Once #3689 is done it would be possible to run complete OpenWhisk setup using CosmosDB via ansible setup scripts_\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [X] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [X]

PR adds a performance test, which measures the latency of warm actions.\r\n\r\nThe test can be executed for NodeJs, Python, swift and Java actions.\r\n\r\nTo test the warm latency the test creates an action, invokes it ones warm and invokes it 100 times warm afterwards. In the end of the test the action is deleted again.\r\nOnly one action after each other is activated. There are never two actions at the same time in the system.\r\n\r\nIn addition this PR adds the abilitly to create and invoke actions with the gatling extension for OpenWhisk.\r\n\r\n## Related issue

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThis PR enables sending activation metadata to Kafka, which might be helpful to alleviate the exertion of CouchDB we observe today as well as to preserve user activations metadata for real time processing. \r\n\r\nAt the moment I introduce a new kafka topic called `events` which will accept events of 2 types: Activations and Metrics. First corresponds to the metadata which is collected after an activation is finished (initTime, waitTime, responseCode, kind, etc), second stands for User related metrics of any kind (throttledActivations, concurrentActivations). The data is not aggregated, it is sent to Kafka instantly. \r\n\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [x] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nAdd a level of abstraction the controller role in ansible.  It will now accept a set of parameters to configure:\r\n\r\n1.  `host_group` - the group from the hosts file used to determine indexing during deployment\r\n2.  `name_prefix` - the prefix (i.e. 'controller', 'crudController') used to name docker instances\r\n3.  `controller_index_base` - the base starting point for indexing in the total controller arrays\r\n4.  `join_akka_cluster` - (book) true=join the cluster; false=keep akka local\r\n\r\nWhile working on #3412, it was uncovered that some (or at least one major) implementers of OpenWhisk segregate their controllers and use a copy of the rolefile to deploy it.  That creates maintenance overhead and deployment complexity in keeping ansible playbooks in sync.  This change abstracts the necessary parameters to allow the OpenWhisk playbook to be used to deploy multiple 'collections' of controllers into an environment. \r\n\r\nThe change also includes significant linting of 'roles/controller/tasks/deploy.yml' and '.../clean.yml' to support maintainability and readability.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [X] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [X] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a gatling test suite with a wrapper to easily create new gatling tests.\r\n\r\nIn addition I added a first test, which tests the throughput of the endpoint `api/v1`. With this test it would be possible to catch regressions that are caused by some wrong configuration in nginx, like we had in the past.\r\n\r\nThis PR will replace #3427.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (generally a non-breaking change which closes an issue).\r\n- [ ] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Please review the points below which help you make sure you've covered all aspects of the change you're making. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I signed an [Apache

guides](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/wiki/Contributing:-Git-guidelines#code-readiness) and followed the recommendations (Travis CI will check :).\r\n- [ ] I added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [ ] My changes require further changes to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I updated the documentation where necessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-05T07:59:46Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T08:31:27Z","closed_at":"2018-04-13T08:16:39Z","merged_at":"2018-04-13T08:16:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"56891fbeb1ca306b4685396f13f07cb4b60a3022","assignee":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":401833916,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDE4MzM5MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/labels/review","name":"review","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Review

an in-memory `ArtifactStore` implementation which can be used for unit testing and `ArtifactStore` SPI contract validation as proposed in #3387\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a `MemoryArtifactStore` which stores the artifacts in an in-memory map and supports all operations as expected from an `ArtifactStore`. \r\n\r\n### Test Suite\r\n\r\nThe PR also includes a test suite `ArtifactStoreBehavior` to validate the `ArtifactStore` SPI contract. This is broken down in following parts\r\n\r\n* `ArtifactStoreCRUDBehaviors` - Checks normal CRUD operations\r\n* `ArtifactStoreQueryBehaviors` - Check the query contract around skipping, limiting, sorting etc\r\n* `ArtifactStoreSubjectQueryBehaviors` - Check views specific to `WhiskAuth` specially around the join support for limits\r\n    * subjects/identities\r\n    * namespaceThrottlings/blockedNamespaces\r\n\r\nFor now these tests are run for 2 stores and passes for them\r\n\r\n* MemoryArtifactStoreTests\r\n* CouchDBArtifactStoreTests\r\n\r\n### Design for Non CouchDB Stores\r\n\r\nCouchDB performs queries based on computed views. Most other databases provide a query interface with backing indexes. Currently OpenWhisk logic provides the view name as part of `query` invocation and thus has an implicit dependency on CouchDB view support. This has following impact on any non CouchDB store implementation\r\n\r\n#### Mapping views to queries\r\n\r\nFor database which support SQL like constructs we need to map the query as expressed in CouchDB view to SQL. For e.g. if we need to map `whisks.v2.1.0/actions` view to some query\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction (doc) {\r\n  var PATHSEP = \"/\";\r\n  var isAction = function (doc) { return (doc.exec !== undefined) };\r\n  if (isAction(doc)) try {\r\n    var ns = doc.namespace.split(PATHSEP);\r\n    var root = ns[0];\r\n    var value = {\r\n      namespace: doc.namespace,\r\n      name: doc.name,\r\n      version: doc.version,\r\n      publish: doc.publish,\r\n      annotations: doc.annotations,\r\n      limits: doc.limits,\r\n      exec: { binary: doc.exec.binary || false},\r\n      updated: doc.updated\r\n    };\r\n    emit([doc.namespace, doc.updated], value);\r\n    if (root !== doc.namespace) {\r\n      emit([root, doc.updated], value);\r\n    }\r\n  } catch (e) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it would be expressed as following pseudo query\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT namespace, \r\n       name, \r\n       version, \r\n       publish, \r\n       annotations, \r\n       limits, \r\n       updated, \r\n       EXEC \r\nFROM   whisks \r\nWHERE  entitytype = 'action' \r\n       AND ( namespace = $namespace \r\n              OR rootns = $namespace ) \r\n       AND ( updated >= since \r\n             AND updated <= $upto ) \r\nORDER  BY updated \r\n```\r\n\r\nHere\r\n* `rootns` - Is a computed field created at time of creation (see below)\r\n*  `exec` - Would be a computed field created at runtime during query result post processing\r\n* select criteria - Fields specified in select part are function of view used (see projected fields below)\r\n\r\nSometimes its not possible to completely map the view condition to query. For e.g. in subject queries. In such cases query partially applies the condition and then in `DocumentHandler` full conditions are applied thus result returned from query may be a super set of actual result set and actual result is thus obtained via \"filtering\"\r\n\r\n#### Interpreting the keys\r\n\r\nQuery parameters `startKey` and `endKey` are closely tied to view implementation. Thus any other store would need to interpret the values in keys as per the view name. To support that this PR introduces a `DocumentHandler` trait which defines the db neutral operations\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntrait DocumentHandler {\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Returns a JsObject having computed fields. This is a substitution for fields\r\n   * computed in CouchDB views\r\n   */\r\n  def computedFields(js: JsObject): JsObject = JsObject.empty\r\n\r\n  def fieldsRequiredForView(ddoc: String, view: String): Set[String] = Set()\r\n\r\n  def transformViewResult(\r\n    ddoc: String,\r\n    view: String,\r\n    startKey: List[Any],\r\n    endKey: List[Any],\r\n    includeDocs: Boolean,\r\n    js: JsObject,\r\n    provider: DocumentProvider)(implicit transid: TransactionId, ec: ExecutionContext): Future[JsObject]\r\n\r\n  def shouldAlwaysIncludeDocs(ddoc: String, view: String): Boolean = false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a separate handle implementation provided for each entity i.e. `ActivationHandler`, `WhisksHandler` and `SubjectHandler`\r\n\r\nSections below would provide more details on the various methods\r\n\r\n#### Computed Keys - `computedFields`\r\n\r\nSome of the views in use make use of computed fields in the view logic. For e.g. view for rules computes a `root` namespace when namespace is a multi segment path\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction (doc) {\r\n  var PATHSEP = \"/\";\r\n  var isRule = function (doc) {  return (doc.trigger !== undefined) };\r\n  if (isRule(doc)) try {\r\n    var ns = doc.namespace.split(PATHSEP);\r\n    var root = ns[0];\r\n    emit([doc.namespace, doc.updated], 1);\r\n    if (root !== doc.namespace) {\r\n      emit([root, doc.updated], 1);\r\n    }\r\n  } catch (e) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor supporting such cases in non CouchDB store `DocumentHandler#computedFields` can be used. This would compute the required field at time of `put` which the `ArtifactStore` implementation can then persist along with the main document. For e.g. for Mongo case such a computed json object can be stored under a separate `_computed` field internally.\r\n\r\nThese computed fields can then be used for defining declarative indexes. For now following computed fields are generated\r\n\r\n* WhiskEntity\r\n    * `rootns` - Root name space.\r\n* Activations\r\n    * `nspath` - Namespace with Entity path. The nspath is computed based on logic in whisks-filters.v2.1.0/activations\r\n    * `deleteLogs` - This field is computed based on logic in `logCleanup/byDateWithLogs` i.e. flag would enabled for all such activations which are not sequence\r\n\r\nSee [Mongo ArtifactStore](chetanmeh/openwhisk-mongo#/8) for more details and examples\r\n\r\n#### Projected Fields - `fieldsRequiredForView`\r\n\r\nCouchDB views determine which all fields are included in returned document as part of query result. For non CouchDB cases this field list is defined by `fieldsRequiredForView`. ArtifactStore implementation can use it for projecting which all fields should be included\r\n\r\n#### Join Support - `transformViewResult`\r\n\r\nCouchDB supports [joins][1] which is used for subject queries to fetch the limits. Most other no sql db does not support such joins. So for such cases `transformViewResult` can be used which would be responsible for performing the join. For it to work the `ArtifactStore` need to provide an implementation of `DocumentProvider` which returns the raw json for provided id\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrait DocumentProvider {\r\n  protected[database] def get(id: DocId)(implicit transid: TransactionId): Future[Option[JsObject]]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### MemoryViewMapper\r\n\r\nThis is an `ArtifactStore` implementation specific abstraction which converts the query keys passed to `query` to underlying storage query syntax. Each store implementation needs to have similar logic implementated which cover all possible scenarios from all the active views\r\n\r\nHere the test suite plays an important role by validating that all query cases are covered. \r\n\r\n#### TestSuite and future view changes\r\n\r\nThis test suite would need to be kept in sync with any change in view logic or addition of new views. Then only it can be ensured that other `ArtifactStore` implementation cover all the usecases as supported by default CouchDB. So going forward `MemoryArtifactStore` would become a cononical implementation of `ArtifactStore` contract!\r\n\r\n## Pending Work\r\n\r\n- [x] Support for `namespaceThrottlings/blockedNamespaces` view\r\n- [x] More coverage of entity tests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3387)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

reopens the previous  #2956 PR; fork-join-executor wasn't the right choice previously and it is using Thread Pool dispatchers now, which are the correct way to handle this kind of IO separation with Akka. Defaults are set to what should be a reasonable starting point, especially given that couch and kafka now have their own separate execution pools from the \"Default\"/main system.\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n\r\n Kafka and CouchDB clients each get their own dispatchers\r\n  * This should prevent all of the akka based stuff from competing constantly for threads\r\n  * Kafka and Couch can be tuned now based on individual needs\r\n  * Using thread-pool dispatchers, which are best suited for these processes (default is fork-join)\r\n- Dispatchers are defined in common `reference.conf`, so config can be overridden by dependents\r\n\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, OpenWhisk is sharing a single fork-join-executor across the board for the entire `ActorSystem`, which is less than ideal especially when dealing with potentially blocking IO. \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#2954 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [x] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThis is useful when controller instances don't get unique configs to startup, such as in mesos/kube envs. \r\n\r\nDownstream impact is that transaction ids take on a slightly different form as:\r\n```transaction id that shows in logs = <instandid> + <transactionid>```\r\nInternally, transactionid is numberic, but when emitted it is prefixed with the instance id. \r\n\r\nWithout changing `ansible/controller/tasks/deploy.yml`, the output in logs will be: changed by having the numeric instance prefixed on the transaction number of the log message:\r\nif controller starts with `0`, then `[INFO] [#tid_3]` -> `[INFO] [#tid_03]`\r\n\r\nIt currently does NOT impact log messages with transaction ids that are _hard coded_ e.g. invokerHealth still shows in logs as `[INFO] [#sid_121]`\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please

not use a pre-baked image with the oracle java bits already setup, since the Dockerfile is somewhat complicated for alpine + oracle java.\r\n\r\nI currently chose the 8u162b12_server-jre variant, and not the 8u162b12_jdk variant - from what I've read most jdk runtime tools are there, but I don't have an exhaustive list of differences. Open to change to jdk if needed, but if not, would rather avoid the extra space and use the smallest possible base image.\r\n\r\nsed + curl are installed, since they are required for init scripts in use already. curl is used by alpine-java, but removed after use; sed is available without update, but not compatible with our sed usage in transformEnvironment.sh. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR implements the approach B of #3500 by adding a new `putAndAttach` method to `ArtifactStore`\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `ArtifactStore#putAndAttach` method and removes the `ArtifactStore#attach` method. Following are the main changes\r\n\r\n### Key points\r\n\r\n#### A - Refactor the flow to pass in old document\r\n\r\nFor old attachment to be removed we need access to old attachment name. To facilitate that refactoring has been done to pass in old document to `put` method. As for update we were anyway reading existing document first (to know the revision) this change does not introduce any extra calls\r\n\r\nFor `WhiskActivation` refactoring was reduced by passing `None` for old document as so activations are not updated\r\n\r\n#### B - Cache Update flow\r\n\r\nSee inline comments in code for details\r\n\r\n#### C - Attachment names as Uri\r\n\r\nThe attachmentName stored in document would be a Uri consisting of scheme and path. So the format would be\r\n\r\n    <scheme>:<attachment name/path >\r\n\r\nWhere\r\n\r\n* `scheme` - Would indicate where the attachment is stored or attachment store type. It can have values like\r\n    * `mem` - If attachment content is inlined in name itself (TBD)\r\n    * `couch` - If attachment is stored in CouchDB\r\n    * `s3` - If attachment is  stored in S3\r\n* attachment name/path - Is the actual attachment name in the storage\r\n\r\nFor e.g. with CouchDB the attachmentName Uri would be something like `couch:73d6c4cc-3670-4328-96c4-cc3670a328ac`\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\"code\": {\r\n      \"attachmentName\": \"couch:73d6c4cc-3670-4328-96c4-cc3670a328ac\",\r\n      \"attachmentType\": \"application/java-archive\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever the actual name of attachment would just be the path part.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"_attachments\": {\r\n    \"73d6c4cc-3670-4328-96c4-cc3670a328ac\": {\r\n      \"content_type\": \"application/java-archive\",\r\n      \"revpos\": 4,\r\n      \"digest\": \"md5-6PkVAZ00zzZKPoquAJj5Lw==\",\r\n      \"length\": 5,\r\n      \"stub\": true\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `readAttachment` flow would make use of scheme  to determine from where to read the attachment. This would help to support lazy migration of attachments to a different `AttachmentStore`\r\n\r\nFor e.g. we have an existing setup where attachments are stored in CouchDB. So attachment names would be like `jarfile` or `couch:some-uuid`. Now we can configure a `S3AttachmentStore` in this setup such that new attachments are stored in S3 while existing remain in CouchDB. So  in such a setup\r\n\r\n* Newer attachment writes would be routed to S3\r\n* On read side - Logic would check if scheme is `couch` then it would read it from CouchDB while if it is something else it would read from configured `AttachmentStore`\r\n\r\n#### D - Attachement Meta\r\n\r\nThe `Attached` class now supports 2 more attributes\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\n  case class Attached(attachmentName: String,\r\n                      attachmentType: ContentType,\r\n                      length: Option[Int] = None,\r\n                      digest: Option[String] = None)\r\n      extends Attachment[Nothing]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* length - Captures the length of attachment\r\n* digest - Digest of attachment with format \"<algorithm>-<digest value>\" e.g. \"md5-6PkVAZ00zzZKPoquAJj5Lw==\"\r\n\r\n##### Length and Digest for CouchDB AttachmentStore\r\n\r\nAs for CouchDB attachment storage we set the attachment properties first in the document and then upload the attachment its not possible to  set these value. For non CouchDB `AttachmentStores` this would be lot simpler as there its first upload and then attach. So there these values would be populated.\r\n\r\nSo for CouchDB these values are extracted at time of deserialization by having the deserializer look into `_attachments` sub document and extract  it from there. \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3500)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nTo support a cluster-aware deployment, the ContainerPool in invoker needs to a) be able to operate as a singleton with failover and b) be able to track state of containers within the cluster on all nodes\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis PR provides both, so that multiple invokers can be deployed while:\r\n* a single invoker is consuming from the invokers' topic (all invokers share the same topic)\r\n* in case of a failover, ContainerFactory impls have the opportunity to resurrect the ContainerPool freePool and prewarmPool, so that existing usable containers will remain usable.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nIncreasing the number of network threads in kafka solves the performance bottleneck on some deployments where the number of invokers is high. \r\nIf one deploys kafka with the default value of network threads (3), it would have only a couple of CPU that are fully utilized amid others that are idling, which could reduce the throughput for blocking and non-blocking invocations, it could setback even more dramatically if encryption is enabled. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes.

Description\r\nCurrent ansible processing looks for a docker log text string to determine if Kafka's running.  Unfortunately, this string can (and has) changed between versions of kafka.\r\n\r\nKafka registers its brokers with zookeeperer, so this this task checks the zookeeper node to determine whether kafka has started -- a likely to be much more forward-compatible approach.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [X] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

tests around (maximum) action time limit\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nMajor goals of this pull request:\r\n* Some tests use a Node.js based action `timeout.js` which uses a busy-wait loop keeping one full CPU busy while waiting. Introduce a new CPU-friendly sleep action `sleep.js` and replace `timeout.js`. This should make the affected tests faster or less brittle if they run on the same system where the test action is running.\r\n* #3379 introduced configurable maximum action time limits. When changing the maximum action time limit to a value higher than 5 minutes, the `MaxActionDurationTest` starts to fail because it contains hard-coded time limits. This PR Introduces new test actions `sleep.jar` (Java including source) and `sleep.py` (Python) which sleep as many milliseconds as specified during invocation.\r\n* Improve tests around (maximum) action time limit.\r\n* Move action creation tests with limits to `ActionLimitsTests` suite to have these tests in once place.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\nSee #3379.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [X] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nWhen the various action controllers were spun out into their own repositories, they took their test suites with them.  However, the original source code for the test suites was left in `incubator-openwhisk` .  That was fine until we started compiling JAR files to support testing and leaving them in local maven.  Now the JAR files including the actionController tests can create classpath conflicts with the test being compiled from the individual runtimes, challenging the validity of the tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR deletes the not-canonical versions of the tests from incubator-runtime.  There are certain utility classes that are duplicated among the runtime repos that should maybe eventually be factored further into an SDK, but for the moment simplicity in the test process is needed to ensure test validity.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [X] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nSince it seems we have essentially upgraded our deploy process to use Ansible 2.4.*, this PR goes through the various ansible files and replaces use of ‘include’ with use of ‘import_playbook’, ‘import_tasks’, or ‘include_tasks’ dependent upon the individual situations.\r\n\r\nIt eliminates the ugly warning Ansible 2.4 had been printing during the deployment process (hopefully without introducing any new ugliness).\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and

Description\r\nThe addition of SSL certificates for controller can leave a ‘*.csr’ file in ansible/roles/controller/files during build.  This file could inadvertently be added to Git if it is not ignored.  This PR adds `ansible/roles/controller/files/*.csr` to the .gitignore.  (Note:  Perhaps we need a unified approach to certificate management across the cluster — we seem to be making lots of them.)\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [X] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [X] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

a new SPI `AttachmentStore` with a `MemoryAttachmentStore` \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new `AttachmentStore` SPI with a `MemoryAttachmentStore` as an initial implementation. As part of this PR following aspect would be covered\r\n\r\n1. Capture the SPI contract as part of `AttachmentStoreBehaviors` test specification. This suite would need to be passed by all SPI implementations\r\n2. Refactor the current `CouchDbRestStore` to make use of an _optional_ `AttachmentStore`. \r\n3. Possibly implement another store based on S3/Azure/IBM Objects etc in a separate PR\r\n\r\n## Key design aspects\r\n\r\nCurrently the attachments are only used for `WhiskEntities`. A setup can use same `AttachmentStore` for all entities or use different stores. \r\n\r\n### BlobId\r\n\r\nA possible implementation for say S3 can use same S3 bucket to store attachments for all stores. It would use following format for blobId \r\n\r\n    <namespace>/<docId>/<name>\r\n\r\n* namespace - Derived from entity classType like `whiskauth`, `whiskactivation`. `AttachmentStoreProvider` can determine this based on `ClassTag`\r\n* docId - DocumentId of the document with which the attachment is attached\r\n* name - Name of attachment\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\n`AttachmentStore` would not support revision based storage and would only work with `DocId`. To enable such a design attachments were made immutable (#3502)\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\n\r\nRefactored `CouchDBRestStore` is backward compatible. For e.g. if a system has been running so far with `CouchDBRestStore` and storing attachments in Couch and later configured with an `S3AttachmentStore` then old attachments would still be read from CouchDB and only newer attachments which were stored in S3 would be read from there.\r\n\r\nThis is made possible by encoding the attachment storage as scheme in attachmentNames stored as part of entity.\r\n\r\n### Digest and Length\r\n\r\n`AttachmentStore` would need to compute the `SHA-256` digest and length of the attachment as part of upload and return it as part of `attached` call\r\n\r\nThese metadata would be later used to say decide how and when to cache attachments on disk.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this

`padTo` (used when generating the list of semaphores for all invokers) does not recompute the value each time it adds an element to the underlying list. That resulted in **all** invokers-state being backed by the same Semaphore and thus not doing anything properly really.\r\n2. The stepsizes need to be calculated for the list of invokers they are used to step to. Therefore we need a seperate list of step-sizes for the managed and the blackbox invoker list.\r\n3. The assumption should be, that we freed our resources (and thus updated the state) **before** we return the request to the user. A minor change in code order is warranted here.\r\n4. In the overload case we need to take the index we want to schedule to out of the `healthyInvokers` list, rather than using the `random` value directly. The `healthyInvokers` list might be shorter/in a different order than the list of all underlying invokers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this adds a useful metric to determine (from the loadbalancers point-of-view) how many activations are currently running in the system. That can be used to determine overall system utilization.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Markus Thömmes <markusthoemmes@me.com>\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [X] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [X] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n- Fixed an issue where empty results from K8S log HTTP could cause a downstream error propagation\r\n- Moved the last entry timestamp update up before the CompleteAfterOccurrences stage.\r\n  When it was below, it meant that we never saw the activation marker Lines\r\n  missing the marker lines meant the last timestamp we saved was only from\r\n  valid logging, and we kept refetching the past activation lines\r\n- On occasions Kubernetes didn't have invoker logs ready at request, it\r\n  would simply stop; fixed code to retry. However, there's no pause If no results\r\n  come back from Kubernetes, retry until they do.\r\n\r\nSwitched K8S Logging Graph Stage to a Timer based one.\r\n- With this, added a retry scheduler to delay 100 ms when the logs come back empty.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- I opened an issue, #3439, describing the problem.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
