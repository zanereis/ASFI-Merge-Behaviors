running a workflow with the Spark Runner with BoundedSources, files are only split on the defaultParallelism. When accessing HDFS in native Spark it defaults to partitioning based on the HDFS block size (my understanding). I believe that there should be a configurable bundleSize to split BoundedSources so that a larger file corresponds to more splits rather than a large file corresponding to larger splits as happens now.\r\n\r\nSpark Runner Code Owner: @jbonofre \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR fixes two issues mentioned above.\r\n\r\nBEAM-3359: I'm not sure if we need to use TestFlinkRunner at all but on the other hand I found it super easy to allow passing flinkMaster to TestPipeline runner. Because it doesn't fail any tests, I find it valuable change. It is very hard to debug \"why flinkMaster is not set when I'm using TestFlinkRunner\" otherwise.\r\n\r\nBEAM:3370: this change is inspired on the Dataflow runner implementation although not an exact one. I'm not sure if tempLocation is the best place to save the jar that is produced from directories with compiled classes. I also had doubts about whether to delete it or not. Dataflow runner does not delete, but stages it in \"stagingLocation\" on gs filesystem. Should I use an analogous option in Flink for that and behave the same way?\r\n\r\n@aljoscha @lukecwik could you take a look? \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

BeamSqlRowComparator a bit to make it can return comparison results in either forward order or reversed order.\r\n\r\nIn the past, BeamSqlRowComparator only returned comparison results in reversed order. It was because BeamSortRel only supports `ORDER BY LIMIT` by using `Top` (`Top` by default returns elements in descending order). For example, if there is a query `SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1`,  and assuming there are two rows in table with id `1` and `2` separately, in order to return the right result by using `Top`,  `BeamSqlRowComparator` have to tell `Top` that the row with id `1` is bigger (which means comparator returns in reversed order).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to support [ORDER BY ASC and ORDER BY DESC](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5064), there is a need to have a comparator that returns in forward order (if 1 < 2, then returns -1 to indicate 1 < 2). So in this PR,  BeamSqlRowComparator is changed to achieve this goal. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

now we configure `RelCollationTraitDef` in `BeamQueryPlanner` but seems like we don't use/implement it. However this configuration causes `SortRemoveRule` to apply sort to SortRel's input and then drop the SorRel (which does not really sort the SortRel's input). \r\n\r\nRemove `RelCollationTraitDef`and disable `SortRemoveRule` for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf don't remove CollationTrait, one example is:\r\n```\r\nINFO: SQLPlan>\r\nBeamIOSinkRel(table=[[beam, ORDER_ID_TABLE]], operation=[INSERT], flattened=[true])\r\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0], dir0=[ASC])\r\n    LogicalProject(order_id=[$0])\r\n      BeamIOSourceRel(table=[[beam, ORDER_DETAILS]])\r\n\r\nAug 03, 2018 1:07:24 PM org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.sql.impl.BeamQueryPlanner convertToBeamRel\r\nINFO: BEAMPlan>\r\nBeamIOSinkRel(table=[[beam, ORDER_ID_TABLE]], operation=[INSERT], flattened=[true])\r\n  BeamCalcRel(expr#0..3=[{inputs}], order_id=[$t0])\r\n    BeamIOSourceRel(table=[[beam, ORDER_DETAILS]])\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

Beam SQL didn't aggregate nulls properly, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- [{x: null, y: 1}, {x: 1, y: 1}, {x: 2, y: 1}]\r\nSELECT COUNT(x) FROM PCOLLECTION GROUP BY y\r\n-- got: 3\r\n-- expected: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons:\r\n- it didn't pass the value of `Schema.Field#getNullable` to Calcite data type, and Calcite optimized `COUNT(x)` to `COUNT()`\r\n- it didn't handle nulls in `BeamAggregationTransforms`, that is relevant for `AVG`, `SUM`, etc.\r\n\r\nYou can find more examples of broken queries in `BeamSqlDslAggregationNullableTest`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License
