up with PR #38717, this PR adds a pre-commit hook\r\nto keep the tags list sorted in the OpenAPI spec yaml.\r\n\r\nI previously tried to use the pyyaml library, to find the tags \r\nand rewrite sorted tags, but upon rewrite it does not maintain\r\nthe original order of components in the YAML thus creating\r\nhuge changes for the PR to review. Hence, taking a simple\r\napproach to read the file line by line, find the indexes of the\r\nstart entry and end entry of the tags list, sort those specific lines\r\nand rewrite the lines with the sorted list of tags.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR fixes the calculation of the scheduling decision if upstream to a teardown task an individual task is reset (w/o resetting all downstream!) but the direct upstream tasks of the teardown are completed.\r\n\r\nAs reported in #29332 in such case as direct upstream dependencies of teardown tasks  were completed, teardown was starting too early.\r\n\r\nWith this fix teardown scheduling evaluates all upstream dependencies if any upstream is not completed.\r\n\r\nHow to test?\r\n- Use the DAG in the comments of the bug report #29332 and deploy this\r\n- Run this DAG (at least once) till success\r\n- Clear the first normal task w/o clearing downstream\r\n- See that teardown is scheduled only if the cleared task is completed (before this PR it is immediately scheduled after setup was completed in parallel to the actual cleared task\r\n\r\ncloses: #29332\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-05T22:21:50Z","updated_at":"2024-11-08T00:14:50Z","closed_at":"2024-11-08T00:14:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

airflow, indicate that something really bad happen.\r\nI guess it might be suitable for cases when we use `RuntimeError` which could be easily ignored by something like\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    something\r\nexcept Exception:\r\n    pass # Ha-ha!\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course it is not protected over the worst practices like\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    something\r\nexcept:\r\n    pass # ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst candidate it is special helper for Non-DB tests which right now raise RuntimeError, unfortunetly some of tests might internally expects Runtime Error, some still catch Exception or internals of it just preserve any regular exception so we can't detect this tests.\r\n\r\nI expect couple / tens / hundreds tests are failed during first iteration. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please

preparing for presentation about modernizing packaging setup I found out that we can slightly improve editable installation of airflow. So far we required a \"devel\" installation in order to make a working editable installation of airflow (because the devel extra was installing dependencies for all the pre-installed providers).\r\n\r\nHowever that required to synchronize the list of providers installed in `devel` dependency with the list of preinstalled providers, as well as it made `pip install -e .` resulting with a non-working version of Airflow (because it requires `fab` provider dependencies to start airflow webserver).\r\n\r\nThis PR improves it - in editable mode, instead of adding the pre-installed providers, we add their dependencies. This way we can remove the pre-installed providers from the list of devel providers to install - because now the pre-installed provider dependencies are installed simply as \"required\" dependencies.\r\n\r\nAs a result - simple `pip install -e .` should now result in fully working airflow installation - without all the devel goodies and without celery and kubernetes dependencies, but fully usable for sequential and local executor cases.\r\n\r\nAlso reviewed and updated the comments in hatch_build.py to better reflect the purpose and behaviour of some of the methods there.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

new Google Cloud Bigquery released few days ago, caused some weird backtracking UV issue for Python 3.11 builds where airflow uses PyPI providers in PROD image builds. UV seems to fail on really old version of google-cloud-bigquery (1.28.2) that has a bad version specifier for one of the dependencies (de instead of dev).\r\n\r\nWe should add the google-cloud-bigquery explicitly and limit it to a relatively newer version. Airflow uses latest 3.20.1 version now in constraints and limiting bigquery to >= 3.0.1 (first non-yanked version released > 2 years ago in March 2022) is a good lower limit.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

main we are using `uv` to build CI and PROD images to gain enormous speed improvements. This helps with faster PR checks and iterations and lowers the CI cost. However `uv` is not entirely stable yet and there are conditions that make it fail sometimes (for example when old packages, not excluded by our limits are published with wrong versions), also release imge is built with `pip` and will continue to be built with `pip`. The gains for PROD iumage builds with uv are much smaller than the ones for CI builds, so it's perfectly fine to switch all `release branch` builds to use `pip` for PROD image builds - we do not loose too much by doing it, but we gain stability.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

uv docker build is run in WSL2 the default timeout does not cope well with downloading big packages and times-out with the default UV timeout. This PR performs detection of whether you are in a WSL environment and changes the timeout in case you are in WSL2. It also raises error when WSL1 is detected (not supported by Breeze at all). In case the WSL1 detection is wrong we also have an escape hatch by manually specifying `--uv-http-timeout`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

UV_REQUEST_TIMEOUT was only briefly the correct parameter name, (UV 1.6.0). It is still working as a fallback, but the right parameter name is UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT. This PR renames the flag and build args/env variables appropriately - and also fixes a few annoyances connected with this parameter:\r\n\r\n* it was not possible to specify --use-uv/uv-timout for `breeze` `breeze shell` and `breeze start-airflow` commands which could resut in rebuilding the image and you had to rebuild image manually with `ci-image build` if you wanted to change uv/no-uv\r\n\r\n* the ARG was not properly passed in PROD image and resulted in empty string set as UV_REQUEST_TIMEOUT which resulted with a warning printed by UV and falling back to default 300\r\n\r\n* we have now global constant for default timeout\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This resulted in a not expected partially empty screen in the dag menu.\r\n\r\nThe fix resolves the issue by disabling both the \"Clear Task\" and \"Mark state as…\" buttons when the user lacks permission, same as the behavior when the user can't edit on DAGs.\r\n\r\nNow, in 'views.py', an additional meta named 'can_edit_taskintances' is passed to 'grid.html' based on the user's task instance edit permission, same as the meta 'can_edit' from user's dag edit permission defined in 'dag.html'.\r\n\r\nBoth 'canEdit' and 'canEditTaskInstances' definitions were moved inside the React components. This was necessary just for the variables to be mockable during testing, as these variables were defined before the component was loaded.","created_at":"2024-04-04T01:58:33Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T15:43:54Z","closed_at":"2024-05-31T15:43:51Z","merged_at":"2024-05-31T15:43:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"c8c97b5067468683a5eb44b1a5e3ff6966025e5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

This condition is correct, except for the case where `run_as_user` has been set to user as which Airflow is already running, in which case [`run_as_user` is ignored when the TaskRunner is initialialized](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/task/task_runner/base_task_runner.py#L74).\r\n\r\nThis means that whenever an Airflow user sets `run_as_user` to the user as which they're already running Airflow, [they would get an error](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/38128#discussioncomment-8806266), and be told to unset the `run_as_user` attribute. However, there is a legitimate use case for this: `run_as_user` can be used to override `default_impersonation` back to the `airflow_uid` user. \r\n\r\nThis change updates the \"is_child_process\" condition within the exception handler to reflect this use case. It makes this use case succeed silently instead of throwing an error.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull

executemany parameter to the insert_rows method to allow you to choose which strategy to apply when inserting rows as the executemany method is way much faster than the original implementation.  You can see this in the picture above when we did the performance comparison with thousands of records inserted in bulk, the penultimate one in red took already 13 minutes (so we killed it) and wasn't even finished while the last one with the executemany strategy was completed in merely a few minutes.  So I decided to create this new pull request and always apply the faster executemany strategy, as the operator using the hook didn't have any way to change that property anyway and there wasn't anything foreseen to configure that parameter in the connection too. Also why keep both strategies if one is better than the other, then it's better to ditch the slower one which makes the code less complex and easier to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

Airflow installs a pre-release provider version we can add the `>=x.y.zdev0` or `>=x.y.zrc1` to pre-release provider specification.\r\n\r\nThis is necessary to install dev0 or rc* packages when we release them for testing, when the pre-installed provider is a \"chicken-egg\" provider that does not yet have an \"official\" version - because otherwise the dependency would not allow the provider to be installed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the \"final\" package should have just `>=x.y.z` without the pre-release specification, because by the time we release the final version, the pre-release provider package should be already released.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements such pre-release stripping. In cse we prepare the \"final\" version of the airflow package, all the preinstalled provider's specifications got the `>=version` stripped off all the prerelease information. The `>=1.2.0dev0` or `>=1.2.0rc1` is for example turned into `>=1.2.0`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

think it is needed to be ensure that the metrics_allow_list and metrics_block_list are added to the StatsD pod's environment variables. This update is crucial for refreshing the pod configuration effectively.\r\n\r\nInitially configuring the StatsD pod without these lists and adding them later can lead to inconsistencies. Specifically, while changes to metrics_allow_list or metrics_block_list update the airflow.cfg and trigger a refresh of the related Airflow components (like the scheduler and webserver), the StatsD pod does not get automatically updated because its configuration remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nThis behavior results in the metrics not being updated according to the newly set rules, although the fields themselves are not deleted—they simply stop updating. For example, when using the StatsD scraper for Prometheus, I noticed that metrics intended to be blocked were still present, albeit without updates. Initially, I suspected an issue with the block list and allow list functionality, but it turned out that the real issue was the StatsD pod not being refreshed, causing the old metric fields to persist.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it seems logical to include these configurations directly in the StatsD pod's environment variables, ensuring the pod is replaced and updated whenever these settings are configured.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
