href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protobuf Release v3.16.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/b8c2488f480bbe3d66b9874c2fcd434201caa48a\"><code>b8c2488</code></a> Updating version.json and repo version numbers to: 16.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/42e47e5a3fa7219b136f6a5de7c74a89a79245c6\"><code>42e47e5</code></a> Refactoring Java parsing (3.16.x) (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10668\">#10668</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/98884a8a293488375e10480e5ff1c1f76de9ec8f\"><code>98884a8</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10556\">#10556</a> from deannagarcia/3.16.x</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/450b648f288f9a6def073f08e3300233bb46c5dd\"><code>450b648</code></a> Cherrypick ruby fixes for monterey</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/b17bb392b46a7bc9d09ae075dc5e8557e246698d\"><code>b17bb39</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10548\">#10548</a> from protocolbuffers/3.16.x-202209131829</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/c18f5e71d86063fd6cea2c47cd7ab4131db5c9e2\"><code>c18f5e7</code></a> Updating changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/6f4e81791d390cba199184c378e75da40a4965f0\"><code>6f4e817</code></a> Updating version.json and repo version numbers to: 16.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/a7d4e94a4666b722695d9c55ac842d4a3735699e\"><code>a7d4e94</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10547\">#10547</a> from deannagarcia/3.16.x</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/55815e423bb82cc828836bbd60c79c1f9a195763\"><code>55815e4</code></a> Apply patch</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/152d7bf809dcb24fd9d417d66cf2b270b3654369\"><code>152d7bf</code></a> Update version.json with &quot;lts&quot;: true (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10535\">#10535</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/compare/v3.16.1...v3.16.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java&package-manager=maven&previous-version=3.16.1&new-version=3.16.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nYou can trigger a rebase of this PR by commenting `@dependabot rebase`.\n\n[//]: # (dependabot-automerge-start)\n[//]: # (dependabot-automerge-end)\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>Dependabot commands and options</summary>\n<br />\n\nYou can trigger Dependabot actions by commenting on this PR:\n- `@dependabot rebase` will rebase this PR\n- `@dependabot recreate` will recreate this PR, overwriting any edits that have been made to it\n- `@dependabot merge` will merge this PR after your CI passes on it\n- `@dependabot squash and merge` will squash and merge this PR after your CI passes on it\n- `@dependabot cancel merge` will cancel a previously requested merge and block automerging\n- `@dependabot reopen` will reopen this PR if it is closed\n- `@dependabot close` will close this PR and stop Dependabot recreating it.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager. (6e0c5b5d50)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>28.2</h2>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;28.2-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;28.2-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.1</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve performance characteristics of UnknownFieldSet parsing (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9371\">#9371</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.0</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings issue found in conformance_test_runner <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8189\">#8189</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8190\">#8190</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix MinGW-w64 build issues.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager. (6e0c5b5d50)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>28.2</h2>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;28.2-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;28.2-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

PR adds explicit [permissions section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised

What is this PR for?\r\nNow In test cases `JDBCInterpreterTest.testMultiTenant_1` and `JDBCInterpreterTest.testMultiTenant_1`, the jdbc interpreter would try to connect h2 databases with 3 non-existed user.  Although It does not affect the running of the entire test case, it has two consequences:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It would cost more time to execute these two test case. The execution time of every test case time would be reduced from over 1 second to 50 milliseconds if the users is exsited.\r\n\r\n2. And also the interpreter would log a long message about `JdbcSQLInvalidAuthorizationSpecException` ,  which may mislead developer who is unfamiliar to JDBC module into thinking there is something wrong with the test case.

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>v3.10.1 2022-08-02</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add sponsorship files.\n<ul>\n<li>If you appreciate the time spent maintaining JSZip then I would really appreciate <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/Stuk\">your sponsorship</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consolidate metadata types and expose OnUpdateCallback <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/851\">#851</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/852\">#852</a></li>\n<li>use <code>const</code> instead <code>var</code> in example from README.markdown <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/828\">#828</a></li>\n<li>Switch manual download link to HTTPS <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/839\">#839</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Internals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace jshint with eslint <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/842\">#842</a></li>\n<li>Add performance tests <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/834\">#834</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.10.0 2022-05-20</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Change setimmediate dependency to more efficient one. Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/issues/617\">Stuk/jszip#617</a> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/829\">#829</a>)</li>\n<li>Update types of <code>currentFile</code> metadata to include <code>null</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/826\">#826</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.9.1 2022-04-06</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix recursive definition of <code>InputFileFormat</code> introduced in 3.9.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.9.0 2022-04-04</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Update types JSZip#loadAsync to accept a promise for data, and remove arguments from <code>new JSZip()</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/752\">#752</a>)</li>\n<li>Update types for <code>compressionOptions</code> to JSZipFileOptions and JSZipGeneratorOptions (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/722\">#722</a>)</li>\n<li>Add types for <code>generateInternalStream</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/774\">#774</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.8.0 2022-03-30</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Santize filenames when files are loaded with <code>loadAsync</code>, to avoid <a href=\"https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability\">&quot;zip slip&quot; attacks</a>. The original filename is available on each zip entry as <code>unsafeOriginalName</code>. See the <a href=\"https://stuk.github.io/jszip/documentation/api_jszip/load_async.html\">documentation</a>. Many thanks to McCaulay Hudson for reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.7.1 2021-08-05</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix build of <code>dist</code> files.\n<ul>\n<li>Note: this version ensures the changes from 3.7.0 are actually included in the <code>dist</code> files. Thanks to Evan W for reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.7.0 2021-07-23</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Use a null prototype object for this.files  (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/766\">#766</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>This change might break existing code if it uses prototype methods on the <code>.files</code> property of a zip object, for example <code>zip.files.toString()</code>. This approach is taken to prevent files in the zip overriding object methods that would exist on a normal object.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.6.0 2021-02-09</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: redirect main to dist on browsers (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/742\">#742</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix duplicate require DataLengthProbe, utils (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/734\">#734</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix small error in read_zip.md (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/703\">#703</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.5.0 2020-05-31</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/Stuk\">your sponsorship</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consolidate metadata types and expose OnUpdateCallback <a

instead <code>var</code> in example from README.markdown <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/828\">#828</a></li>\n<li>Switch manual download link to HTTPS <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/839\">#839</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Internals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace jshint with eslint <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/842\">#842</a></li>\n<li>Add performance tests <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/834\">#834</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.10.0 2022-05-20</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Change setimmediate dependency to more efficient one. Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/issues/617\">Stuk/jszip#617</a> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/829\">#829</a>)</li>\n<li>Update types of <code>currentFile</code> metadata to include <code>null</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/826\">#826</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.9.1 2022-04-06</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix recursive definition of <code>InputFileFormat</code> introduced in 3.9.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.9.0 2022-04-04</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Update types JSZip#loadAsync to accept a promise for data, and remove arguments from <code>new JSZip()</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/752\">#752</a>)</li>\n<li>Update types for <code>compressionOptions</code> to JSZipFileOptions and JSZipGeneratorOptions (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/722\">#722</a>)</li>\n<li>Add types for <code>generateInternalStream</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/774\">#774</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.8.0 2022-03-30</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Santize filenames when files are loaded with <code>loadAsync</code>, to avoid <a href=\"https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability\">&quot;zip slip&quot; attacks</a>. The original filename is available on each zip entry as <code>unsafeOriginalName</code>. See the <a href=\"https://stuk.github.io/jszip/documentation/api_jszip/load_async.html\">documentation</a>. Many thanks to McCaulay Hudson for reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.7.1 2021-08-05</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix build of <code>dist</code> files.\n<ul>\n<li>Note: this version ensures the changes from 3.7.0 are actually included in the <code>dist</code> files. Thanks to Evan W for reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.7.0 2021-07-23</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Use a null prototype object for this.files  (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/766\">#766</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>This change might break existing code if it uses prototype methods on the <code>.files</code> property of a zip object, for example <code>zip.files.toString()</code>. This approach is taken to prevent files in the zip overriding object methods that would exist on a normal object.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.6.0 2021-02-09</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: redirect main to dist on browsers (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/742\">#742</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix duplicate require DataLengthProbe, utils (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/734\">#734</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix small error in read_zip.md (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/703\">#703</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.5.0 2020-05-31</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to improve a some step in Frontend CI jobs.\r\n\r\nThere are two command in this step in file `frontend.yml`  as follow:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/f42943c6d5bc04498b7fc9ca518dc433091a9c9c/.github/workflows/frontend.yml#L123-L125\r\n\r\nThe first command would `mvn install` many modules including the submodule of  `zeppelin-plugins`.\r\nThe second command would `mvn package`  `zeppelin-plugins`.\r\n\r\nActually, we only need to `mvn package` module  `zeppelin-plugins` one time instead of to install then to package it, which would save running time of CI.\r\nAnd there is no need to `mvn install` module  `zeppelin-plugins` , which may bring something unexpected. `mvn package` is enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira [ZEPPELIN-5815](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5815)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCI passed\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

There has never been any Docker image named `zeppelin-interpreter` or `zeppelin-server`.\r\n- The latest version also should be 0.10.1\r\n\r\n### What is this PR for?\r\nA few sentences describing the overall goals of the pull request's commits.\r\nFirst time? Check out the contributing guide - https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html\r\n\r\nAll the examples inside and outside Zeppelin website/docs point to simply using `zeppelin-server.yaml` for K8s cluster : \r\n```sh\r\ncurl -s -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/zeppelin/master/k8s/zeppelin-server.yaml\r\nkubectl apply -f zeppelin-server.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are lots of issues on StackOverFlow and 1 on Jira that indicate the Docker images mentioned in this YAML simply don't exist on Docker Hub. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nDocumentation\r\n*Please leave your type of PR only*\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/\r\n* Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5191\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Strongly recommended: add automated unit tests for any new or changed behavior\r\n* Outline any manual steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\nI have tested this on a live K8s cluster (OpenStack) and it created a Zeppelin server successfully, also creates Spark and other interpreters in

What is this PR for?\r\nAdd **cross datasource query** support to Spark SQL interpreter, currently support cross datasource query with these datasources:\r\n\r\n- hive\r\n- jdbc\r\n- mongodb\r\n\r\n#### How to Use\r\n1. User should declare a cross datasource table in format: `interpreterName.databaseName.tableName`.\r\n2. `interpreterName` should exists in zeppelin interpreter configuration.\r\n3. For JDBC datasource, jdbc driver jars should be included in dependencies.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement cross datasource query with catalog for spark 3.x\r\n\r\n### Need Help\r\n#### 1. Is there a better way to load all interpreter settings:\r\n\r\nCurrently inplement by reading interpreter settings list inside zengine module and pass this list to Spark SQL interpreter. So this pull request include 2 modules:\r\n\r\n1. `zeppelin-zengine`: read and pass all interpreter settings to Spark SQL interpreter\r\n2. `spark-interpreter`: add Spark SQL cross datasource query\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen spark is launch with `local` or `yarn-client` mode, it is easy to load interpreter settings list inside `spark-interpreter` and we do not need to make a change to `zeppelin-zengine`, but when you luanch spark interpreter in `yarn-cluster` mode, `interpreter.json` do not exists in yarn-cluster driver node, so you can not get interpreter settings. So I made a change to `zeppelin-zengine` to read and pass all interpreter settings to Spark SQL interpreter, and this works in `yarn-cluster` mode.\r\n\r\nI think it is not good to make change to zengine, is there a better way to get all interpreter settings in `yarn-cluster` mode without make change to `zengine` ?\r\n\r\n#### 2. How to distinguish between user and role in `option.owners` field of interpreter setting?\r\n\r\nI cannot distinguish user and role inside `option.owners` field of interpreter setting and datasource authorization check is implemented with these code:\r\n```java\r\nHashSet<String> usersAndRoles = new HashSet<>(authenticationInfo.getUsersAndRoles());\r\nHashSet<String> owners = new HashSet<>(iSetting.option.owners);\r\n// if owners is empty, means all users can access\r\nif(!owners.isEmpty()){\r\n  int size1 = owners.size();\r\n  owners.retainAll(usersAndRoles);\r\n  int size2 = owners.size();\r\n  if(size1 == size2){\r\n    // no user or role match\r\n    throw new InvalidCredentialsException(String.format(String.format(\"user %s has not privilege to access interpreter %s\",authenticationInfo.getUser(), interpreterId)));\r\n  }\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there is any security concern, how can I make a better authentication check ?\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-5781]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. make sure sparkSQL-interepreter(`%sql`) works \r\n2. config a jdbc / mongodb interpreter with name `interpreter-nameX`\r\n3. test query jdbc/mongodb in %sql:\r\n```sql\r\n%sql\r\nselect * from interpreter-nameX.databaseName.tableName;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if

What is this PR for?\r\nMost broken links have been updated with links from the latest documentation. However, in the case of cdh.md and cron_schduler.md, I modified it in a different way.\r\nFor cdh.md, the Cloudera official document disappeared. so i replaced it with a docker hub site with the same content. And  for cron_scheduler.md, I replaced it with the version 2.2.2 site to match version 2.2.x.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\nDocumentation\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira
