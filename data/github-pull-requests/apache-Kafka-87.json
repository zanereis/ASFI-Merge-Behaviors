cancelled. If the broker do not autocreate the topic, and the connector is not configured to create topics written by the source connector, then the `WorkerSourceTask` main thread will block forever until the topic is created, and will not stop if cancelled or scheduled for shutdown by the worker.\r\n\r\nExpanded an existing unit test for the WorkerSourceTask class to ensure that the producer is closed when the task is abandoned, and added a new integration test that guarantees that tasks are still shut down even when their producers are trying to write to topics that do not exist.","created_at":"2021-03-01T16:37:54Z","updated_at":"2021-05-05T18:07:08Z","closed_at":"2021-05-05T18:07:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f22998b41243ddc962eda19d0473d9a2d052780","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/931fc4f610db5162b05497c8e0278494e8195b32","head":{"label":"rhauch:kafka-10340-2.8","ref":"kafka-10340-2.8","sha":"931fc4f610db5162b05497c8e0278494e8195b32","user":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40898643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDg5ODY0Mw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"rhauch/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch/kafka","description":"Mirror

system test in `delegation_token_test.py` broke due to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10199/. \r\n That patch changed the logic of `SecurityConfig.enabled_sasl_mechanisms()` to only add the inter-broker SASL mechanism when the inter-broker protocol was `SASL_{PLAINTEXT,SSL}`.  The inter-broker protocol is `PLAINTEXT` in `delegation_token_test.py`, so the default inter-broker SASL mechanism of `GSSAPI` was not being added into the set returned by `enabled_sasl_mechanisms()`.  This is actually correct -- it shouldn't be added if it isn't used for inter-broker communication.  It should be added because clients use it, of course -- `SASL_PLAINTEXT` is the security protocol on an advertised listener, and `client_sasl_mechanism` is set to the .csv value `\"GSSAPI,SCRAM-SHA-256\"`in `delegation_token_test`.  Unfortunately in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10199/ we did not take into account the possibility that `client_sasl_mechanism` could be a .csv value, and we therefore fail to create a `krb5.conf` file, which causes `kafka-delegation_tokens.sh` to fail.  This bug of .csv omission therefore uncovered a different bug -- we were relying on the default inter-broker SASL mechanism to signal that Kerberos was being used even though the inter-broker protocol wasn't SASL.  This patch explicitly includes the elements of the `client_sasl_mechanism` .csv value (which in most cases is just a single value but in `delegation_token_test` it is not).\r\n\r\n### Committer

need to wait for the translation state changed to `READY` to start consuming the records. But we didn't have any way to change the transationManager state in client, so we can just wait. I've confirmed that if we try another time, we can pass the tests. My test code is like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nvar isFailed = false\r\n    try {\r\n      pollRecordsUntilTrue(consumer, pollAction,\r\n        waitTimeMs = waitTimeMs,\r\n        msg = s\"Consumed ${records.size} records before timeout instead of the expected $numRecords records\")\r\n    } catch {\r\n      case e: AssertionFailedError => {\r\n        isFailed = true\r\n        System.err.println(s\"Consumed ${records.size} records before timeout instead of the expected $numRecords records\")\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (isFailed) {\r\n      pollRecordsUntilTrue(consumer, pollAction,\r\n        waitTimeMs = 30000,\r\n        msg = s\"Consumed ${records.size} records before timeout instead of the expected $numRecords records\")\r\n\r\n      // if we go to this step, it means it passed in 2nd try\r\n      fail(\"failed at 1st try\")\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd they failed with `failed at 1st try`, which confirmed that we can pass the tests by increasing the timeout. Currently, we wait 15 seconds, increase to 30 seconds.

ZooKeeper version of this system test is failing because the producer is no longer seeing `LEADER_NOT_AVAILABLE`. When the broker sees a METADATA request for the test topic after it restarts the auto topic creation manager is determining that the topic needs to be created due to the TLS hostname verification failure on the inter-broker security protocol.  It also thinks there aren't enough brokers available to meet the default topic replication factor (it sees 0 available due to the TLS issue), so it returns`INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR` for that topic in the Metadata response. In other words, the flow has changed and the inability to produce is not manifesting as it was before, and the test is failing.  This patch updates the test to check for `INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR` instead of `LEADER_NOT_AVAILABLE`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

any id that isn't actively being used by a non-DEAD thread in the `threads` list is fair game. This is relevant in two scenarios:\r\n\r\n`REPLACE_THREAD`: when choosing to replace a thread after a recoverable error, we should just grab a new (and free) thread.id rather than reusing the id of the dying thread, to avoid a race condition between the old thread shutting down and the new thread starting up. \r\n\r\n`#removeStreamThread()`: in this case, if we haven't explicitly waited for the thread to complete the shutdown, then we should not remove it from the `threads` list since this will allow reusing that thread.id. This can happen if a thread is removing itself, or if we timed out waiting for it to reach the `DEAD` state.\r\n\r\nIn all of these scenarios, the `threads` list is considered the source of truth about available thread.ids. When trying to start up a new thread and computing the next available id, we'll trim any `DEAD` threads from this list\r\n\r\nShould be cherrypicked to the 2.8 branch cc @vvcephei

7.0 is required for Java 16 compatibility and it removes a number of\r\ndeprecated APIs. Fix most issues preventing the upgrade to Gradle 7.0.\r\nThe remaining ones are more complicated and should be handled\r\nin a separate PR. Details of the changes:\r\n\r\n* Release tarball no longer includes includes test, sources, javadoc and test sources jars (these\r\nare still published to the Maven Central repository).\r\n* Replace `compile` with `api` or `implementation` - note that `implementation`\r\ndependencies appear with `runtime` scope in the pom file so this is a (positive)\r\nchange in behavior\r\n* Add missing dependencies that were uncovered by the usage of `implementation`\r\n* Replace `testCompile` with `testImplementation`\r\n* Replace `runtime` with `runtimeOnly` and `testRuntime` with `testRuntimeOnly`\r\n* Replace `configurations.runtime` with `configurations.runtimeClasspath`\r\n* Replace `configurations.testRuntime` with `configurations.testRuntimeClasspath` (except for\r\nthe usage in the `streams` project as that causes a cyclic dependency error)\r\n* Use `java-library` plugin instead of `java`\r\n* Use `maven-publish` plugin instead of deprecated `maven` plugin - this changes the\r\ncommands used to publish and to install locally, but task aliases for `install` and\r\n`uploadArchives` were added for backwards compatibility\r\n* Removed `-x signArchives` line from the readme since it was wrong (it was a\r\nno-op before and it fails now, however)\r\n* Replaces `artifacts` block with an approach that works with the `maven-publish` plugin\r\n* Don't publish `jmh-benchmark` module - the shadow jar is pretty large and not\r\nparticularly useful (before this PR, we would publish the non shadow jars)\r\n* Replace `version` with `archiveVersion`, `baseName` with `archiveBaseName` and\r\n`classifier` with `archiveClassifier`\r\n* Update Gradle and plugins to the latest stable version (7.0 is not stable yet)\r\n* Use `plugin` DSL to configure plugins\r\n* Updated notable changes for 3.0\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-24T16:37:31Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T15:47:25Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T19:22:22Z","merged_at":"2021-03-04T19:22:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a3ebbebbc6aed2049f22c650a52f6f685546207","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9c35471aefcf0e28cc3ae956d91ab3207c2879e7","head":{"label":"ijuma:gradle-7.0-ready","ref":"gradle-7.0-ready","sha":"9c35471aefcf0e28cc3ae956d91ab3207c2879e7","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32646946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjY0Njk0Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"ijuma/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma/kafka","description":"Mirror

Implements the KIP-631 config `sasl.mechanism.controller.protocol`\r\n- Updates `KafkaRaftManager` to use the first entry in `controller.listener.names` to determine the listener name; that listener name's mapped value in the `listener.security.protocol.map` (if such a mapping exists, otherwise the listener name itself) for the security protocol; and the value of `sasl.mechanism.controller.protocol` for the SASL mechanism.  Prior to this patch it was incorrectly using inter-broker security information when it connects to the Raft controller quorum.\r\n- Updates `RaftControllerNodeProvider` to use the value of `sasl.mechanism.controller.protocol` instead of the inter-broker sasl mechanism (it was already determining the listener name and security protocol correctly)\r\n- Updates system tests in `tests/kafkatest/tests/core/security_test.py` to correctly test various TLS hostname verification scenarios for Raft controller quorums, and includes new tests to confirm that hostname verification failures to both a Raft metadata quorum and a ZooKeeper quorum prevent Kafka from starting.  The system tests now exercise the changes to `KafkaRaftManager` and `RaftControllerNodeProvider` described above.\r\n- Adds system tests in `tests/kafkatest/sanity_checks/test_verifiable_producer.py`

reason why the test sometimes failed with: `TopicExistsException: Topic 'primary.test-topic-2' already exists.` is because we tried to create the topic that the MM2 already help us created. That is, \r\n```java\r\nprimary.kafka().createTopic(\"test-topic-2\", NUM_PARTITIONS);\r\n// after the primary cluster created \"test-topic-2\" topic, the backup cluster will auto-created the topic: \"primary.test-topic-2\" for us\r\nbackup.kafka().createTopic(\"primary.test-topic-2\", 1); // this line will have race condition with the MM2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: after MM2 replicate the topic, the topic partition number will also get increased to the `NUM_PARTITIONS` in the end. So, we should just let MM2 help us create topic. Also fix 2 issues in the tests:\r\n1. We had resource leak due to no close the adminClient\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

super-high request timeout makes it harder for the producer to gracefully handle unclean connection terminations, which might happen in the case of sudden broker death.\r\n\r\nReducing that value to the default of 30 seconds should address that issue, without compromising the existing delivery guarantees of the Connect framework. Since the delivery timeout is still set to a very-high value, this change shouldn't make it more likely for `Producer::send` to throw an exception and fail the task.\r\n\r\nThis may make duplicate record delivery more likely in cases with extremely-slow broker response time, but that can be addressed by enabling idempotence in the underlying producers for the connector's tasks.\r\n\r\n###

Added SPIs and public classes/interfaces introduced in KIP-405 for tiered storage feature in Kafka.\r\n\r\nKIP-405 introduces tiered storage feature in Kafka. With this feature, Kafka cluster is configured with two tiers of storage - local and remote. The local tier is the same as the current Kafka that uses the local disks on the Kafka brokers to store the log segments. The new remote tier uses systems, such as HDFS or S3 or other cloud storages to store the completed log segments. Consumers fetch the records stored in remote storage through the brokers with the existing protocol.\r\n\r\nWe introduced a few SPIs for plugging in log/index store and remote log metadata store.\r\n\r\nThis involves two parts\r\n1. Storing the actual data in remote storage like HDFS, S3, or other cloud stroages.\r\n2. Storing the metadata about where the remote segments are stored. The default implementation uses an internal Kafka topic.\r\n\r\nYou can read KIP for more details at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage\r\n\r\n###

Instead, we want to discover them through the ApiVersions API. This patch enables the flag to do so. \r\n\r\nIn addition, this patch adds unsupported version as well as authentication version checking to all of the derivatives of `InterBrokerSendThread` which rely on dynamic api version discovery.

Raft-based broker is unable to restart if the broker defers partition metadata changes for a `__consumer_offsets` topic-partition.  The issue is that `GroupMetadataManager` is asked to `removeGroupsForPartition()` upon the broker becoming a follower, but in order for that code to function it requires that the manager's scheduler be started.  There are multiple possible solutions here since `removeGroupsForPartition()` is a no-op at this point in the broker startup cycle (nothing has been loaded, so there is nothing to unload).  We could just not invoke the callback.  But it seems more reasonable to not special-case this and instead start `ReplicaManager` and the coordinators just before applying the deferred partitions states.\r\n\r\nWe also mark deferred partitions for which we are a follower as being online a bit earlier to avoid `NotLeaderOrFollowerException` that was being thrown upon restart.  Fixing this issue exposed the above issue regarding the scheduler not being started.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]
