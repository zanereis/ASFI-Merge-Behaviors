Awaitility and avoid invoking assertThat(Map) for Region (which is a Map).\r\n\r\nThe expiration action is happening asynchronously (from the JUnit main thread). For destroy, the Region is destroyed (which means ops will starting throwing RegionDestroyedException) and then it's removed from the Cache region map (after which it will be null).\r\n\r\nThe test should have theoretically failed with a simpler error message about the Region not being null, but AssertJ treated Region as a Map and attempted to invoke size() which then threw RegionDestroyedException.\r\n\r\nPlease review

the test into two smaller tests, one that tests that a client\r\ndiscovers another locator and another that tests that a client discovers\r\nthat a locator has gone away.\r\n\r\nI did some general updating of the code in this class to\r\n- replace SerializableCallable/Runnables with lambdas\r\n- replace wait-loops with Awaitility\r\n- replace use of AvailablePortHelper with wildcard binds\r\n- replace ignoring of Exceptions with checks for the correct exception class\r\n- replaced heavy use of deprecated methods with their non-deprecated versions\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a
