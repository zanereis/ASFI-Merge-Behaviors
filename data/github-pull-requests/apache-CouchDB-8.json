pull request attempts to fix up many problems that were observed while trying to run the Python-based integration tests for the Mango interface.  Notably:\r\n\r\n- _Tighten integration between the `mango-test` `make` target and the invocation of the Python tests._  Prefer the use `mango-test` over Mango's own way of running the suites.  It does the same things and it is mostly automated already.  Similarly to other kind of tests, introduce the `MANGO_TEST_OPTS` variable for the greater degree of flexibility.  Remove the inconsistent support for external fixture setup and adjust `mango.py` towards working with `dev/run`.\r\n- _Merge Mango integration test suite documentation into the general developer documentation._  Remove redundancy in documentation to make it consistent with other test suites in the code base.\r\n- _Fix Unicode key tests for text indexes._  They were broken due to misconfiguration of source file encoding.  Leverage the same opportunity to update the tests files to assume Python 3 and be treated Unicode text files by default.\r\n- _Mark `$keyMapMatch` tests for text indexes skipped._  Add the missing `skipUnless` annotation for one of the operator tests that does not apply for text indexes.\r\n- _Automate activation of text-index-based test cases._  Propose another approach to activating the tests for text indexes -- instead of the use of the `MANGO_TEXT_INDEXES` environment variable, detect the presence of the `search` feature on the fly and use that as a cue for running the affected tests.\r\n- _Remove test databases by default._ Delete all the databases that were created during the tests to keep the original data store clean.  Introduce the `MANGO_TESTS_KEEP_DBS` environment variable to disable this behavior.\r\n\r\nIn addition that, revamp the general developer documentation by improving on the structure, formatting, revisiting internal and external links, and fixing up various Markdown issues.  The overall goal is to make the Mango integration tests and their associated documentation more usable for developers.\r\n\r\nThings looked like before -- regular case, without `search`:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ make mango-test\r\n[..]\r\n[ * ] Setup environment ... ok\r\n[ * ] Ensure CouchDB is built ... ok\r\n[ * ] Ensure Erlang boot script exists ... ok\r\n[ * ] Prepare

Overview\r\n\r\nNow it is possible to define a JWT roles claim as a comma-seperated list or as a JSON array of strings (the only allowed old behavior).\r\n\r\nIn your JWT token you had to use a JSON array of strings:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"_couchdb.roles\": [\"accounting-role\", \"view-role\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow you can use a comma-seperated list too:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"_couchdb.roles\": \"accounting-role, view-role\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are

are some issues with the Elixir-based tests, for which this pull request proposes solutions:\r\n\r\n- _ExUnit tests has not been adopted and they are not run properly any more._  Translate them (`couch_compress`, `same_site_cookie`) to EUnit and run them as part of the corresponding test suite.  In conjunction with this step, remove the `exunit` target from `check`.\r\n- _Integration tests for Dreyfus are not hooked up._  Create a dedicated `make` target to run the Dreyfus integration tests (`dreyfus-test`) which is not run by default due to the dependency on [Clouseau](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/clouseau).  Hint developers on how to use it, therefore make it a bit more visible.\r\n\r\nFixes #4327\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n% make dreyfus-test\r\n* creating

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n1. `key` behaves as if we set `startkey=$key&endkey=$key`. There is some confusion when we use them together. We should raise a 400 bad request when using `key`, `keys`, `startkey` and `endkey` together.\r\n\r\n**- Previous behavior:**\r\nWhen setting `endkey` to a, it will return doc a. But if we add `key=c`, it will rewrite `startkey` and `endkey` to c, then only doc c will be returned.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -XPUT $DB/db\r\n$ curl -XPOST $DB/db/_bulk_docs -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"docs\": [{\"_id\": \"a\"},{\"_id\": \"b\"},{\"_id\": \"c\"}]}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?endkey=\"a\"'\r\n{\"total_rows\": 3, \"offset\": 0, \"rows\": [\r\n    {\"id\": \"a\",\r\n      \"key\": \"a\",\r\n      \"value\": {\"rev\": \"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\"}\r\n}]}\r\n\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?endkey=\"a\"&key=\"c\"'\r\n{\"total_rows\": 3, \"offset\": 2, \"rows\": [\r\n    {\"id\": \"c\",\r\n      \"key\": \"c\",\r\n      \"value\": {\"rev\": \"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\"}\r\n}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**- After the change:**\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?endkey=\"b\"&key=\"c\"'\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?keys=\\[\"c\"\\]&startkey=\"b\"'\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?key=\"b\"&keys=\\[\"b\"\\]'\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": \"query_parse_error\",\r\n  \"reason\": \"`key`, `keys`, `start_key`, and `end_key` are incompatible\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n2. Add a flag `enable_key_exclusivity` to enable/disable mutual exclusivity for keys\r\n\r\n---\r\n3. Execute a view with reduce function with `key` and single element `keys`, the response is different. We should treat one element `keys` the same as `key` and respond with the same result. If `keys` has multiple elements, it should behave as before.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -XDELETE $DB/db && curl -XPUT $DB/db\r\n$ curl -XPOST $DB/db/_bulk_docs -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d

\"reduce\": \"_sum\"\r\n}}}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**- Previous behavior:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_design/ddoc/_view/map_reduce'?key=\"meatballs\"'\r\n{\"rows\":[{\"key\":null,\"value\":1}]}\r\n\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_design/ddoc/_view/map_reduce'?keys=\\[\"meatballs\"\\]'\r\n{\r\n  \"error\":

change aims to correct the Unix installation instructions in different ways:\r\n\r\n- Note that a too new version of the Erlang OTP can cause build problems.\r\n- On recent macOS systems, the `xcode-select --install` command will install a version of Python 3, along with `pip3`, hence there is no need to do that explicitly.\r\n- Sphinx and the respective theme are installed locally via `venv` for building the documentation, so users should only provide a working Python 3 environment (thanks @nickva for mentioning this).\r\n- Fix markdown of file and command names.\r\n\r\n##

turns out `changes_doc_ids_optimization_threshold` limit has never been applied for the clustered changes feeds. So it was effectively unlimited. This commit enables it, and also adds tests to ensure the limit works.\r\n\r\nSince we didn't have a good Erlang integration test suite for clustered changes feeds, which allowed this case to slip through the cracks, add a few more tests along the way to test the majority of parameter combinations which might interact: sharding single shards vs multiple, continuous vs normal, reverse, row limits etc.\r\n\r\nThe previous limit was 100, but since it was never actually applied it's equivalent not having one at all, so let's pick a new one. I chose 1000 noticing that at Cloudant, close to 3000 we had fabric timeouts on a busy cluster, so that seemed too high. And 1000 seemed about the ballpark of the what size of _bulk_get batch might be. Adding a benchmarking eunit test https://gist.github.com/nickva/a21ef04b7e4bdbed5fdeb708f1d613b5 showed about 50-75 msec to query batches of 1000 random (uuid) doc_ids for Q values 1 through

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve Mango by reducing the data transferred to\r\nthe coordinator during query execution. It may reduce memory or CPU use\r\nat the coordinator but that isn't the primary goal.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when documents are read at the shard level, they are compared\r\nlocally at the shard with the selector to ensure they match before they\r\nare sent to the coordinator. This ensures we're not sending documents\r\nacross the network that the coordinator immediately discards, saving\r\nbandwidth and coordinator processing. This PR further executes field\r\nprojection (`fields` in the query) at the shard level. This should\r\nfurther save bandwidth, particularly for queries that project few fields\r\nfrom large documents.\r\n\r\nOne item of complexity is that a query may request a quorum read of\r\ndocuments, meaning that we need to do the document read at the\r\ncoordinator and not the shard, then perform the `selector` and `fields`\r\nprocessing there rather than at the shard. To ensure that documents are\r\nprocessed consistently whether at the shard or coordinator,\r\nmatch_and_extract_doc/3 is added. There is still one orphan call outside\r\nmatch_and_extract_doc/2 to extract/2 which supports cluster upgrade and\r\nshould later be removed.\r\n\r\nShard level processing is already performed in a callback, view_cb/2,\r\nthat's passed to fabric's view processing to run for each row in the\r\nview result set. It's used for the shard local selector and fields\r\nprocessing. To make it clear what arguments are destined for this\r\ncallback, the PR encapsulates the arguments, using viewcbargs_new/2\r\nand viewcbargs_get/2.\r\n\r\nAs we push down more functionality to the shard, the context this\r\nfunction needs to carry with it will increase, so having a record for it\r\nwill be valuable.\r\n\r\nSupporting cluster upgrades:\r\n\r\nThe PR supports shard pushdown for Mango `fields` processing for\r\nsituations during rolling cluster upgrades. (Cloudant require this\r\nas they use rolling upgrades).\r\n\r\nIn the state where the coordinator is speaking to an upgraded node, the\r\nview_cb/2 needs to support being passed just the `selector` outside of\r\nthe new viewcbargs record. In this case, the shard will not process\r\nfields, but the coordinator will.\r\n\r\nIn the situation where the coordinator is upgraded but the shard is not,\r\nwe need to send the selector to the shard via `selector` and also\r\nexecute the fields projection at the coordinator. Therefore we pass\r\narguments to view_cb/2 via both `selector` and `callback_args` and have\r\nan apparently spurious field projection (mango_fields:extract/2) in the\r\ncode that receives back values from the shard ( factored out into\r\ndoc_member_and_extract).\r\n\r\nBoth of these affordances should only need to exist through one minor\r\nversion change and be removed thereafter -- if people are jumping\r\nseveral minor versions of CouchDB in one go, hopefully they are prepared\r\nfor a bit of trouble.\r\n\r\nTesting upgrade states:\r\n\r\nAs view_cb is completely separate from the rest of the cursor code,\r\nwe can first try out the branch's code using view_cb from `main`, and\r\nthen the other way -- the branch's view_cb with the rest of the file\r\nfrom main. I did both of these tests successfully.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis PR should not change anything from an end user perspective. Mango responses should remain the same as they currently are.\r\n\r\nI have run some basic performance locally tests using k6.io, which showed no meaningful change in the latency of requests.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n  CouchDB build fails at elixir tests initialization when Elixir 1.14 is used.\r\n   Following error stops the build when any Makefile target that depends on `elixir-init` is executed.\r\n```\r\n** (Mix) Invalid arguments given to mix local.rebar: [\"rebar\", \"./bin/rebar\"]. To find out the proper call syntax run \"mix help local.rebar\"\r\n```\r\n Elixir 1.14 removes support for Rebar 2 which produces the error as we are initializing  Rebar 2 and Rebar 3 for test execution. \r\n\r\n This PR removes Rebar 2 initialization from `elixit-init` target enabling support for Elixir 1.14 in the build process. \r\n\r\nWindows build seems not to be affected by the same problem as it is not forcing Rebar 2 initialization, but I have not tested it. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n - Install Elixir 1.14\r\n - Run 'make couch elixir'\r\n\r\n## Related Issues

of having it download its own every time\r\n\r\nAnother step toward being able to run `make check` on the dist output without a network\r\n\r\nThis saves some time and is a bit closer to the goal. \r\n\r\nThe next hurdle is to do the same for hex. Hex it a bit trickier, since we don't have an explicit clone, it just auto-installs itself whenever. During configure we'd have to treat it like rebar3 -- fetch, recompile locally, stash it in `hex/hex.ez`. Then, `make dist` would copy that over to the dist tarball, and during `make check` we'd install it from that archive `mix archive.install ./hex/hex.ez`)\r\n\r\nRelated to:

Overview\r\n\r\nDocumentation was mentioning the exponential backoff on `Crashing` and `Error` states, but did not mention how to configure it. This commit adds note on relation of `max_history` and maximum backoff with link to appropriate configuration section.\r\n\r\nI (hopefully correctly) assumed that `replicator.max_history` affects not only `Crashing` state, but also `Error` state as well.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#4299\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [x] Documentation changes were made in the `src/docs`
