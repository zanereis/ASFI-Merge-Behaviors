Apple Mac OS/X VM get created without USB controller in ESXi hypervisors\n\nProblem Description: CloudStack doesn’t add a USB controller to the Apple Mac OS X VMs created in ESXi hypervisors. But, vSphere Client, by default, adds a USB Controller to the Mac OS VMs. Mac OS X machines require USB Controller for USB mouse and keyboard access.\n\nRoot Cause: The Guest OS details are specified in the Virtual Machine Configuration Spec for creating the VM (using the SDK API) in the EXSi hypervisor. No USB Controller is added to the Virtual Machine Configuration Spec. As the guest OS Identification details are specified in the VM Configuration Spec, It is assumed that the Create VM SDK API would create the defaults in the VM same as vSphere Client. But, as per the observation, USB Controller is not added to the Guest OS - Mac OS VM created through the SDK API.\n\nResolution: When the Guest OS is Apple Mac OS, Add the USB Controller (EHCI+UHCI - Mac supported) to the Virtual Machine Configuration Spec before Creating or Starting the VM. For any existing Mac OS VMs, Stop and Start to add the USB Controller. For new VMs with Mac OS, USB Controller is added

needs to be notifications sent when a host is added to, about to be removed from, and removed from a cluster.\n\nSuch notifications can be used for many purposes. For example, it can allow storage plug-ins to update ACLs on their storage systems. Also, it can allow us to clean up IQNs from ESXi hosts that are no longer

the first part of the refactor, which will touch the ManagedContextRunnable and all its subclasses. However, in order to reduce impact, the first part comprises the Agent and Nio related classes (NioConnection, NioServer and NioClient).\n- All the sub-classes were also updated according to the changes in the super-classes\n- Improved exception handling\n- There were also code formatting changes\n\nChanges were structural and the NioTest covered them without need to modify the unit test.\n\nThis PR is quite extensive.

a management server is halted or rebooted, the cloudstack-management init script does not successfully kill the associated java process. There will always be an error about \"Cannot find PID file\". The script should be reworked so that there are no errors and java is killed correctly.\n\nThis appears to be due to the script using the basename of the script:\n\nNAME=\"$(basename $0)\"\n\nTo look for the pid file:\n\nif [ -f /var/run/$\n{NAME}\n\n.pid ]; then\n\nThis does work correctly if the script is run directly (basename will be \"cloudstack-management\", so \"cloudstack-management.pid\" file is found). However when a server is halted or rebooted, the script is not run directly but via the symlinks in /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/ and /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/, respectively. The symlinks are named \"K20cloudstack-management\" so the script looks for a pid file named \"K20cloudstack-management.pid\" which does not exist.\n\nscreenshots:\n\nBefore fix: \n![screen shot

- Consecutive VM cold migration fails.\n**Root Cause Analysis** - In case of VMware, if VM is being cold migrated between clusters belonging to two different VMware DCs, Cloudstack unregisters the VM from the source host and cleans up the associated VM files. The check if a VM is being cold migrated across DCs is made using the source host id. In case of consecutive cold migrations since the source host id of a VM is NULL and no VM exists, Cloudstack should skip the check\n**Proposed Solution** - Attempt to unregister a VM in another DC, only if there is a host associated with a VM.\n","created_at":"2015-09-10T09:38:01Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T11:15:32Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T11:15:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e27ebd3727b8e6970c78901e0e3f91e82503212c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/f11350f02a0a48ac814f3787895ae4f46843e105","head":{"label":"maneesha-p:pull-21","ref":"pull-21","sha":"f11350f02a0a48ac814f3787895ae4f46843e105","user":{"login":"maneesha-p","id":3909097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDkwOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3909097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p","html_url":"https://github.com/maneesha-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38873841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODg3Mzg0MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"maneesha-p/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maneesha-p","id":3909097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDkwOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3909097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p","html_url":"https://github.com/maneesha-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneesha-p/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maneesha-p/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

Create setup with ZWPS only\n2. set vm.allocation.algorithm to firstfitleastconsumed in global settings\n3. deploy virtual machine\n\nobservation: vm deployment will fail\n\nAfter this fix it will pass\n\nsecond scenario\n1. Create Cloudstack Setup with two hosts (As it needs setup for migration)\n2. Try migrating VM from UI \n\nObservation: There will be error response in logs with nothing available in UI\n\nAfter fix it will pass\n\nRegarding BVT I am not sure whether there exists tests for firstfitleastconsumed vm allocation algorithm.\n","created_at":"2015-09-08T11:44:52Z","updated_at":"2015-11-02T11:09:15Z","closed_at":"2015-11-02T11:09:15Z","merged_at":"2015-11-02T11:09:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"350d2e1e8ff7cf131b53747de1ed8946fad7767b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/a5555ed229de466a0b3834cc8983551cf36fcc53","head":{"label":"anshul1886:CLOUDSTACK-8824-8825","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-8824-8825","sha":"a5555ed229de466a0b3834cc8983551cf36fcc53","user":{"login":"anshul1886","id":1712815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1712815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886","html_url":"https://github.com/anshul1886","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":25956790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTk1Njc5MA==","name":"cloudstack-1","full_name":"anshul1886/cloudstack-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anshul1886","id":1712815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1712815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886","html_url":"https://github.com/anshul1886","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anshul1886/cloudstack-1","description":"Mirror

configure firewall rules, CloudStack modifies `/etc/sysctl.conf` and\nexecute those modifications. This may be harmful for several reasons:\n1. `/etc/sysctl.conf` may be managed by some configuration management\n   system. Such a system will constantly restore the previous version.\n2. `/etc/sysctl.conf` may contain additional properties that have been\n   changed later by some system administrator (for example, once a\n   firewall has been configured, forwarding may have been activated\n   while it is disabled in `/etc/sysctl.conf`). Executing the file\n   again at a later time may disrupt the system.\n3.

to reproduce the problem:\n1. Stop/Destroy the VPC router\n2. Add a virtual machine to one of the VPC tier - it will trigger a VPC router creation\n3. Router is created, but the NICs are not configured\n\nHow to recover without this fix:\n1. Stop/destroy the VPC router and restart the VPC\n\nSide effects: private gateways could be misconfigured.\n\nRoot cause:\n\nIn the VpcNetworkHelperImpl.configureDefaultNics() method, the guest network nic was added in the map prior to the control and public NICs. The order in the map should not matter, however in the LibvirtComputingResource.createVifs() method, there is a logic that relies on the device index - the array index - in order to create the  control nic. I advise a refactor on the data model in order to be able to identify the NIC type instead of relying in the array index.\n\nAn integration test was added to cover the fix:\n- test_vpc_router_nics.py\n\nEnvironment:\nManagement Server running on CentOS 7.1\nKVM host running on CentOS 7.1\nCloudStack Agent/Common 4.6.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nExecuting the test:\n\n```\nnosetests --with-marvin --marvin-config=/data/shared/marvin/mct-zone2-kvm2-ISOLATED.cfg -s -a tags=advanced,required_hardware=true component/test_vpc_router_nics.py\n```\n\nRemark: during the SSH there might be stack traces on the console due to the connection retry. It takes some time to get the PF rules in place and reach the VMs. So, just let the test run until the end.\n\n```\nTest results:\n\nCreate a vpc with two networks with two vms in each network ... === TestName: test_01_VPC_nics_after_destroy | Status : SUCCESS ===\nok\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 1 test in 774.020s\n\nOK\n/tmp//MarvinLogs/test_vpc_router_nics_VH6E9S/results.txt

6a4927f660f776bcbd12ae45f4e63ae2c2e96774 made the HyperV investigator return false instead of null.\n\nReturning false means the VM is NOT running, returning null means \"I don't know\". In 4.4 I experienced corruption because of HyperV returning false, instead of null.\n\nTonight I experienced corruption when one of our management servers went down (out-of-memory, not root caused yet). While all hypervisors that were connected to this management server were connecting the other, HA work started as well with investigators. HyperV happily reported everything as down (while it was still running), causing a mess.\n\nIn 4.5 and master this was already fixed. If you know a better way to fix this, please let me know!\nThis may cause another FindBugs alert, not sure how to resolve that. I just want this out ASAP. Maybe @DaanHoogland @wilderrodrigues or @miguelaferreira can advise on how to fix this properly.\n","created_at":"2015-08-29T22:03:34Z","updated_at":"2015-09-04T20:19:21Z","closed_at":"2015-09-03T15:55:17Z","merged_at":"2015-09-01T11:48:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"8dbe0c233b5ef7f080035d7653fe2272bf43dae9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/03929d24f78c10128aaf788b832edfcf3594004f","head":{"label":"remibergsma:fix-hyperv-returns","ref":"fix-hyperv-returns","sha":"03929d24f78c10128aaf788b832edfcf3594004f","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33662311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzY2MjMxMQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"remibergsma/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

The fix is to use similar\napproach as in projects.js, to use the maximum pagesize of 500.
