SUMMARY\r\nThis PRs optionally adds pod disruption budgets against all Superset deployments. By default, they are not enabled to keep the current behavior but we're now able to set PDBs on any deployment if relevant.\r\n\r\nThis also comes with a slight refactoring on the selector labels for each deployment: they are now defined as named templates in `_helpers.tpl` to mitigate selectors duplication between deployments and their respective related pod disruption budgets.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nOne can set any `supersetXxx.podDisruptionBudget.enabled` as `true` and add either `minAvailable` or `maxUnavailable` variables and test whether the generated manifests look as expected. \r\nPDB manifests are not generated when the relevant `podDisruptionBudget.enabled` is `false` and generation fails if any of the enabled PDB defines both `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable` at the same time.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a potential fix for #17049 which prevents the use of CLI: `superset import-datasources` which appears to have been broken for for some time. Attempting to run `import-datasources` will result in a `NameError: user`.\r\n\r\nLooking at the history of `import-datasources` there used to be a --user which could be applied, but was removed. I saw though that other CLI functions use the following `g.user = security_manager.find_user(username=\"admin\")` to default to the admin user before the `security_manager` runs.\r\n\r\nPlease note, I'm new to Superset, so please help me check on whether using this is acceptable or an insecure workaround.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1) from CLI run: `superset import-datasources -p mydatasources.zip`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Fixes #17049\r\n- [ ] Required feature

[[SIP-99B] Proposal for (re)defining a \"unit of work\"](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25108) I was running into an issue where (I thought) tests were failing due to an issue with the persistence of a logged in user whereas in actuality it was because I was missing the `Public` role.\r\n\r\nThe red herring was due to the slew of tests which don't interface with the test client \"logging\" in a user in the hope of persisting the logged in user to `g.user`. This is ineffectual outside of the client as the Flask globals only persist for the lifetime of the request, i.e., \r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from flask import g\r\n\r\n>>> self.login(username=\"admin\")\r\n>>> print(g.user)\r\n<flask_login.mixins.AnonymousUserMixin object at 0x160c48be0>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFlask-Login automatically restores `g.user` from that cookie if it is not in the session when dealing with requests from the client. The TL;DR is authenticating (logging in/logging out) the user is only effectual in the context of web requests via the client.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes any erroneous logins (and logouts)—determined by first eliminating all references and re-adding them for API related tests. It also cleans up any inconsistencies in how logging in occurs. I updated the `login()` method to remove the default `admin` username so now it's a required argument which aids with readability.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip

SUMMARY\nSpeaking with the devexp committee, and in the recent community hall\nmeeting, it's pretty clear we don't need to build the whole docker\nmatrix on every PR event. It's somewhat expensive and isn't useful.\n\nOne of the reason we did it, from what I've gathered, is we want to\ncatch if some change breaks the docker build for whatever reason. Now\nwe may not need to actively prevent this pre-merge as this is unlikely,\nyet we can still catch it on `master` as I'm keeping the push events on\nmaster.\n\nNote that:\n- I'm also moving the master push build to be multi-platform (amd+arm)\n  as we started doing this for the release builds, which is nice as\n  the same image can be used on different archs\n- The PR events were not \"pushed\" or cached in our shared, remote\n  dockerhub-hosted repo anyways, they were just kind of dry-runs\n\nOh one more thing, notice the no-op.yml changes? That's because the\nrequired checks related to branch protection are always based on what's\ndefined on .asf.yml ON `master`, meaning i need to add dummy/no-op\nchecks to get this merged, and those can be cleaned up later on in a\nfollow up PR.

SUMMARY\r\nPreviously we used to build the time range for time comparison in the frontend, this logic was duplicating what the backend already handles for us, so we are moving away from origin implementation and instead leverage the existing APIs that build queryObjects to handle time_shift.\r\n\r\nAlso, In order to DRY time comparison logic when implementing the logic into other viz plugins, we are extracting out the code that was before part of BigNumbers with time comparison plugin.\r\n\r\nThe new BigNumber with Time Comparison viz had no tests, so this PR is also including some for the new utils and changes made.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe BigNumber with Time

show expected behaviour after the change.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24889\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n\r\nWhen chart data is forced to refresh in chart view, query is executed in synchronous manner, even when GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES=True.\r\n\r\nExpected results\r\nSuperset should:\r\n1. Request chart data (POST /api/v1/chart/data?form_data=<fomr_data>)\r\n2. Poll for results (GET /api/v1/async_event/?last_id=<last_id>)\r\n3. Get results (GET /api/v1/chart/data/<cache_key>)\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nSuperset sends POST /api/v1/chart/data and waits for that request to return results.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1136\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-23 at 13 26 05\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/62499342/01eef591-40ec-4881-92d4-abd0721b6f89\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1375\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-23 at 13 28 51\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/62499342/0b598c75-f525-48df-903a-bb99d2c0858a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFixes #25327.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the selected number format gets applied to all lines of the box plot tooltip. For example, if you are displaying durations (number format \"Duration in ms\") and you have 3544 observations, the tooltip will say \"# Observations: 3.5s\".\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the formatting for values which are by definition without unit, i.e. \"# Observations\" and \"# Outliers\".\r\n\r\nI am aware that it would be better to skip the formatting based on the selected format, because formats like \",d\" and \".1s\" can still be applied. I would argue though that no formatting still beats the current wrong formatting.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/102797966/fc22b12e-79a5-47c7-8041-73367e26a303)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/102797966/0d9ac74d-02c0-475d-853d-7d51db2e4462)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

instances within our tests where we explicitly expunge either specific or all objects from the session, however this is unnecessary as the Flask-SQLAlchemy session is torn down after each test (verified via logging) in which the [current session is removed/closed](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-sqlalchemy/blob/42a36a3cb604fd39d81d00b54ab3988bbd0ad184/src/flask_sqlalchemy/extension.py#L448) and thus there's no need to explicitly expunge the records.\r\n\r\nNote this change is a precursor to defining a \"unit of work\" as part of [SIP-99B](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25108). I've been struggling to get the various unit/integration tests to pass in my PoC—in part due to atypical testing patterns.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where toast messages were duplicated. This happened because the initialization of flash messages (emitted from server-side) was being made both by `FlashProvider` and during the initialization of SQL Lab state. This PR makes `FlashProvider` solely responsible for initializing flash messages.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1774\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 16 42 38\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAt Preset we use [`snowflake-connector-python`](https://pypi.org/project/snowflake-connector-python/) and the highest version doesn't support `cryptography==42.0.0` which we bumped in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27113) . Because of that, we'd need the minimum decreased back to `41.0.2` until it is supported in `snowflake-connector-python`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhile working on the docker build matrix, I noticed there were opportunities to improve cache hit rate on docker builds, here are some of the ideas, explained inline with the PR\r\n\r\nOne thing that's getting improved here is around the fact that the python dependencies (`pip install`) are getting re-triggered when `package.json` changes, simply because we use it as the source of truth for both npm and python (setup.py used to read the package.json to figure out which version it is). Here I extract the version in a file instead of COPY package.json\r\n\r\nOther notable changes:\r\n- removed `requirements/development.*` from the `lean` docker target, clearly lean shouldn't have a bunch development-related libraries. This may be a breaking change for some. mostly [postgres] being in there, and maybe druid and hive. We *may* want to promote postgres to lean, but unclear... maybe [cors] ?\r\n- removed `requirements/local.*` that had become a pointer to `requirements/development.*`\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-15T06:35:02Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T06:37:46Z","closed_at":"2024-03-12T21:19:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"854c0346ccf623655fb6ddefe4ec822a00ff5ae0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/27122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/27122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/27122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/cf2741ca7316a0783d1d4bd1b7eb2e3f701610a1","head":{"label":"apache:faster_docker","ref":"faster_docker","sha":"cf2741ca7316a0783d1d4bd1b7eb2e3f701610a1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39464018,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQ2NDAxOA==","name":"superset","full_name":"apache/superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset","description":"Apache

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt _really pains_ me that local and remote CI testing is quite different which results in numerous wasted cycles. A case in point is for major refactors I often run tests locally (which are invoked via `tox`), however when running the following (as part of another PR), \r\n\r\n```\r\n tox -e py39 -- tests/unit_tests/security/manager_test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe test would fail—due to a UNIQUE constraint violation—as the unit tests expect that the database schema/records are not defined, though the `tox` `testenv` environment runs the following commands prior to invoking `pytest`,\r\n\r\n```\r\nsuperset db upgrade\r\nsuperset init\r\n```\r\n\r\nand thus one cannot [redefine](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/tests/unit_tests/security/manager_test.py#L247-L263) the `Alpha` role.  Personally—per a line item I've added to the monthly Superset Meetup—I think we shouldn't differentiate between unit and integration tests and ensure that any setup works for any and all tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply ensures that all Python tests (be that local or remote) are invoked via the `python_tests.sh` script. This should work under the condition that you're running either the unit tests or integration tests, but not both.\r\n\r\nFinally I've moved the loading of test users to leverage the `load-test-users` CLI command. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nOk, so we're working toward solidifying/stabilizing translation efforts. Here's another step in the chain, where we:\r\n\r\n* Remove `.json` translation files from the repo and add them to `.gitignore`\r\n* Tweak the `.json` building script so it can be run from a new `npm run build-translations` script\r\n* Build those translations whenever doing `npm run build` or `build-instrumented`\r\n* Remove translation code owners - they shouldn't be needed now that people won't likely edit the `.json` files.\r\n* Removes two `npm` scripts for linting translations. From here on out, you just get what you get, and it'll work :)\r\n* Removing translation lint check on CI, as that's no longer relevant.\r\n\r\nNext steps/PRs:\r\n* add a CI task that updates the `.pot` file and `.po` files on any PR that touches `.py` or `.(j|t)s(x)` files. \r\n* build the translation files on docker builds\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe API of filter_state is already exposed but it doesn't look like other APIs. We had a problem gaining 403 Status Code when addressing this endpoint. It was because of the lack of role permissions but there were no messages in the logs. Introducing these decorators we add recording the problem to the log so it will be easier to investigate the problem.\r\n\r\n#### Comment\r\nThis is a copy of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23282 because I've lost access to the company's repository and they are not working intensively on Superset now.","created_at":"2024-02-12T16:50:02Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T16:24:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c129ef042bacc8179169647417d6d9e4d40ac861","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"michael-s-molina","id":70410625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDEwNjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70410625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-s-molina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2859155980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODU5MTU1OTgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/api","name":"api","color":"91C99C","default":false,"description":"Related

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently ongoing ephemeral env builds can be canceled by new comments on a PR. Although the build is re-triggered again this can cause confusion and certainly delays on spinning up new ephemeral environments.\r\n\r\nThis is probably caused by the global concurrency group, splitting this group between comments and build should fix this issue.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's hard to test this at the PR level since this workflow code will always use the latest commit on the default branch \r\n\r\n<br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Run Drill on docker:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run -it --name drill -p 8047:8047 -p 31010:31010 apache/drill\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Go to http://localhost:8047/storage and enable the RDBMS storage.\r\n3. Update the storage and point it to the `examples` database in Postgres:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"jdbc\",\r\n  \"driver\": \"org.postgresql.Driver\",\r\n  \"url\": \"jdbc:postgresql://host.docker.internal:5432/examples\",\r\n  \"username\": \"beto\",\r\n  \"sourceParameters\": {\r\n    \"keepaliveTime\": 0,\r\n    \"minimumIdle\": 0,\r\n    \"idleTimeout\": 3600000,\r\n    \"maximumPoolSize\": 10,\r\n    \"maxLifetime\": 21600000\r\n  },\r\n  \"authMode\": \"SHARED_USER\",\r\n  \"writerBatchSize\": 10000,\r\n  \"enabled\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Install the Postgres JDBC driver inside the container:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker exec -it -u root drill bash\r\ncd /opt/drill/jars/3rdparty/\r\nwget https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-42.7.1.jar\r\nexit\r\ndocker restart drill\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Connect Superset to Drill using: `drill+sadrill://localhost:8047/cp?use_ssl=False`\r\n6. Query the `bart_lines` from Superset (this assumes that the Postgres storage is called `rdbms`):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM rdbms.bart_lines\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Delete all rows from the `bart_lines` table — you can do this in Postgres directly, and you should be able to do it from Superset if you've enabled DML in the Drill database.\r\n8. Run the query again. It should show:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-02-09 at 15-59-35 Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/5647cfea-5f37-406a-9ebe-677cc62c2d24)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

Interactive plots will not work.')\r\n```\r\n\r\n(It does something similar for `matplotlib`.)\r\n\r\nThese calls to `logger.error` will pollute and trigger unnecessary alerts.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a decorator `suppress_logging` that can be used in cases like this to suppress the logging:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith suppress_logging(\"prophet.plot\"):\r\n    from prophet import Prophet\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhile GitHub actions are powerful, it's been hard to work with actions as they hard to develop, test, and debug.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a new `supsersetbot` utility bot that can be used to help around GitHub, CI and beyond. For now it does some basic things like labeling PRs and issues, but the idea is to grow it to serve set of utility functions to help around GitHub, GitHub actions, CI, release management and the repo int general. Things like managing ephemeral environments, supporting release management.\r\n\r\nBecause it's a proper npm app, it can be tested, versioned, deployed and used locally.\r\n\r\nIt's a CLI as in:\r\n```\r\n$ supersetbot\r\nUsage: supersetbot [options] [command]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -r, --repo <repo>          The GitHub repo to use (ie: \"apache/superset\") (default: \"mistercrunch/superset\")\r\n  -a, --actor <actor>        The actor (default: \"bob\")\r\n  -h, --help                 display help for command\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\n  label [options] <label>    Add a label to an issue or PR\r\n  unlabel [options] <label>  Remove a label from an issue or PR\r\n  orglabel [options]         Add an org label based on the author\r\n  help [command]             display help for command\r\n```\r\nBut it can also be called from GitHub comments, as in:\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 3 17 15 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/487433/0a5bc853-f3ae-47ca-bb3b-531c540b329b\">\r\n\r\nThis means that PR comments can be used a bit more like a terminal, and committers and users can trigger things. Note that it's fully context-aware, nows whether the commenter is a committer, and can decide who should be able to do what.\r\n\r\nWhile this first version brings back the funcitonality we had with a previous, hosted now defunct `supersetbot`, the vision is to extend it to manage ephemeral envs, tag PRs with release-related information,

1: Replicate Superset Frontend Login To Generate Dynamic Forms\r\n  To connect to external API resources\r\nTask 2: Adding Custom Icons to Database Form\r\n  To enhance user interface of the database connection form by adding custom icons for MySQL databases\r\n\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIssues install superset, stuck on welcome page after logging in to Apache Superset and frontend could not be fully build due to npm ci command taking a very long time with no final output. The below includes instructions as well as steps would have been taken if these issues were not present.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTask 1: \r\n-Installed the database driver for rockset api: pip install rockset-sqlalchemy \r\n- login to apache superset \r\n- click database \r\n- click supported databases, then click other \r\n- in the SQLALCHEMY URI section, enter the connection string for rockset:\r\nrockset://{slzXRHem1lebeo13tDp9LqaeItDIJ201GWOhjcrbWelAQTxmHntftKWfntmvfwS5}:@{api.use1a1.rockset.com}\r\n- Use this as guide for other connection string formats for other APIs: https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers/\r\n- click test connection, then connect\r\n\r\nTask 2:\r\n- Added a link to the MySQL image in the superset_text.yml file : mysql.jpg\r\n- superset/superset/config.py contained a section referring to the 'preferred_databases'. MySQL already mentioned in that part so no need to add it in\r\n-go to database page, then to Connect a Database form\r\n- enter parameters such as: localhost, host, database name\r\n-click connect \r\n-restart (run dev-server)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x]

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen we create a time-series chart with a quarter time grain, the default formatting sometimes displays the year (YYYY) at the beginning of the year, such as '2023', while the remaining quarters display the first month of the quarter, such as 'Apr' or 'Jul'. This inconsistency in formatting can make the chart less readable and less consistent. To address this issue, I've made changes to adjust the default formatting. \r\nI'm not sure whether this solution is overly hard-coded or if there are more effective alternatives available. Please help suggest!\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n**Before:**\r\n![Screenshot 2567-02-07 at 17 18 00](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/6b2649dc-5dd4-4ff1-b9e1-45d75ae06753)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/ebfa5e19-a26c-4b11-ae09-abb9a764883d)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduced a new permission to enable view and drilling actions on the Dashboard independently of the `can_explore` permission #26798. However, from recent feedback it is clear that the need is to have more granularity for these permissions.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the following permissions:\r\n\r\n- `can_view_chart_as_table` to enable the \"View as table\" option in the chart actions in a Dashboard\r\n- `can_view_query` to enable the \"View query\" option in the chart actions in a Dashboard\r\n\r\nThis PR also implements the following changes:\r\n- It removes the permission `can_view_and_drill` introduced in #26798.\r\n- It ties Drill to detail to both `can_explore` and `can_samples` as `can_samples` is a required backend permission for Drill to detail to work\r\n- It ties Drill by  to both `can_explore` and `can_write_ExploreFormDataRestAPI` as the latter is a required backend permissions for the submission of form data when interacting with Drill by\r\n\r\nFixes #26762 \r\nFixes #25630\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- [ ] CI should pass\r\n- [ ] A role with `can_view_chart_as_table` should see the View as table option without can_explore permission\r\n- [ ] A role with `can_view_query` should see the View query option without can_explore permission\r\n- [ ] A role without `can_samples` should not be able to see Drill to detail\r\n- [ ] A role without `can_write_ExploreFormDataRestAPI` should not see Drill by\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nReplace the SelectControl component with an AsyncSelect component when choosing the source of the annotation. This addresses the response limiting table options to 100 max. There are relevant changes to the process of fetching and where the fetch is being made in the file.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBEFORE:\r\n![limited-charts](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/92495987/f5aeaebc-8690-4fc0-9d55-9372c7869407)\r\nAFTER:\r\n![all-charts](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/92495987/75d5bca9-984f-4b2e-92fa-3b3f7093131f)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Create 100+ annotations or Tables. Saving dashboards as duplicates and selecting the duplicate charts box will speed this process up.\r\n- Charts must be **created by you** (annotation options are filtered by `'chart_owned_created_favored_by_me'`)\r\n- Create a new chart\r\n- Click the \"Add Annotation\" button\r\n- Choose an Annotation type requiring a query, e.g. \"Event\"\r\n- Scroll through the options to verify display of all 100+ charts\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Fixes #25421 \r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\nThe `DASHBOARD_RBAC` FF allows Organizations to manage dashboard access through roles (instead of managing via dataset access). According to the documentation and [recent PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23586), in case the dashboard has no roles associated with it, the regular dataset validation should happen.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the security logic so that draft dashboard metadata isn't leaked. This was the previous logic:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nif is_feature_enabled(\"DASHBOARD_RBAC\") and dashboard.roles:\r\n    if dashboard.published and {role.id for role in dashboard.roles} & {\r\n        role.id for role in self.get_user_roles()\r\n    }:\r\n        return\r\nelif (\r\n    not dashboard.published\r\n    or not dashboard.datasources\r\n    or any(\r\n        self.can_access_datasource(datasource)\r\n        for datasource in dashboard.datasources\r\n    )\r\n):\r\n    return\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `not dashboard.published` condition was leaking metadata for any draft dashboard to all users (regardless of the FF state). The actual chart data was not exposed due to dataset validation.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard in draft state.\r\n2. Access Superset with a user from a role that doesn't have access to the dashboard (either via `DASHBOARD_RBAC` or regular RBAC).\r\n3. Access the dashboard URL.\r\n\r\nThe dashboard shouldn't load.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-05T17:29:41Z","updated_at":"2024-07-02T20:44:23Z","closed_at":"2024-02-07T16:20:42Z","merged_at":"2024-02-07T16:20:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"01e2f8ace31950ca337a6a8d7348d37c59cf8126","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5111009119,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABMKPPXw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v3.0","name":"v3.0","color":"0070C9","default":false,"description":"Label
