https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33923\r\n\r\nPretty self explanatory, since python's zero is falsey, using `{% if form.details.value %}` led to the default value being omitted if it was a zero. This minor change makes a zero default value explicitly zero, and if a user wants to default to null they can use something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nParam(None, type=[\"integer\", \"null\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo given the following DAG:\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    \"params-dag\",\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    params={\r\n        \"integer_param\": Param(5, type=\"integer\"),\r\n        \"zero_integer_param\": Param(0, type=\"integer\"),\r\n        \"unset_integer_param\": Param(None, type=[\"integer\", \"null\"]),\r\n    },\r\n) as dag:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was the default form before:\r\n<img width=\"1875\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/16950874/741e86f1-58db-47e9-99a0-f8c2f1516271\">\r\n\r\nAnd this is it after:\r\n<img width=\"1892\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/16950874/ce4fa7d9-e5c5-4a00-b293-b438b7da2784\">\r\n\r\nList-type params are a whole different problem, and there's a lot of discussion in the original issue, so lets leave that for another PR? In the current implementation there's no way to explicitly pass an empty list through the form interface so I think that some changes will be definitely be required.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-31T17:06:15Z","updated_at":"2023-09-01T15:06:45Z","closed_at":"2023-08-31T20:54:54Z","merged_at":"2023-08-31T20:54:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"c51901afc14bf82ff678226a7b8e32a972eff924","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Thus after serialization in the Trigerrer the default value for the `aws_conn_id` is used (which is `aws_default`).\r\nSee the example log in the bottom (Airflow there doesn't have the `aws_default` connection configured). Note that before deferral it uses the `aws` connection, but afterwards switches to `aws_default.`\r\n\r\n**Scope**\r\nThis PR \r\n1. fixes the EmrHook initialization in the EmrStepSensorTrigger\r\n2. extends the emr triggers serialization test to check the hooks' `aws_conn_id` value\r\n3. and makes aws_conn_id assignment explicit for hook initialization in the EmrContainerTrigger to avoid the same problem in case of implementation changes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:27 UTC] {task_command.py:415} INFO - Running <TaskInstance: dagname.wait_emr_step scheduled__2023-01-01 00:00:00+00:00 [running]> on host INSTANCE_01\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:27 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1660} INFO - Exporting env vars: AIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_EMAIL='example@mail.com' AIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_OWNER='airflow' AIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_ID='dagname' AIRFLOW_CTX_TASK_ID='wait_emr_step' AIRFLOW_CTX_EXECUTION_DATE='2023-01-01T00:00:00' AIRFLOW_CTX_TRY_NUMBER='2' AIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_RUN_ID='scheduled__2023-01-01 00:00:00+00:00'\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:27 UTC] {base.py:73} INFO - Using connection ID 'aws' for task execution.\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:27 UTC] {emr.py:575} INFO - Poking step s-STEPID on cluster j-CLUSTERID\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:28 UTC] {emr.py:79} INFO - Job flow currently PENDING\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:28 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1526} INFO - Pausing task as DEFERRED. dag_id=dagname, task_id=wait_emr_step, execution_date=20230101T000000, start_date=20230101T000000\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:28 UTC] {local_task_job_runner.py:225} INFO - Task exited with return code 100 (task deferral)\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:28 UTC] {base_aws.py:566} WARNING - Unable to find AWS Connection ID 'aws_default', switching to empty.\r\n[2023-01-01, 13:52:28 UTC] {base_aws.py:160} INFO - No connection ID provided.

`devel_only` extra puts together all dependencies that are needed for CI image and in order to run tests in local virtualenv for various test cases of ours - but they are not needed as dependencies of particular providers. They were a little \"bag of everything\" and they were hiding some unused dependencies or dependencies that were either unused or they were actually provider dependencies already.\r\n\r\nFor example we had qds-sdk dependency there which was really the qubole provider dependency and it held us back from removing deprecated boto library from CI image (removed in #33889).\r\n\r\nThis PR organizes the dependency a bit better:\r\n\r\n* split it to logical groups\r\n* removes some unused dependencies\r\n* moves \"amazon\" mypy dependency from providers to here\r\n\r\nAt later stage we will move the provider ones into \"[devel]\" extras of the providers as part of provider decooupling, but this will require a bit more changes in CI image building and some documentation update for developers. This is an intermediate step to organize it better.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33850\r\nazure-storage-file has not been updated since August 2019 and it is now outdated. \r\n\r\nAzureFileShareHook is getting just in one operator AzureFileShareToGCSOperator, that too only `list_files` and `get_file_to_stream` methods so little risk if we release some breaking changes.\r\nThe new azure-storage-file-share provides a more elegant way to call Azure API. Also, it allows to use features like a TokenCredential.\r\n\r\nSince the update on the Azure SDK side is huge making it fully backward-compatible is a bit difficult and may not be possible \r\n\r\nIn the Airflow repo, we consider hook as a public interface/API so we might not like to do a direct breaking change release in that case I'll like to propose adding deprecation warring in the existing method and the param here is a WIP PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33905 and then in the subsequent release, we can remove the deprecated one and use release this PR and also we will expose only whose method from Azure file share hook which is getting used in Airflow codebase.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

this doesn't change existing trigger rule but does extract the inner functions into methods. For ease of review i have done this part in the first commit, separate from the introduction of setup constraint.\r\n\r\nAlternative to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33570\r\n\r\nThis is yet another approach to solving this one.  But I feel it's the best one thus far because it does not make any changes to existing trigger rule logic, apart from pulling out some internal functions into methods.\r\n\r\nThe indirect setup constraint logic is processed prior to trigger rules and is completely separate.\r\n\r\nThis _should_ play nicely with all mapping scenarios but more testing is required to verify.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple choices to make here.\r\n\r\nOne is in the \"setup constraint\" logic, should we apply it only to indirect setups or to all relevant setups?  I think the only time it makes a difference is when it there is a mixture of skipped and failed upstream setups and how we determine state of the object task.\r\n\r\nCurrently I only look at indirect setups.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is, for calculation of state, do we just go based on the state of the first non-succcess?  Or should we wait until everything is done and calculate at that point?  Currently it just takes the first non-success and fails (or skips) fast.  And I think this is consistent with airflow's many-to-one behavior more generally.\r\n\r\nNote: for easier review, the first commit is a no-behavior-change refactor that just pulls the inner funcions out into methods.  The second commit is where the setup constraint logic is added.\r\n\r\nHere is an example dag that can be used to test the behavior:\r\n[Uploading setup_teardown_bug.txt…]()\r\n\r\nThe way to use that dag is to first change all the \"scenarios\" to `[\"success\", \"success\", \"success\"]` and then you'll get a clean run.\r\nThen you change the scenario e.g. to `[\"skip\", \"fail\", \"succes\"]`.  Then, you clear the task with indirect upstream setup and see what happens.  The first mapped setup will skip, 5 seconds later the next fails, then 5 seconds later there's a success.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-30T00:31:11Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T09:58:58Z","closed_at":"2023-09-03T15:48:51Z","merged_at":"2023-09-03T15:48:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"e75cecab72bd59ae9fa04631bdc7a27a745d61fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type

is new functionality that is optional.  In our k8s deployments, the postgres and redis password secrets are initialized in an init container.  After this, the corresponding url secrets need to have the passwords.  Replacing the postgres and redis url secrets so they have the password is not simple.  Therefore, this change will have airflow look for BROKER_URL_PASSWORD.  If it is set, the BROKER_URL will have the password replaced.  Similarly, if SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_PASSWORD is set, the SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN url will have the password replaced.\r\n\r\nImplementation note:  I found code in airflow/cli/commands/info_command.py that is used to replace the password in url's with the word \"PASSWORD\".  This is done to anonymize the url for logging.  I moved that code into a function so it can be reused.  I put the function in airflow/utils/net.py.  Let me know if a different place makes sense or if it should be in its own file.\r\n\r\nCommit message:\r\n\r\nFor BROKER_URL and SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN, allow optional BROKER_URL_PASSWORD and SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_PASSWORD.  If set, replace the password in BROKER_URL/SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN with password values.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

the diff is big because I re-unified the various FAB security managers in one class. See https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33901#issuecomment-1699621243\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is currently a weird situation with the security managers, where the `AirflowSecurityManager`, which is supposed to be the more generic construct, inherits from `FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride`, supposed to be the more specific one. Because of this, `FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride` doesn't bear well its name, because it cannot override anything from `AirflowSecurityManager` since it sits lower on the inheritance tree.\r\n\r\nThis was done initially to be able to _extend_ functionalities of the Security Manager, while retaining an existing feature which was that users could plug their own security manager inheriting from `AirflowSecurityManager` (so we couldn't squeeze the FAB one in between because that'd be a breaking change).\r\n\r\nThe solution I used here is to have an empty shell stay where the `AirflowSecurityManager` was, just to maintain back-compatibility. That one inherits from FAB Security Manager, which can now sit below the actual `AirflowSecurityManager`.\r\n\r\nThis means that users can only override the FAB security manager and not other auth provider's SM but that's ok because this feature is pretty much rendered obsolete by AIP-56.

the `QUEUED` state as a non_terminal state for the operator, hence triggering the usual defer behavior.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

PR aims to prevent a misuse of _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS by mistakes that our users often make without realising the consequences.\r\n\r\n1) The _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS should only be used for quick\r\n   iterations and testing, they should never be used in anything\r\n   resembling production environment. This PR will give maximum\r\n   10 minutes of life for a container that has the environment\r\n   variable set. Should be enough for testing but unusable for\r\n   production.\r\n\r\n2) When installing the _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS we additionally\r\n   install airflow version corresponding to the airflow version\r\n   already installed in the image. This prevents accidental\r\n   downgrades or upgrades of airflow by installing dependencies that\r\n   are not compatible with given airflow version\r\n\r\n3) After installing the depdencies with _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS\r\n   we run `pip check` to make sure that newly installed requirements\r\n   are not in conflict with some other requirements installed earlier.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

tried to address #31720 in PR #31757. The issue talked \r\nabout adding a trigger cancelled log when trigger times out,\r\n but we also added a generic Trigger canceled log. This log \r\nappears even in successful runs of the triggers when they \r\nfinish. This is confusing some users as the log level is Error \r\nand there are sometimes quite a few log lines saying \r\n\"Trigger cancelled; message=\" with giving no clue as to what is \r\nhappening. So, I am removing this generic error log line and \r\nwe can later add specific cancel scenarios with detailed \r\nreasons when we implement those.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

was an edge case with race condition between merging the setup.py change to main and refreshing constraint causing a failure of PROD image building when the new setup.py had conflicting dependencies with the past constraints. This happened on Aug 28 with azure-mgmt-containerinstance which got upgrade to a new 8.0.0 version which was conflicting with previous setup.py:\r\n\r\n* azure-mgmt-containerinstance>=1.5.0,<2.0\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n* azure-mgmt-containerinstance>=7.0.0,<9.0.0\r\n\r\nThe problem was that PROD builds used the constraints from main to build the image, because constraints were not produced in the CI builds for the same job (constraints wer only produced in the PR that had \"upgrade to newer depedencies\".\r\n\r\nThe regular PR CI builds have a build-in protection against such edge case - they run with `--upgrade-on-failure` flag that causes the PRs to upgrade their constraints eagerly if they fail on constraints failure.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the edge case by utilising the result of the flag --upgrade-on failure.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, constraints will always be uploaded by CI jobs, not only when \"upgrade to newer dependencies\" PR is run. this means that when CI build falls back as result of `--upgrade-on-failure` the newly generated constraints are uploaded as artifacts and used by PROD image build.\r\n\r\nAs a side-effect, every PR will produce the constraints used by that build as artifact. This is actually pretty good thing for diagnosis of dependency problems.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
