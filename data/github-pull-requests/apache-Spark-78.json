What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nit seems that `run_python_packaging_tests` requires some disk space and cause some pyspark modules fail, this PR is to make

module)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/7322292/2d37c141-15b8-4d9f-bfbd-4dd7782ab62e)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1, it seems it is the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- The pr aims to upgrade RoaringBitmap from 0.9.45 to 1.0.0.\r\n- From version 1.0.0, the `ArraysShim` class has been moved from `shims-x.x.x.jar` jar to `RoaringBitmap-x.x.x.jar` jar, so we no longer need to rely on it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The newest brings some improvments, eg:\r\nAdd zero-garbage deserialiser for ByteBuffer to RoaringBitmap by @shikharid in https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/650\r\nMore specialized method for value decrementation by @xtonik in https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/640\r\nDuplicated small array sort routine by @xtonik in https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/638\r\nAvoid intermediate byte array creation by @xtonik in https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/635\r\nUseless back and forth BD bytes conversion by @xtonik in https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/636\r\n\r\n- The full release

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade sbt from 1.9.2 to 1.9.3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.The new version brings some improvment:\r\nActionable diagnostics (aka quickfix)\r\nActionable diagnostics, or quickfix, is an area in Scala tooling that's been getting attention since Chris Kipp presented it in the March 2023 Tooling Summit. Chris has written the [roadmap](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/roadmap-for-actionable-diagnostics/6172/1) and sent https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/7242 that kickstarted the effort, but now there's been steady progress in https://github.com/build-server-protocol/build-server-protocol/pull/527, https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/17337, https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10406/, IntelliJ, Zinc, etc. Metals 1.0.0, for example, is now capable of surfacing code actions as a quickfix.\r\nsbt 1.9.3 adds a new interface called AnalysisCallback2 to relay code actions from the compiler(s) to Zinc's Analysis file. Future version of Scala 2.13.x (and hopefully Scala 3) will release with proper code actions, but as a demo I've implemented a code action for procedure syntax usages even on current Scala 2.13.11 with -deprecation flag.\r\n\r\n2.Full release notes:\r\nhttps://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.3\r\n\r\n3.v1.9.2 VS v1.9.3\r\nhttps://github.com/sbt/sbt/compare/v1.9.2...v1.9.3\r\n\r\n### Does

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `BitmapCount` and `BitmapOrAgg` to use `DataTypeMismatch` rather than `TypeCheckResult.TypeCheckFailure` to indicate incorrect input types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt appears `TypeCheckResult.TypeCheckFailure` has been deprecated: No expressions except for the recently added `BitmapCount` and `BitmapOrAgg` are using it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes an error message for two expressions that are not yet in any released version of Spark.\r\n\r\nBefore

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor push based shuffle metrics, when writting out the event to log file, the field name is [\"Push Based Shuffle\"](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/JsonProtocol.scala#L548).\r\nBut when parsing it out in SHS, the expected field name is [\"Shuffle Push Read Metrics\"](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/JsonProtocol.scala#L1264). This mismatch makes all the push shuffle metrics 0 from SHS rest calls. This PR changes all the reference to \"Push Based Shuffle\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, all the push shuffle metrics will not be rendered correctly through SHS rest calls.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLaunched Spark-shell application in Yarn client mode in our cluster, get the log file to local, and started a local Spark History Server to parse the log file. The metrics are shown correctly after this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds support for `accumulator`, `broadcast` in vanilla PySpark, and Spark files in both vanilla PySpark and Spark Connect Python client, in Python UDTF's analyze.\r\n\r\nFor example, in vanilla PySpark:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> colname = sc.broadcast(\"col1\")\r\n>>> test_accum = sc.accumulator(0)\r\n\r\n>>> @udtf\r\n... class TestUDTF:\r\n...     @staticmethod\r\n...     def analyze(a: AnalyzeArgument) -> AnalyzeResult:\r\n...         test_accum.add(1)\r\n...         return AnalyzeResult(StructType().add(colname.value, a.data_type))\r\n...     def eval(self, a):\r\n...         test_accum.add(1)\r\n...         yield a,\r\n...\r\n>>> df = TestUDTF(lit(10))\r\n>>> df.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- col1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+----+\r\n|col1|\r\n+----+\r\n|  10|\r\n+----+\r\n\r\n>>> test_accum.value\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> pyfile_path = \"my_pyfile.py\"\r\n>>> with open(pyfile_path, \"w\") as f:\r\n...     f.write(\"my_func = lambda: 'col1'\")\r\n...\r\n24\r\n>>> sc.addPyFile(pyfile_path)\r\n>>> # or spark.addArtifacts(pyfile_path, pyfile=True)\r\n>>>\r\n>>> @udtf\r\n... class TestUDTF:\r\n...     @staticmethod\r\n...     def analyze(a: AnalyzeArgument) -> AnalyzeResult:\r\n...         import my_pyfile\r\n...         return AnalyzeResult(StructType().add(my_pyfile.my_func(), a.data_type))\r\n...     def eval(self, a):\r\n...         yield a,\r\n...\r\n>>> df = TestUDTF(lit(10))\r\n>>> df.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- col1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+----+\r\n|col1|\r\n+----+\r\n|  10|\r\n+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support missing features: `accumulator`, `broadcast`, and Spark files in Python UDTF's analyze.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, accumulator, broadcast in vanilla PySpark, and Spark files in both vanilla PySpark and Spark Connect Python client will be available.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded related

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR moves `AnalysisException` to sql/api. In order to do so we had to move the `plan` field out. We have introduced the `ExtendedAnalysisException` subclass to host this field.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `AnalysisException` does not have the `plan` field anymore. This is a breaking change. On the upside this reduces a lot of the breaking changes we had to make, for example `ParseException` is an `AnalysisException` again.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n(Updated) Existing

What Changes Were Proposed \r\nThis PR adds some end to end tests for the DeepspeedTorchDistributor. Due to the lack of support currently available to deepspeed, we use proxy functions that are very simple to test that the command works. For the future, once Deepspeed supports more CPU, these end to end tests should instead migrate to more actual Deepspeed workloads, such as those described in the PR comments.\r\n\r\n### Why Do We Need These Changes\r\nPreviously, we only had unit tests for helper functions. These test actual workloads that a user may use DeepspeedTorchDistributor from end to end.\r\n\r\n### Any User Facing Changes\r\nNo, these are end to end tests.\r\n\r\n### How Was This Tested\r\nRunning the tests and seeing if they

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nthis PR changed the nullable of first() operator by respecting the ignoreNulls and child's nullability\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\ncopied from JIRA\r\n\r\nI found the following problem when using Spark recently:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\n\r\nval s = Seq((1.2, \"s\", 2.2)).toDF(\"v1\", \"v2\", \"v3\")\r\n\r\nval schema = StructType(Seq(StructField(\"v1\", DoubleType, nullable = false),StructField(\"v2\", StringType, nullable = true),StructField(\"v3\", DoubleType, nullable = false)))\r\n\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(s.rdd, schema)val inputDF = \r\n\r\nval inputDF = df.dropDuplicates(\"v3\")\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE local.db.table (\\n v1 DOUBLE NOT NULL,\\n v2 STRING, v3 DOUBLE NOT NULL)\")\r\n\r\ninputDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").format(\"iceberg\").save(\"local.db.table\") \r\n```\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwhen I use the above code to write to iceberg (i guess Delta Lake will have the same problem) , I got very confusing exception\r\n\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot write incompatible dataset to table with schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable \r\n\r\n{  1: v1: required double  2: v2: optional string  3: v3: required double}\r\n\r\nProvided schema:\r\n\r\ntable {  1: v1: optional double  2: v2: optional string  3: v3: required double} \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nbasically it complains that we have v1 as the nullable column in our `inputDF` which is not allowed as we created table with v1 as not nullable. The confusion comes from that,  if we check the schema with printSchema() of inputDF, v1 is not nullable\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot \r\n|-- v1: double (nullable = false) \r\n|-- v2: string (nullable = true) \r\n|-- v3: double (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly, something changed the v1's nullability unexpectedly!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter some debugging I found that the key is that `dropDuplicates(\"v3\")`. In optimization phase, we have `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate` to replace the Deduplicate with aggregate on v3 and run first() over all other columns. However, first() operator has hard coded nullable as always \"true\" which is the source of the changed nullability of v1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is a very confusing behavior of Spark, and probably no one really noticed as we do not care too much without the new table formats like delta lake and iceberg which can make nullability check correctly. Nowadays, when users adopt them more and more, this is surfaced up\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit test and integration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new rule to optimize the join if one side maximum number of rows is 1.\r\n\r\n- Rewrite inner like join or left semi join to filter if the maximum number of rows on the right is 1.\r\n- Rewrite inner like join to filter if the maximum number of rows on the left is 1.\r\n- Return the left side if it is left outer join the maximum number of rows on the right is 1.\r\n- Return the right side if it is right outer join and the maximum number of rows on the left is 1.\r\n- Return the left side if it is full outer join and the join condition does not exist and the maximum number of rows on the right is 1.\r\n- Return the right side if it is full outer join and join condition does not exist and the maximum number of rows on the left is 1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPushing down rewritten filters can significantly improve query performance, especially for partition filters.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test.\r\nBefore | After\r\n-- | --\r\n<img width=\"430\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-22548, Spark disables translating catalyst expressions to partial datasource filters. In fact, sometimes it can be translated as a partial data source filter.\r\n\r\nSimilar to SPARK-27698, this PR enhances `DataSourceStrategy.translateFilter` to support translate to partial predicates and pushdown to datasource. For example:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE foobar (name string, theid int) using parquet;\r\nEXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT * FROM foobar WHERE (theid > 0 AND TRIM(name) = 'mary') OR (theid > 10);\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter (((THEID#1 > 0) AND (trim(NAME#0, None) = mary)) OR (NAME#0 = fred))\r\n+- Relation spark_catalog.default.foobar[name#0,theid#1] parquet\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Filter (((THEID#1 > 0) AND (trim(NAME#0, None) = mary)) OR (NAME#0 = fred))\r\n+- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n   +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.foobar[name#0,theid#1] Batched: true, DataFilters: [(((theid#1 > 0) AND (trim(name#0, None) = mary)) OR (name#0 = fred))], Format: Parquet, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [Or(GreaterThan(theid,0),EqualTo(name,fred))], ReadSchema: struct<name:string,theid:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBut not all datasources support translate to partial predicates. For example, the original filter node is missing if a partial predicate is pushed down to JDBC, which will generate wrong results:\r\n```\r\nEXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT * FROM foobar WHERE (THEID > 0 AND TRIM(NAME) = 'mary') OR (THEID > 10);\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter (((THEID#1 > 0) AND (trim(NAME#0, None) = mary)) OR (THEID#1 > 10))\r\n+- Relation [NAME#0,THEID#1] JDBCRelation(TEST.PEOPLE) [numPartitions=1]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Scan JDBCRelation(TEST.PEOPLE) [numPartitions=1] [NAME#0,THEID#1] PushedFilters: [*Or(GreaterThan(THEID,0),GreaterThan(THEID,10))], ReadSchema: struct<NAME:string,THEID:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSupported translate to partial predicates:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/679ea56dc8be7566c32a606639aa052421136afc/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/DataSourceScanExec.scala#L383\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2994560d204c70cd17424e130dad5e3ece0988f5/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileSourceStrategy.scala#L202\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c4cd193b4d43d951255d9914f9b6f099d140fe1c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/v2/FileScanBuilder.scala#L80\r\n\r\nUnsupported

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nReplace AnalysisException to SparkException in Scala client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nScala client do not need to depend on Spark thus it cannot depend on `AnalysisException` which needs `LogicalPlan`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. This PR changes the Scala client API so that AnalysisException won't be thrown (SparkException will be the replacement).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThrough code tracking, I found that the folder corresponding to the partition on HDFS is generated by the 'AlterTableAddPartitionCommand' command, and whether the command is executed depends on whether the partition already exists in the metastore, which is the root cause of the non-idempotence. So we need to drop the updated part of the partitions from the metastore to initialize its state. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nfix issue:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44473\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nmanually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL grammar for PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clause after TABLE arguments for TVF calls.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR just includes the SQL grammar and parsing part, no analysis support is implemented yet, that will come next.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from tvf(arg1 => table(t1) partition by col1);\r\nselect * from tvf(arg1 => table(t1) partition by col1 order by col2 asc);\r\nselect * from tvf(arg1 => table(t1) partition by col1, col2 order by col2 asc, col3 desc);\r\nselect * from tvf(arg1 => table(select col1, col2, col3 from v2)\r\n    partition by col1, col2 order by col2 asc, col3 desc);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will provide a way for the TVF caller to indicate desired semantics for dividing up the rows of the input table into partitions for consumption by the underlying algorithm.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds new SQL grammar.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new parser unit tests. Currently the parser returns \"not implemented yet\" error for these cases, and we will implement analysis for them next.","created_at":"2023-07-20T22:29:59Z","updated_at":"2023-07-24T23:09:05Z","closed_at":"2023-07-24T23:08:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6cdf14fda96d72532d3dac9753f7fce4bbec2836","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42100/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42100/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42100/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d674a05d605136252670ef9d113cc14a4cf3d2b6","head":{"label":"dtenedor:partition-by-clause","ref":"partition-by-clause","sha":"d674a05d605136252670ef9d113cc14a4cf3d2b6","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously, when a new DSv2 data source is implemented during planning, it will always call `BatchScanExec:supportsColumnar` which will in turn iterate over all input partitions to check if they support columnar or not. \r\n\r\nWhen the `planInputPartitions` method is expensive this can be problematic. This patch adds an option to the Scan interface that allows specifying a default value. For backward compatibility the default value provided by the Scan interface is partition defined, but a Scan can change it accordingly.\r\n\r\nTo fully support the changes of this PR, the following additional changes had to be done:\r\n\r\n* `DataSourceV2ScanExecBase::outputPartitioning` removed the case for single partitions.\r\n* `lazyval DataSourceV2ScanExecBase::groupedPartitions` added a special check for empty key group partitioning so that the simple case does not trigger a materialization of the input partitions during planning. \r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n* Fixes similar issues as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40004\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid costly operations during explain operations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNp\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptimize several critical code path in `TreeNode.generateTreeString`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn `TreeNode.generateTreeString`, we observed inefficiency in scala collection operations and virtual function call in our internal workload.\r\n\r\nThis inefficiency become significant in large plan (we hit a example of more than 1000 nodes). So it’s worth optimizing the super hot code path. By rewriting into native Java code(not so sweet as scala syntax sugar though), we should be able to get rid of most of the overhead.\r\n\r\n- `ArrayBuffer.append`\r\n<img width=\"440\" alt=\"itable1\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR takes over https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40524 as the original author is busy with other works.\r\n\r\nIt also close #40524\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis removes the need for a time zone id when casting from StringType -> DateType and DateType -> StringType.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt is mostly for consistency with what the code is actually doing. Marking it as needing A time zone id has no real impact to the actual execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA. And `HivePartitionFilteringSuite` is updated to adapt to the change.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement Arrow `self_destruct` of `toPandas` for memory savings.\r\n\r\nNow the Spark configuration `spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.selfDestruct.enabled` can be used to enable PyArrow’s `self_destruct` feature in Spark Connect, which can save memory when creating a Pandas DataFrame via `toPandas` by freeing Arrow-allocated memory while building the Pandas DataFrame. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReach parity with vanilla PySpark. The PR is a mirror of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29818 for Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds upcasting to direct Arrow deserialization for the Spark Connect Scala Client. This is implemented by decoupling leaf encoders from vector implementations, instead all leaf encoders are now tied to an `ArrowVectorReader` instance that will allow us to read the data we need from an arbitrary vector type, provided we can read this data without data loss (this is both checked at runtime and compile time). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDirect Arrow deserialization did not support upcasting yet. Not supporting this would be a regression for connect compared to SPARK 3.4.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it brings arrow encoders up to par with the existing catalyst encoding framework.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `ArrowEncoderSuite`.\r\nRe-enabled tests that relied on upcasting.","created_at":"2023-07-19T19:20:01Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T00:46:10Z","closed_at":"2023-07-25T00:46:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d26f7e9e5eeb4ca732d2fc874a0543f96a95364","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f317fef0f672c55f094fb75b365b6c3d2b720fc0","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-44449","ref":"SPARK-44449","sha":"f317fef0f672c55f094fb75b365b6c3d2b720fc0","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen a machine has multiple network cards, we may only want users of a certain network segment to be able to connect to the connect server. I propose that in addition to specifying port, the connect server can also specify address.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/047fad5861daedbdb58111b223e76c05784f4951/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/config/Connect.scala#L26-L30\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.Connect server should can specify the bind address, improve flexibility.\r\n2.As other Spark components, a bind address can also be specified, such as:

will be available as external shuffle service metric\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding three more metrics to ShuffleMetrics (exposed by External Shuffle Service) \"totalShuffleDataBytes\", \"numAppsWithShuffleData\" and \"lastNodeShuffleMetricRefreshEpochMillis\"\r\n\r\nWe add a new daemon that scans the disk every 30s (configurable) and sums up total size of the shuffle data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdding these metrics would help in -\r\n1. Deciding if we can decommission the node if no shuffle data present\r\n2. Better live monitoring of customer's workload to see if there is skewed shuffle data present on the node\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis documentation will need to be updated on next release:\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#component-instance--shuffleservice\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUTs are added\r\nAlso tested manually on a YARN cluster and metrics are getting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces a stub class loader for unpacking Scala UDFs in the driver and the executor. When encountering user classes that are not found on the server session classpath, the stub class loader would try to stub the class.\r\n\r\nThis solves the problem that when serializing UDFs, Java serializer might include unnecessary user code e.g. User classes used in the lambda definition signatures in the same class where the UDF is defined.\r\n\r\nIf the user code is actually needed to execute the UDF, we will return an error message to suggest the user to add the missing classes using the `addArtifact` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo enhance the user experience of UDF. This PR should be merged to master and 3.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test both for Scala 2.12 & 2.13\r\n\r\n4 tests in SparkSessionE2ESuite still fail to run with maven after the fix because the client test jar is installed on the system classpath (added using --jar at server start), the stub classloader can only stub classes missing from the session classpath (added using `session.addArtifact`).\r\n\r\nMoving the test jar to the session classpath causes failures in tests for `flatMapGroupsWithState` (SPARK-44576). Finish moving the test jar to session classpath once `flatMapGroupsWithState` test failures are fixed.","created_at":"2023-07-19T05:23:19Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T01:45:38Z","closed_at":"2023-07-29T02:59:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a735db3cf7a8feaac796950cfca0148f5c72cc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0290c586b07f59e546e445390f7a5d343c2f7a6c","head":{"label":"zhenlineo:ref-spark-result","ref":"ref-spark-result","sha":"0290c586b07f59e546e445390f7a5d343c2f7a6c","user":{"login":"zhenlineo","id":4190164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4190164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":464980742,"node_id":"R_kgDOG7cLBg","name":"spark","full_name":"zhenlineo/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhenlineo","id":4190164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4190164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMade the DeepspeedTorchDistributor run() method use the _run() function as the backbone.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt allows the user to run distributed training of a function with deepspeed easily. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis adds the ability for the user to pass in a function as the train_object when calling DeepspeedTorchDistributor.run(). The user must have all necessary imports within the function itself, and the function must be picklable. An example use case can be found in the python file linked in the JIRA ticket. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNotebook/file linked in the JIRA ticket. Formal e2e tests will come in future PR.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps/Timeline\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add more e2e tests for both running a regular pytorch file and running a function for training\r\n- [ ] Write more documentation\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-19T02:15:32Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T08:29:50Z","closed_at":"2023-07-19T08:29:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4d61546af02194dad33088500790d7889f305ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fa3d8d60c5a5975e799a93bd796e12e7abb50bc9","head":{"label":"mathewjacob1002:add_func_deepspeed","ref":"add_func_deepspeed","sha":"fa3d8d60c5a5975e799a93bd796e12e7abb50bc9","user":{"login":"mathewjacob1002","id":134338709,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAHYlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134338709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002","html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":659420972,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ033LA","name":"spark","full_name":"mathewjacob1002/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mathewjacob1002","id":134338709,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAHYlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134338709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002","html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002/spark","description":"Apache

uses `TypeCheckResult.TypeCheckFailure` to indicate input type check failure. `TypeCheckResult.TypeCheckFailure` appears to be deprecated in favor of `TypeCheckResult.DataTypeMismatch`, but recently two expressions were added that use `TypeCheckResult.TypeCheckFailure`: `BitmapCount` and `BitmapOrAgg`.\r\n\r\n`BitmapCount` and `BitmapOrAgg` should probably be fixed to use `TypeCheckResult.DataTypeMismatch`. Regardless, the code in `CheckAnalysis` that handles `TypeCheckResult.TypeCheckFailure` should either be fixed or removed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFinished is emitted in SparkConnectPlanExecution after the arrow conversion job is completed. However, since we don't await the completion of the job, it's possible for SparkConnectPlanExecution to complete before sending Finished. \r\nClosed is emitted in SparkConnectExecutePlanHandler in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nAdd await in order to guarantee the order of events between Finished & Closed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Test observe response` at SparkConnectServiceSuite was disabled as flaky after [introduction of events](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41443). Failure surfaced race condition in emitting the Finished & Closed events for Connect request of type plan. The correct order of events is Finished < Closed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen a `JobArtifactSet` is created form a specific `JobArtifactState`, an empty collection of files/jars/archives is returned if there have previously been no associated artifacts of that specific type rather than all files/jars/archives.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nConsider each artifact type - files/jars/archives. For each artifact type, the following bug exists:\r\n\r\n1. Initialise a `JobArtifactState` with no artifacts added to it.\r\n2. Create a  `JobArtifactSet` from the `JobArtifactState`.\r\n3. Add an artifact with the same active `JobArtifactState`.\r\n4. Create another `JobArtifactSet`\r\n\r\nIn the current behaviour, the set created in step 2 contains all existing artifacts of that type (through `sc.allAddedFiles` for example) while step 4 would only contain the single artifact added in step 3.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. (Bug-fix addresses the previously incorrect user behaviour)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit test in `JobArtifactSetSuite`.","created_at":"2023-07-18T14:45:37Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T00:37:01Z","closed_at":"2023-07-19T00:37:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"931dc7a09f525f0f874fe2673964b6a3ca47ebf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0564bd32d5ac6362c8d4a2e63bb4ce31fbef8976","head":{"label":"vicennial:SPARK-44476","ref":"SPARK-44476","sha":"0564bd32d5ac6362c8d4a2e63bb4ce31fbef8976","user":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402021456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIwMjE0NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vicennial/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial/spark","description":"Apache

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix the bug in issue [SPARK-42972](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42972).\r\n\r\nwhen there are only very less executors, the program will be very weak, once the executors are all dead, the driver will never notice this and the whole program will hang.\r\n\r\n**Why it happened**\r\nWhen all executors are dead, there will be no more batches complete, so the _batchProcTimeCount_ will always be zero because it only increases in _onBatchCompleted()_ method and its initial values is zero and will always be set zero in ._manageAllocation()_ method.\r\nIn _manageAllocation()_ method, manager will only judge wether to call  _requestExecutors()_ method  when _batchProcTimeCount_ is greater than zero.\r\nThe manager will only get new executors when calling _requestExecutors()_ method. \r\n\r\nNo executors -> no batch complete -> batchProcTimeCount is zero -> never call requestExecutors -> no executors\r\n\r\nThis will cause the streaming apps hang. No more batches complete causes _batchProcTimeCount_ always equal to zero; _batchProcTimeCount_ always equal to zero causes the manager never judge whether to call method _requestExecutors_; manager never call method _requestExecutors_ causes that there will no longer be executors to complete new batches. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI test this in our cluster and the spark streaming app runs normally.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-18T07:48:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T00:19:18Z","closed_at":"2023-11-20T00:19:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8109f1ad4b7f032be79e7ffaae45a1f64015e644","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1984378631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0Mzc4NjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAM","name":"DSTREAM","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2910c0b7c99f9808eb7c0bc7c26e84624c171485","head":{"label":"liangyu-1:SPARK-42972","ref":"SPARK-42972","sha":"2910c0b7c99f9808eb7c0bc7c26e84624c171485","user":{"login":"liangyu-1","id":62563545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTYzNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62563545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":667729839,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ8y_rw","name":"spark","full_name":"liangyu-1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liangyu-1","id":62563545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTYzNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62563545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1/spark","description":"Apache
