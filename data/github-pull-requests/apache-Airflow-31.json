https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42111\r\n\r\nWith the recent [fix](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41874) we added a check that compares a `dag.fileloc` and `dag_directory` However, we never resolve the symbolic links in `dag.fileloc` but we do resolve them for `dag_directory`. But in helm charts that uses `gitSync` we use symbolic links like:\r\n```\r\ndrwxrwsrwx 1 root    root  36 Sep 10 12:08 .\r\ndrwxrwxr-x 1 airflow root  60 Sep 10 12:04 ..\r\ndrwxr-sr-x 1   65533 root 182 Sep 10 12:08 .git\r\ndrwxr-sr-x 1   65533 root  80 Sep 10 12:08 .worktrees\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1   65533 root  51 Sep 10 12:08 repo -> .worktrees/99c104927b4b568d40d2331095c687817a580678\r\n```\r\nWhich results in a discrepancy:\r\n```\r\ndag.fileloc:  /opt/airflow/dags/repo/src/test_dags_folder.py, \r\ndag_directory : /opt/airflow/dags/.worktrees/99c104927b4b568d40d2331095c687817a580678/src \r\n```\r\nand leads to failure of the check added in the [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41874). This PR aims to resolve this issue by ignoring the  symbolic links in the `dag_directory` path.","created_at":"2024-09-10T19:10:04Z","updated_at":"2024-12-15T00:18:35Z","closed_at":"2024-12-15T00:18:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a8f07bea639514af70ec5540fd326d7b0831e3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

This was broken when that `if-else` was modified by the following PR when support for this sort of dynamic credential usage was implemented (though probably never actually tested w/o a static key + access key): https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38536/files\r\n\r\nLastly, the `(deprecated)` message is removed from the UI when creating and editing a Vault connection. That parameter is only deprecated for the `approle` auth type and is REQUIRED for `aws_iam` auth, hence why we removed that here. Users adding that parameter when using the `approle` auth method will see a deprecation message/warning still in the logs so no need to confuse users utilizing `aws_iam` in the UI.\r\n\r\n*this is a

Restructure the new api folder to include views folder `ui` for private endpoints and `public` for the public ones\r\n- Rename the `UI API` api into a more generic `FASTAPI API` for development time.\r\n- Adapted the openapi generation code and app code to have the `ui` endpoints included in the generated spec (useful for front-end code gen), but removed from the exposed fastapi docs/swagger. (I don't think private `ui` endpoint should appear in the `/docs`, otherwise users might be tempted to use them).\r\n\r\nA follow up PR will come that will migrate the first legacy **public** endpoint to the new fastapi.

This argument was present in version 2.9, but for reasons that are unclear (or that I may have missed in my search), it seems to have been removed in the current version.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the docstring for the method still references the executor argument, which suggests a discrepancy between the code and its documentation. Given this inconsistency, I am submitting this PR to restore the executor=None argument, ensuring that the method signature aligns with its intended functionality and the existing documentation.","created_at":"2024-09-09T13:15:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T20:18:40Z","closed_at":"2024-09-09T20:14:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a62c3895d19f20eb9bf46eb303ce20b30240b667","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/42102/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/42102/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/42102/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f852adc9891d7196c5f97c329ca7905fe7629465","head":{"label":"wonseokyang-de:main","ref":"main","sha":"f852adc9891d7196c5f97c329ca7905fe7629465","user":{"login":"wonseokyang-de","id":62360849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzYwODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62360849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de","html_url":"https://github.com/wonseokyang-de","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":854576480,"node_id":"R_kgDOMu_NYA","name":"airflow","full_name":"wonseokyang-de/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wonseokyang-de","id":62360849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzYwODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62360849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de","html_url":"https://github.com/wonseokyang-de","followers_url":"https://api.github

Improvement of Kerberos Authentication \r\n \r\n Summary \r\n As a result of addition of new AI-driven metrics and the optimization of the codes drawn into the LFR (Learning Fair Representations) preprocessing algorithm, the algorithm has been advanced. Such updates are, for example, the possibility of calculating disparity ratios or an improved fixture management as well as parameterized testing. The script also contains some enhancements in the naming of the functions making them more readable as well as adhering to the Python standards. \r\n \r\n Discussions \r\n Pay attention to the fairness metrics and improve the testing LFR as a framework. \r\n\r\n QA Instructions \r\n Check calculation of the fairness metrics and test the LFR algorithm to a sufficient extent.\r\n \r\n Merge Plan \r\n Make it a rule to read all the metrics and testing updates before merging in order to avoid making changes to the wrong file. \r\n \r\nMotivation and Context \r\n It also guarantees that all the fairness concerns are taken care of by the incorporation of AI-generated metrics, besides the quality of the code being enhanced through the new testing procedure and other improvements in the script. \r\n \r\n Types of Changes \r\n Feature addition: Fairness metrics. \r\n Testing enhancement: Advanced testing framework is that it has the provision to set up different test environments depending on the needs of testing. \r\n Code improvement: Some of the improvements made are; better naming of functions and improved readability. \r\n Here's a structured explanation for your pull request:Here's a structured explanation for your pull request: \r\n \r\n Summary \r\n This update improves Kerberos authentication since the update includes a detection of any anomaly using an AI system. The new model incorporates the IsolationForest to capture the anomalous pattern of the authentication which in turn increase security by identifying security threats. The examples are processed and normalized using the StandardScaler to the user behavior data that can be further analyzed for anomalies Detection of the system and it is monitored and analyzed for the improvement of the user behavior in real-time. \r\n \r\n Related Issues \r\n N/A \r\n Discussions \r\n This has to do with how the anomaly detection through AI enhances the security of Kerberos authentication. \r\n QA Instructions \r\n It is pertinent that one should test an anomaly detection under different set of authentication settings. \r\n Merge Plan \r\n Just make sure that anomaly detection is functional and has been tested before they are merged. \r\n Motivation and Context \r\n These advancements in anomaly detection can make Kerberos more secure and offers better protection with the integration of better more intelligent AI approach. \r\n \r\n Types of Changes \r\n Feature addition: AI based anomaly detection. \r\n Security enhancement: Real-time monitoring and managing of user behavioral patterns and real time handling of abnormal activity. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

sure we are taking a stronger lock than we need to.\r\n\r\nWhy this matters:\r\n\r\nTaking the weaker lock FOR KEY SHARE UPDATE allows other tables to do concurrent inserts with fks to the locked row.   This matters e.g. when we insert a task reschedule that keys to dag run.  \r\n\r\nRight now we wait (before inserting reschedule) to be able to lock the row on dag run.  But if you have many failures close in time this can be trouble.  And it's unnecessary since we're just inserting a row with a fk to dag run.  But logic was added to fully lock the dag run because there were reported deadlocks.  But if we use the weaker lock in the first place, that would not be an issue.\r\n\r\nAnd since, as far as i know, we're not ever going to change the key of the locked row, it should always be safe to do this.\r\n\r\nHere's some relevant docs https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-ROWS\r\n\r\nAnd this table shows which types of locks conflict with which.\r\n\r\n<img

In current version with `data-require-confirmation=\"{{ appbuilder.require_confirmation_dag_change }}\"` resulting value on JS side in [onChange](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/static/js/dag.js#L58) function has `String` type and does not automatically converts to boolean, which causes incorrect check:\r\n```js\r\n...\r\nconst requireConfirmation = $input.data(\"require-confirmation\");  // has String type, non-empty\r\nif (requireConfirmation) { // evaluates to true on non-empty strings\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding `lower` on jinja side does the trick and seems like simplest fix, resulting string successfully converts to boolean. After that confirmation window shows up only when passing `True` to `require_confirmation_dag_change`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful
