This is similar to Python SDK ([apiclient.py](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/dataflow/internal/apiclient.py#L1141-L1147))\r\n\r\nThere is no existing \"java\" image for 2.XX.0 and beam-master-YYYYMMDD, so this won't break anything for users. Any tests that break should be fixed, since they are not correctly overriding the URL if they break.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

stores timer state, event time and processing time timers alike, in the form of a `MapState<TimerKey<K>, Long>`. `TimerKey`, however, doesn't include the `TimerFamilyId` and therefore the timer family information is not persisted. On the other hand, event time timers uses an additional time sorted set to persist the TimerData(which contains TimerFamilyId). We need to include timer family id in the TimerKey to ensure that it is persisted for Processing time timers.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `TimerFamilyId` to `TimerKey`. Additionally, I am switching to the use of `AutoValue` to reduce boilerplate code.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

TimerKey, however, doesn't include the `TimerFamilyId` and is therefore not persisted. On the other hand, event time timers uses an additional time sorted set to persist the TimerData(which contains TimerFamilyId). We need to include timer family id in the TimerKey to ensure that it is persisted.\r\n\r\nPre-Commit Tests Status (on master

a check to make sure that the PCollection is either bounded, not using global windowing, or not using a default trigger. Also fixes anything that relied on this check not being made.\r\n\r\nDraft Notes:\r\n\r\nThis seems to work as intended, but it is causing failures in `assert_that` in testing/util.py.  Some stuff I've tried:\r\n\r\n* Apply non-default triggers to one or both input PCollections\r\n* Change to use Flatten() | Filter(...) | Map(...)\r\n* Pass the input PCollection as side input to `Map` using `pvalue.AsList`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

wasn't being properly propagated. This also preserves any hierarchical indexing from the dataframes. There is one problem with passing dataframes, however, which is that the indexing isn't kept and is reset per bundle. This solves this by resetting the index once the DataFrame is collected but only if it is an unnamed index. This behavior can be overridden with the `reset_unnamed_indexes=False` flag.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

UUIDs being random for every instance doesn't work for Go, which relies significantly on a deterministic identifier registry between worker and main program binary.\r\n\r\nMake the UUIDs deterministic based on the type name. The schema spec, such as it is only requires that two types with the same UUID are identical, which this method can support.\r\n\r\nThis is largely an issue when trying to avoid deviations to the reflect libraries to do type conversions, which can tolerate converting a synthetic type to an equivalent specific type.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

improvements\r\n   - Reduce cache timeout to a value smaller than the server-side timeout. This prevents us from hitting errors when we try to use a StreamWriter that has timed out on the server.\r\n   - Reduce maximum retry interval to 10 seconds.\r\n   -  Bound the bundle size to the StorageApiWriteXXXRecords classes by using GroupIntoBatches. Previously we would sometimes get very large bundles, and due to the design of the sink we cannot flush the writes until the entire bundle has been written. Bounding the bundle size allows us to flush these items more quickly.","created_at":"2021-05-08T06:40:57Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T02:47:34Z","closed_at":"2021-05-26T02:47:34Z","merged_at":"2021-05-26T02:47:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"79c1932af6df31c677676a43afd6f68406225686","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/14765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/14765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/14765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4ad9651c9419df2066ee2854a6e57ae4b860d251","head":{"label":"reuvenlax:vortex_sink_tail_latency","ref":"vortex_sink_tail_latency","sha":"4ad9651c9419df2066ee2854a6e57ae4b860d251","user":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72963016,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Mjk2MzAxNg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"reuvenlax/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

the Go Dataflow runner to stage cross-language artifacts to GCP as well, and adds them to the list of packages for workers. This fixes a few failing cross-language pipelines that required artifacts to be read. Also refactors the artifact staging code slightly to allow for staging remotely in a more generic fashion, and not just to GCP.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

@pabloem \r\n\r\nI have a process that runs every day to process users in the BigQuery and send their information to Google Marketing tools, such as Google Analytics, Campaign Manager, etc.\r\nWhen using the Python SDK it generates a distinct temporary dataset every day that is not removed and does not have an expiration date.\r\nI added a command to remove the temporary dataset after removing the temporary table created after reading the data from BigQuery.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

currently uses AWS DescribeStream API to list Kinesis shards. There are few problems with it:\r\n- it is deprecated as per AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-list-shards.html)\r\n- it is slow, as it requires additional validation of listed shards (it returns all of them, including closed ones, so GetShardIterator calls are required)\r\n- it has low transaction limit per second (per account)\r\n- AWS changed the behaviour of GetShardIterator (it returns iterator for closed shards) and because of that Beam might read too old data, leading to increase in costs and delay\r\n\r\nUse of ListShards API eliminates problems mentioned above.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

There's call to this method in testSQLLimit: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/2d253f915003279878b77827301428649881bec7/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/meta/provider/pubsub/PubsubTableProviderIT.java#L442-L443\r\n\r\nIt should be timing out and failing the test but instead hangs indefinitely. Note I have not yet  root caused the issue in testSQLLimit, so this will not completely fix SQL PostCommit.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

new connector for Cloud Firestore is being added to Beam and currently out for review (see #14261). Some of the features and adjustments are useful for Cloud Datastore as well, so they're being backported to this connector.  \r\n\r\n### Ramp-up throttling\r\n\r\nThis follows the same implementation as the Firetore connector, though implemented as a subtransform in the Write/Delete PTransform for simplicity and so the change is more easily visible.  \r\nIn essence, the ramp-up throttler is a generic rate limiter that emits elements only when there is sufficient \"budget\". This budget starts at 500 entities per second (split across workers) and increases by 50% every 5 minutes, as documented under [Datastore Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/best-practices#ramping_up_traffic). Abiding by this rule is not always necessary, the throttling step can be turned off in that case.\r\n\r\n### Minor tweaks\r\n\r\nThere have been minor tweaks and adjustments to some of the constants along the way.\r\n\r\n* Raised target latency for automatic batch sizing from 5 to 6 seconds.\r\n* Decreased initial batch size from 200 to 50.\r\n* Decresed minimum batch size from 10 to 5.\r\n* Added the Beam version to the user agent provided to the Datastore client for easier debugging by the Datastore team. The version of package `google-cloud-datastore` had to be bumped from 1.7.1 to 1.8.0 for that, which is a non-breaking change.\r\n\r\nR: @chamikaramj \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

produces (N*2)-1 buckets, where N is the value of the user-defined numBuckets parameter. This is because the value of the  variable having the remainder operator applied, hashOfShard, can be negative and Java's `%` operator has the semantics of `remainder` rather than `modulus`. \r\n\r\nIs it intentional to produce  (N*2)-1 buckets?\r\n\r\nWe should consider the implications of changing this Reshuffle behavior for use cases already employing AssignToShard. Until recently (28 days ago[2]) the class was private, plus Reshuffle is marked as deprecated, so I imagine the impact would be low?\r\n\r\n[1] \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/abbe14f721327d51cce02876324e7feba98581e2/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/Reshuffle.java#L160\r\n[2] \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/commit/abbe14f721327d51cce02876324e7feba98581e2\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
