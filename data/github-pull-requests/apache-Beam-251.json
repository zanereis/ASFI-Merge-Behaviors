sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis would likely have caught some hard-to-diagnose (for me, new to the runner) type safety errors during the development of `StatefulParDoEvaluatorFactory`, so adding it should hopefully catch similar bugs in the future. As we discussed `InputT` is more useful and reasonable than `OutputT` but there are a number of places where they each line up and might add a little something.\r\n\r\nIt adds some boilerplate, to be sure, and is still mostly type unsafe since there are lots of methods with generics only on the return type. Opening this for consideration / discussion.\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh
