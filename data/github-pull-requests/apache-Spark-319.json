What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the batch queries, timeout is disabled (i.e. GroupStateTimeout.NoTimeout) which means any GroupState.setTimeout*** operation would throw UnsupportedOperationException. This makes it weird when converting a streaming query into a batch query by changing the input DF from streaming to a batch DF. If the timeout was enabled and used, then the batch query will start throwing UnsupportedOperationException.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates the dummy state in batch queries with the provided timeoutConf so that it behaves in the same way. The code has been refactored to make it obvious when the state is being created for a batch query or a streaming query.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdditional

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRevert the handling of negative values in ALS with implicit feedback, so that the confidence is the absolute value of the rating and the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances `ColumnVector` to keep `UnsafeArrayData` for array to use `ColumnVector` for table cache (e.g. CACHE table, DataFrame.cache). Other complex types such as Map and struct will be addressed by another PR if it is OK.\r\n\r\nCurrent `ColumnVector` accepts only primitive-type Java array as an input for array. It is good to keep data from Parquet.\r\n\r\nThis PR changed or added the following APIs:\r\n\r\n`ColumnVector ColumnVector.allocate(int capacity, DataType type, MemoryMode mode, boolean useUnsafeArrayData)`\r\n* When the last is true, the `ColumnVector` can keep `UnsafeArrayData`. If it is false, the `ColumnVector` cannot keep `UnsafeArrayData`. \r\n\r\n`int ColumnVector.putArray(int rowId, ArrayData array)`\r\n* When this `ColumnVector` was generated with `useUnsafeArrayData=true`, this method stores `UnsafeArrayData` into `ColumnVector`. Otherwise, throw an exception.\r\n\r\n`ArrayData ColumnVector.getArray(int rowId)`\r\n* When this `ColumnVector` was generated with `useUnsafeArrayData=true`, this method returns  `UnsafeArrayData`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdate existing testsuite\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-17T08:57:59Z","updated_at":"2017-10-28T08:03:45Z","closed_at":"2017-10-28T08:03:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c42e987f2b8b2f055e3c815a61802ef62e10777","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18014/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18014/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18014/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9954d6b20d3ed5743100d342b8b8102f60f8f9f2","head":{"label":"kiszk:OnHeapColumnVector","ref":"OnHeapColumnVector","sha":"9954d6b20d3ed5743100d342b8b8102f60f8f9f2","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd support for specific Java `List` subtypes in deserialization as well as a generic implicit encoder.\r\n\r\nAll `List` subtypes are supported by using either the size-specifying constructor (one `int` parameter) or the default constructor.\r\n\r\nInterfaces/abstract classes use the following implementations:\r\n\r\n* `java.util.List`, `java.util.AbstractList` or `java.util.AbstractSequentialList` => `java.util.ArrayList`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbuild/mvn -DskipTests clean package && dev/run-tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally in Spark shell:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> val jlist = new java.util.LinkedList[Int]; jlist.add(1)\r\njlist: java.util.LinkedList[Int] = [1]\r\nres0: Boolean =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn \r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --master=local[64]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran \r\n\r\n``` \r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 100000).count()\r\n```\r\nand profiled the time spend in the LiveListenerBus event processing thread. I discovered that the majority of the time was being spent in `TaskMetrics.empty` calls in `JobProgressListener.onTaskStart`. It turns out that we can slightly refactor to remove the need to construct one empty instance per call, greatly improving the performance of this code.\r\n\r\nThe performance gains here help to avoid an issue where listener events would be dropped because the JobProgressListener couldn't keep up with the throughput.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/26133095/95bcd42a-3a59-11e7-8051-a50550e447b8.png)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/26133070/7935e148-3a59-11e7-8c2d-73d5aa5a2397.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##

quadratic List indexing in ParquetWriteSupport.\r\n\r\nI noticed this function while profiling some code with today. It showed up as a significant factor in a table with twenty columns; with hundreds of columns, it could dominate any other function call.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe writeFields method iterates from 0 until number of fields, indexing into rootFieldWriters for each element. rootFieldWriters is a List, so indexing is a linear operation. The complexity of the writeFields method is thus quadratic in the number of fields.\r\n\r\nSolution: explicitly convert rootFieldWriters to Array (implicitly converted to WrappedArray) for constant-time indexing. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is a one-line change for performance reasons.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-16T19:40:31Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T12:20:12Z","closed_at":"2017-05-19T12:20:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26b7ff32ded50d2eed1147c6d5112ef433ea9013","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/72c5487d39424fe82c1c6030246ca891355b176f","head":{"label":"tpoterba:tpoterba-patch-1","ref":"tpoterba-patch-1","sha":"72c5487d39424fe82c1c6030246ca891355b176f","user":{"login":"tpoterba","id":10562794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYyNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10562794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba","html_url":"https://github.com/tpoterba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":91496156,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MTQ5NjE1Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"tpoterba/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tpoterba","id":10562794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYyNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10562794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba","html_url":"https://github.com/tpoterba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpoterba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tpoterba/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen the queue of the LiveListener is full, events are dropped in an arbitrary fashion. \r\nBut some of them can be crucial for the good execution of the job. The job doesn t in general fail immediately, but presents incoherent state before dying.\r\n In this pull request:\r\n the queue implementation was refactored to increase  a bit the performances\r\n (reduce object allocation & decrease lock usage)\r\n A \"waiting for space\" strategy is introduced and can be used instead of\r\n the default and current \"dropping\" strategy.\r\n The new strategy even if it does not resolve the \"real\" problem\r\n (the small dequeing rate) brings a lot more stability to the jobs with a\r\n  huge event production rate (i.e jobs with many partitions).\r\nThe EventLogListener which is the most time-consuming listener (see the attached files in the Jira issue for timings) is now asynchronous (not the default implementation, but a new version which is configurable with a simple parameter)\r\n\r\n  ## How was this patch tested?\r\n  Existing unit tests have been enriched to run on both strategy.\r\n  + manual tests have been run on the cluster\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-16T17:53:20Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T22:16:27Z","closed_at":"2017-06-21T22:16:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd2fbd2eebf7f85cf538cf9b52c1a7c3a64116b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c789da4e21c01e4803f206eaf8fcd463d733b743","head":{"label":"bOOm-X:master","ref":"master","sha":"c789da4e21c01e4803f206eaf8fcd463d733b743","user":{"login":"bOOm-X","id":1289120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X","html_url":"https://github.com/bOOm-X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bOOm-X/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1665b5f724b486068a62c9c72dfd7ed76807c1b3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the implementation of `ColumnStats` by using the following appoaches.\r\n\r\n1. Declare subclasses of `ColumnStats` as `final` \r\n2. Remove unnecessary call of `row.isNullAt(ordinal)` \r\n3. Remove the dependency on `GenericInternalRow`\r\n\r\nFor 1., this declaration encourages method inlining and other optimizations of JIT compiler\r\nFor 2., in `gatherStats()`, while previous code in subclasses of `ColumnStats` always calls `row.isNullAt()` twice, the PR just calls `row.isNullAt()` only once.\r\nFor 3., `collectedStatistics()` returns `Array[Any]` instead of `GenericInternalRow`. This removes the dependency of unnecessary package and reduces the number of allocations of `GenericInternalRow`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, in the future, `gatherValueStats()`, which is specialized for each data type, can be effectively called from the generated code without using generic data structure `InternalRow`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by existing test suite","created_at":"2017-05-16T15:58:41Z","updated_at":"2017-05-22T10:07:43Z","closed_at":"2017-05-22T08:26:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59a12aa0822a5036bc273f64b0648854fbc0f4dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18002/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18002/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18002/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/66fefb6a8a0ddf1d1dc9318e5320506987da9c59","head":{"label":"kiszk:SPARK-20770","ref":"SPARK-20770","sha":"66fefb6a8a0ddf1d1dc9318e5320506987da9c59","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative workaround by simply avoiding the predicate pushdown for columns having dots in the names. This is an approach different with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17680.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this PR is, literally it does not push down filters on the column having dots in Parquet files at all (both no record level and no rowgroup level) whereas the downside of the approach in that PR, it does not use the Parquet's API properly but in a hacky way to support this case.\r\n\r\nI assume we prefer a safe way here by using the Parquet API properly but this does close that PR as we are basically just avoiding here.\r\n\r\nThis way looks a simple workaround and probably it is fine given the problem looks arguably rather corner cases (although it might end up with reading whole row groups under the hood but either looks not the best).\r\n\r\nCurrently, if there are dots in the column name, predicate pushdown seems being failed in Parquet.\r\n\r\n**With dots**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval path = \"/tmp/abcde\"\r\nSeq(Some(1), None).toDF(\"col.dots\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).where(\"`col.dots` IS NOT NULL\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------+\r\n|col.dots|\r\n+--------+\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Without dots**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval path = \"/tmp/abcde\"\r\nSeq(Some(1), None).toDF(\"coldots\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).where(\"`coldots` IS NOT NULL\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-------+\r\n|coldots|\r\n+-------+\r\n|      1|\r\n+-------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval path = \"/tmp/abcde\"\r\nSeq(Some(1), None).toDF(\"col.dots\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).where(\"`col.dots` IS NOT NULL\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------+\r\n|col.dots|\r\n+--------+\r\n|       1|\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests added in `ParquetFilterSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-16T13:52:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T01:04:45Z","closed_at":"2017-05-18T17:55:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d5ef3016cfee74e6f4d5d237f4a30a2c97af4e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1eae64aa2d0618085c4d48fd033d6ed4a4aca8b2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-20364-workaround","ref":"SPARK-20364-workaround","sha":"1eae64aa2d0618085c4d48fd033d6ed4a4aca8b2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now in the explain plan / UI, we have no way to tell whether a query is writing data out, and also there is no way to associate metrics with data writes. We should add an operator for writing data out. This operator can be used to track writing data out and related metrics.\r\n\r\n### The Approach\r\n\r\nWe have several paths for writing data out through some `RunnableCommand` classes.\r\n\r\n#### File-based relation: `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`, `InsertIntoHiveTable`\r\n\r\nThose commands use `FileFormatWriter` to write out data files. We can record some metrics in `FileFormatWriter` and update it later. `FileFormatWriter` accepts a `QueryExecution`. We can track the execution plan of `QueryExecution`.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new operator `WriteDataFileOutExec`. It is simply used to track the metrics of writing data file out for file-based relations. Currently we track some metrics:\r\n\r\n* number of written files\r\n* number of dynamic partitions\r\n* bytes of written files\r\n* number of output rows\r\n* writing data out time (ms)\r\n\r\n#### Other datasources: `InsertIntoDataSourceCommand`, `SaveIntoDataSourceCommand`\r\n\r\nFor other datasource relations, the logic of writing data out is delegated to the datasource implementations, e.g., `InsertableRelation.insert`, `CreatableRelationProvider.createRelation`. The APIs basically take a `DataFrame` for the data to write. Those APIs can possibly create new `DataFrame` based on the give one. So we can't easily track its execution, and theoretically we don't know the details of the API implementation in those datasources. So we can't obtain enough metrics.\r\n\r\nNote: `SaveIntoDataSourceCommand`  can possibly go to invoke `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` for file-based data sources. For this case, the metrics should be tracked as `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`.\r\n\r\nNote: `CreateDataSourceTableAsSelectCommand` works similarly as `SaveIntoDataSourceCommand`.\r\n\r\nNote: `CreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand` inserts data by invoking `InsertIntoHiveTable`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

contains scala classes\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change ensures that all references to guava from within the yarn shuffle jar pointed to the shaded guava class already provided in the jar.\r\n\r\nAlso, it explicitly excludes scala classes from being added to the jar.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan unit tests on the module and they passed.\r\njavap now returns the expected result - reference to the shaded guava under `org/spark_project` (previously this was referring to `com.google...`\r\n```\r\njavap -cp common/network-yarn/target/scala-2.11/spark-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT-yarn-shuffle.jar -c org/apache/spark/network/yarn/YarnShuffleService | grep Lists\r\n      57: invokestatic  #138                // Method org/spark_project/guava/collect/Lists.newArrayList:()Ljava/util/ArrayList;\r\n```\r\n\r\nGuava is still shaded in the jar:\r\n```\r\njar -tf common/network-yarn/target/scala-2.11/spark-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT-yarn-shuffle.jar | grep guava | head\r\nMETA-INF/maven/com.google.guava/\r\nMETA-INF/maven/com.google.guava/guava/\r\nMETA-INF/maven/com.google.guava/guava/pom.properties\r\nMETA-INF/maven/com.google.guava/guava/pom.xml\r\norg/spark_project/guava/\r\norg/spark_project/guava/annotations/\r\norg/spark_project/guava/annotations/Beta.class\r\norg/spark_project/guava/annotations/GwtCompatible.class\r\norg/spark_project/guava/annotations/GwtIncompatible.class\r\norg/spark_project/guava/annotations/VisibleForTesting.class\r\n```\r\n(not sure if the above META-INF/* is a problem or not)\r\n\r\nI took this jar, deployed it on a yarn cluster with shuffle service enabled, and made sure the YARN node managers came up. An application with a shuffle was run and it succeeded.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe issue of SPARK-6628 is:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat \r\n```\r\ncannot be cast to\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveOutputFormat\r\n```\r\nThe reason is:\r\n```\r\npublic interface HiveOutputFormat<K, V> extends OutputFormat<K, V> {…}\r\n\r\npublic class HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat extends\r\n    TableOutputFormat<ImmutableBytesWritable> implements\r\n    OutputFormat<ImmutableBytesWritable, Object> {...}\r\n```\r\nFrom the two snippets above, we can see both `HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat` and `HiveOutputFormat` `extends`/`implements` `OutputFormat`, and can not cast to each other. \r\n\r\nSpark initials the `outputFormat` in `SparkHiveWriterContainer` of Spark 1.6, 2.0, 2.1 (or: in `HiveFileFormat` of Spark 2.2 /Master)\r\n```\r\n@transient private lazy val outputFormat =\r\n        jobConf.value.getOutputFormat.asInstanceOf[HiveOutputFormat[AnyRef, Writable]]\r\n```\r\nNotice: this file output format is  `HiveOutputFormat`. However, when users write the data into the hbase, the outputFormat is `HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat`, it isn't instance of `HiveOutputFormat`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to make `outputFormat` to be \"null\" when the `OutputFormat` is not an instance of `HiveOutputFormat`. `outputFormat` is only used to get the file extension in function `getFileExtension()`. \r\n\r\nSpark 2.x also has this issue. We can also submit this PR to Master branch.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\nUser was trying to write to a hive-hbase table from Spark SQL using hiveContext and failing with below error:\r\n```\r\n17/03/30 20:26:08 INFO FileOutputCommitter: FileOutputCommitter skip cleanup _temporary folders under output directory:false, ignore cleanup

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-20682](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20682) is trying to improve Apache Spark to have a new ORCFileFormat based on Apache ORC for many reasons.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, this PR depends on SPARK-20682 and aims to provide a configuration to choose the default ORCFileFormat from legacy `sql/hive` module or new `sql/core` module.\r\n\r\nFor example, this configuration will affects the following operations.\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.orc(...)\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t\r\nUSING ORC\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-20682 (#17924 and #17943) are still under review, I'm inevitably including the dependent code. I'll update this and previous PR according to the review result.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with new test suites.","created_at":"2017-05-15T02:44:57Z","updated_at":"2017-12-21T17:12:08Z","closed_at":"2017-12-21T17:12:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c217f00007e3a6175f50c74db9adbe4dcc21090","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/01868abbf04ffa59cfb3c7da031ba82129373bc3","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-20728","ref":"SPARK-20728","sha":"01868abbf04ffa59cfb3c7da031ba82129373bc3","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"520d92a191c3148498087d751aeeddd683055622","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr added a new Optimizer rule to combine nested Concat. The master supports a pipeline operator '||' to concatenate strings in #17711 (This pr is follow-up). Since the parser currently generates nested Concat expressions, the optimizer needs to combine the nested expressions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `CombineConcatSuite` and `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-13T02:17:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T08:28:13Z","closed_at":"2017-05-15T08:28:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6bdbd823f3f16b61d51e661a58afc8870e307b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/676d4838b8f6d79193cc68ca44b2ae115a392ab2","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-20730","ref":"SPARK-20730","sha":"676d4838b8f6d79193cc68ca44b2ae115a392ab2","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince `constraints` in `QueryPlan` is a set, the order of filters can differ. Usually this is ok because of canonicalization. However, in `FileSourceScanExec`, its data filters and partition filters are sequences, and their orders are not canonicalized. So `def sameResult` returns different results for different orders of data/partition filters. This leads to, e.g. different decision for `ReuseExchange`, and thus results in unstable performance.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTimeout and state data are two independent entities and should be settable independently. Therefore, in the same call of the user-defined function, one should be able to set the timeout before initializing the state and also after removing the state. Whether timeouts can be set or not, should not depend on the current state, and vice versa. \r\n\r\nHowever, a limitation of the current implementation is that state cannot be null while timeout is set. This is checked lazily after the function call has completed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Updated existing unit tests that test the behavior of GroupState.setTimeout*** wrt to the current state\r\n- Added new tests that verify the disallowed cases where state is undefined but timeout is set.","created_at":"2017-05-12T03:11:57Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T17:50:11Z","closed_at":"2017-05-15T17:50:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a5931870434f1dda28d98c41d8408552b602d3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/40329404299ece70aef7ef245704978fb9d1e6f9","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-20717","ref":"SPARK-20717","sha":"40329404299ece70aef7ef245704978fb9d1e6f9","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors `ShuffleMapStage` and `MapOutputTracker` in order to simplify the management of `MapStatuses`, reduce driver memory consumption, and remove a potential source of scheduler correctness bugs.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nIn Spark there are currently two places where MapStatuses are tracked:\r\n\r\n- The `MapOutputTracker` maintains an `Array[MapStatus]` storing a single location for each map output. This mapping is used by the `DAGScheduler` for determining reduce-task locality preferences (when locality-aware reduce task scheduling is enabled) and is also used to serve map output locations to executors / tasks.\r\n- Each `ShuffleMapStage` also contains a mapping of `Array[List[MapStatus]]` which holds the complete set of locations where each map output could be available. This mapping is used to determine which map tasks need to be run when constructing `TaskSets` for the stage.\r\n\r\nThis duplication adds complexity and creates the potential for certain types of correctness bugs.  Bad things can happen if these two copies of the map output locations get out of sync. For instance, if the `MapOutputTracker` is missing locations for a map output but `ShuffleMapStage` believes that locations are available then tasks will fail with `MetadataFetchFailedException` but `ShuffleMapStage` will not be updated to reflect the missing map outputs, leading to situations where the stage will be reattempted (because downstream stages experienced fetch failures) but no task sets will be launched (because `ShuffleMapStage` thinks all maps are available).\r\n\r\nI observed this behavior in a real-world deployment. I'm still not quite sure how the state got out of sync in the first place, but we can completely avoid this class of bug if we eliminate the duplicate state.\r\n\r\n### Why we only need to track a single location for each map output\r\n\r\nI think that storing an `Array[List[MapStatus]]` in `ShuffleMapStage` is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFirst, note that this adds memory/object bloat to the driver we need one extra `List` per task. If you have millions of tasks across all stages then this can add up to be a significant amount of resources. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I believe that it's extremely uncommon that these lists will ever contain more than one entry. It's not impossible, but is very unlikely given the conditions which must occur for that to happen:\r\n\r\n- In normal operation (no task failures) we'll only run each task once and thus will have at most one output.\r\n- If speculation is enabled then it's possible that we'll have multiple attempts of a task. The TaskSetManager will [kill duplicate attempts of a task](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/04901dd03a3f8062fd39ea38d585935ff71a9248/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L717) after a task finishes successfully, reducing the likelihood that both the original and speculated task will successfully register map outputs.\r\n- There is a [comment in `TaskSetManager`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/04901dd03a3f8062fd39ea38d585935ff71a9248/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L113) which suggests that running tasks are not killed if a task set becomes a zombie. However:\r\n  - If the task set becomes a zombie due to the job being cancelled then it doesn't matter whether we record map outputs.\r\n  - If the task set became a zombie because of a stage failure (e.g. the map stage itself had a fetch failure from an upstream match stage) then I believe that the \"failedEpoch\" will be updated which may cause map outputs from still-running tasks to [be ignored](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/04901dd03a3f8062fd39ea38d585935ff71a9248/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L1213). (I'm not 100% sure on this point, though).\r\n- Even if you _do_ manage to record multiple map outputs for a stage, only a single map output is reported to / tracked by the MapOutputTracker. The only situation where the additional output locations could actually be read or used would be if a task experienced a `FetchFailure` exception. The most likely cause of a `FetchFailure` exception is an executor lost, which will have most likely caused the loss of several map tasks' output, so saving on potential re-execution of a single map task isn't a huge win if we're going to have to recompute several other lost map outputs from other tasks which ran on that lost executor. Also note that the re-population of MapOutputTracker state from state in the ShuffleMapTask only happens after the reduce stage has failed; the additional location doesn't help to prevent FetchFailures but, instead, can only reduce the amount of work when recomputing missing parent stages.\r\n\r\nGiven this, this patch chooses to do away with tracking multiple locations for map outputs and instead stores only a single location. This change removes the main distinction between the `ShuffleMapTask` and `MapOutputTracker`'s copies of this state, paving the way for storing it only in the `MapOutputTracker`.\r\n\r\n### Overview of other changes\r\n\r\n- Significantly simplified the cache / lock management inside of the `MapOutputTrackerMaster`:\r\n  - The old code had several parallel `HashMap`s which had to be guarded by maps of `Object`s which were used as locks. This code was somewhat complicated to follow.\r\n  - The new code uses a new `ShuffleStatus` class to group together all of the state associated with a particular shuffle, including cached serialized map statuses, significantly simplifying the logic.\r\n- Moved more code out of the shared `MapOutputTracker` abstract base class and into the `MapOutputTrackerMaster` and `MapOutputTrackerWorker` subclasses. This makes it easier to reason about which functionality needs to be supported only on the driver or executor.\r\n- Removed a bunch of code from the `DAGScheduler` which was used to synchronize information from the `MapOutputTracker` to `ShuffleMapStage`.\r\n- Added comments to clarify the role of `MapOutputTrackerMaster`'s `epoch` in invalidating executor-side shuffle map output caches. \r\n\r\nI will comment on these changes via inline GitHub review comments.\r\n\r\n/cc @hvanhovell and @rxin (whom I discussed this with offline), @tgravescs (who recently worked on caching of serialized MapOutputStatuses), and @kayousterhout and @markhamstra (for scheduler changes).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. I purposely avoided making interface / API which would require significant updates or modifications to test code.","created_at":"2017-05-11T23:10:22Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T01:50:02Z","closed_at":"2017-06-12T01:49:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd8cf3b13f4f716bff26d1d90b32e684f434fed9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4550f616a4f9c144a2da49a31ef3eaa19a0eeea8","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:map-output-tracker-rewrite","ref":"map-output-tracker-rewrite","sha":"4550f616a4f9c144a2da49a31ef3eaa19a0eeea8","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore 2.2, MLlib keep to remove APIs deprecated in last feature/minor release. But from Spark 2.2, we decide to remove deprecated APIs in a major release, so we need to change corresponding annotations to tell users those will be removed in 3.0.\r\nMeanwhile, this fixed bugs in ML documents. The original ML docs can't show deprecated annotations in ```MLWriter``` and ```MLReader``` related class, we correct it in this PR.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1962026/25939889/f8c55f20-3666-11e7-9fa2-0605bfb3ed06.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1962026/25939870/e9b0d5be-3666-11e7-9765-5e04885e4b32.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince [SPARK-2883](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2883), Apache Spark supports Apache ORC inside `sql/hive` module with Hive dependency. This issue aims to add a new and faster ORC data source inside `sql/core` and to replace the old ORC data source eventually. In this issue, the latest [Apache ORC 1.4.0](https://orc.apache.org/news/2017/05/08/ORC-1.4.0/) (released yesterday) is used.\r\n\r\nThere are four key benefits.\r\n\r\n- **Speed**: Use both Spark `ColumnarBatch` and ORC `RowBatch` together later. In this PR, only `RowBatch` is used. This is faster than the current implementation in Spark. For `ColumnarBatch`, we need to benchmark and choose the fastest way to use it later. (Please refer some discussion on #17924)\r\n- **Stability**: Apache ORC 1.4.0 has many fixes and we can depend on ORC community more.\r\n- **Usability**: User can use `ORC` data sources without hive module, i.e, `-Phive`.\r\n- **Maintainability**: Reduce the Hive dependency and can remove old legacy code later.\r\n\r\nThe followings are two examples of comparisons in `OrcReadBenchmark.scala`.\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_131-b11 on Mac OS X 10.12.4\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-3615QM CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n\r\nSQL Single Int Column Scan:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen two Breeze SparseMatrices are operated, the result matrix may contain provisional 0 values extra in rowIndices and data arrays. This causes an incoherence with the colPtrs data, but Breeze get away with this incoherence by keeping a counter of the valid data.\r\n\r\nIn spark, when this matrices are converted to SparseMatrices, Sparks relies solely on rowIndices, data, and colPtrs, but these might be incorrect because of breeze internal hacks. Therefore, we need to slice both rowIndices and data, using their counter of active data\r\n\r\nThis method is at least called by BlockMatrix when performing distributed block operations, causing exceptions on valid operations.\r\n\r\nSee http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33528555/error-thrown-when-using-blockmatrix-add\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test to MatricesSuite that verifies that the conversions are valid and that code doesn't crash. Originally the same code would crash on Spark.\r\n\r\nBugfix for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently credentials file configuration is recovered from checkpoint file when Spark Streaming applicatioin is restarted, which will lead to some unwanted behaviors, for example:\r\n\r\n1. Submit Spark Streaming application using keytab file with checkpoint enabled in yarn-cluster mode.\r\n\r\n> spark-submit --master yarn-cluster --principal xxxx --keytab xxx ...\r\n\r\n2. Stop Spark Streaming application;\r\n3. Resubmit this application after a period of time (i.e. one day);\r\n4. Credentials file configuration recover from checkpoint file, so value of  \"spark.yarn.credentials.file\" points to old staging directory (i.e. hdfs://xxxx/.sparkStaging/application_xxxx/credentials-xxxx, application_xxxx is the application id of the previous application which was stopped.)\r\n4. When launching executor, ExecutorDelegationTokenUpdater will update credentials from credentials file immediately. As credentials file was generated one day ago (maybe older), it has already expired, so after a period of time the executor keeps failing.\r\n\r\nSome useful logs are shown below

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis path aims to solve the poor performance of `RDD.cartesian`. In the original method of `cartesian`, it need repeatedly fetch remotely data or recompute, so the performance is poor. In this path cache the second partition into the local with `BlockManager`. There are two advantage:\r\n\r\n- Because we cache it with `BlockManager` and set the storage level as `MEMORY_AND_DISK`, so we don't need care the OOM caused by the buffer.\r\n\r\n- Many task may depend on the same block (the second partition) for calculation, so don't remove the block when other task need it. This can reduce the times of fetching or calculate.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest enviroments:  4 Executors(10 core, 30GB Mem) in one node with(4 ssd + 7hdd)\r\nTest

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe add missing attributes into Filter in Analyzer. But we shouldn't do it through subqueries like this:\r\n\r\n    select 1 from  (select 1 from onerow t1 LIMIT 1) where  t1.c1=1\r\n\r\nThis query works in current codebase. However, the outside where clause shouldn't be able to refer `t1.c1` attribute.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is we allow subqueries in FROM have no alias names previously, it is confusing and isn't supported by various databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Oracle. We shouldn't support it too.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBecause the method `TimeZone.getTimeZone(String ID)` is synchronized on the TimeZone class, concurrent call of this method will become a bottleneck.\r\nThis especially happens when casting from string value containing timezone info to timestamp value, which uses `DateTimeUtils.stringToTimestamp()` and gets TimeZone instance on the site.\r\n\r\nThis pr makes a cache of the generated TimeZone instances to avoid the synchronization.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe query\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT 1 FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE FALSE) t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould return a single row of output because the subquery is an aggregate without a group-by and thus should return a single row. However, Spark incorrectly returns zero rows.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by SPARK-16208 / #13906, a patch which added an optimizer rule to propagate EmptyRelation through operators. The logic for handling aggregates is wrong: it checks whether aggregate expressions are non-empty for deciding whether the output should be empty, whereas it should be checking grouping expressions instead:\r\n\r\nAn aggregate with non-empty grouping expression will return one output row per group. If the input to the grouped aggregate is empty then all groups will be empty and thus the output will be empty. It doesn't matter whether the aggregation output columns include aggregate expressions since that won't affect the number of output rows.\r\n\r\nIf the grouping expressions are empty, however, then the aggregate will always produce a single output row and thus we cannot propagate the EmptyRelation.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is incorrect and also misses an optimization opportunity by not propagating EmptyRelation in the case where a grouped aggregate has aggregate expressions (in other words, `SELECT COUNT(*) from emptyRelation GROUP BY x` would _not_ be optimized to `EmptyRelation` in the old code, even though it safely could be).\r\n\r\nThis patch resolves this issue by modifying `PropagateEmptyRelation` to consider only the presence/absence of grouping expressions, not the aggregate functions themselves, when deciding whether to propagate EmptyRelation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added end-to-end regression tests in `SQLQueryTest`'s `group-by.sql` file.\r\n- Updated unit tests in `PropagateEmptyRelationSuite`.","created_at":"2017-05-10T00:54:51Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T18:49:16Z","closed_at":"2017-05-10T06:39:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfb1350c5ef79b98fe071c0699a3577f805ba1cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17929/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17929/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17929/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fe8fe9a79f6a0228a08298c60942d6becfe20338","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:fix-PropagateEmptyRelation","ref":"fix-PropagateEmptyRelation","sha":"fe8fe9a79f6a0228a08298c60942d6becfe20338","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere's a latent corner-case bug in PySpark UDF evaluation where executing a `BatchPythonEvaluation` with a single multi-argument UDF where _at least one argument value is repeated_ will crash at execution with a confusing error.\r\n\r\nThis problem was introduced in #12057: the code there has a fast path for handling a \"batch UDF evaluation consisting of a single Python UDF\", but that branch incorrectly assumes that a single UDF won't have repeated arguments and therefore skips the code for unpacking arguments from the input row (whose schema may not necessarily match the UDF inputs due to de-duplication of repeated arguments which occurred in the JVM before sending UDF inputs to Python).\r\n\r\nThis fix here is simply to remove this special-casing: it turns out that the code in the \"multiple UDFs\" branch just so happens to work for the single-UDF case because Python treats `(x)` as equivalent to `x`, not as a single-argument tuple.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew regression test in `pyspark.python.sql.tests` module (tested and confirmed that it fails before my fix).","created_at":"2017-05-09T22:22:07Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T23:55:54Z","closed_at":"2017-05-10T23:54:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ad53e275be4bdb427415f18adf0a196fbc40022","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/17e69b5c10eeb9a6138a50985ed891ebae398619","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-20685","ref":"SPARK-20685","sha":"17e69b5c10eeb9a6138a50985ed891ebae398619","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror
