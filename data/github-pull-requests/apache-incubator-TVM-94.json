PR adds support for partitioning, compiling, and running the TensorRT BYOC target.\r\n\r\n# Building\r\n\r\nThere are two new cmake flags:\r\n* `USE_TENSORRT=ON/OFF`: enables TensorRT code generation - this does not require TensorRT libraries\r\n* `USE_TENSORRT_GRAPH_RUNTIME=ON/OFF/\"path/to/TensorRT\"`: enables TensorRT runtime - this requires TensorRT libraries. A system wide install of TensorRT from a deb package or JetPack can be detected by \"ON\", but a .tar.gz installation requires you to provide path to the extracted TensorRT archive.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nThe compilation target should be \"cuda\" to ensure that input and output args to the TensorRT functions are placed on the GPU.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Compilation\r\nfrom tvm.relay.op.contrib import tensorrt\r\nmod = tensorrt.partition_for_tensorrt(mod, params)\r\nwith relay.build_config(opt_level=3):\r\n  graph, lib, params = relay.build(mod, target=\"cuda\", params=params)\r\n# Running inference is unchanged\r\nmod = graph_runtime.create(graph, lib, ctx=tvm.gpu(0))\r\nmod.run(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# High level components\r\n\r\n## Partitioning\r\n\r\nThe annotation rules for TensorRT change depending on the version of TensorRT that is being targeted as well as the \"batching mode\". This can be configured with the `trt_version` and `use_implicit_batch` args of `partition_for_tensorrt`.\r\n\r\nIf TVM was built against the TensorRT library, the linked version is used for partitioning instead.\r\n\r\n## Codegen\r\n\r\nThis implementation using the JSONRuntime `JSONSerializer` base class for codegen to serialize the relay expression to a json format.\r\n\r\n## Runtime\r\n\r\nRuntime is handled by the runtime module class in `tensorrt_runtime.cc`. During runtime, it first uses the `TensorRTBuilder` class (`tensorrt_builder.cc`) is used to convert the json graph to a TensorRT `INetworkDefinition` using TensorRT APIs. It uses the op converter classes in `tensorrt_ops.cc` to do this. Then, the TensorRT engine is built, this process can take up to a few minutes because TensorRT will perform its optimizations at this point. The engine is cached for further inference calls.\r\n\r\nThe runtime can be compiled against many TensorRT versions thanks to if guards. It will work for TensorRT 5, 6, and 7. However, the compiled model must have been partitioned for a TensorRT version <= the version used at runtime. Otherwise, the compiled model may expect ops to be available which require a newer version of TensorRT.\r\n\r\n# Areas I'm looking for feedback and ideas\r\n\r\n1. TensorRT has parameters such as `max_workspace_size` and `use_implicit_batch` which I want the user to be able to supply in `partition_for_tensorrt`. These parameters need to be passed along to the codegen and stored in the serialized graph until runtime. `use_implicit_batch` also influences the partitioning rules. Currently, I'm using environment variables to pass these from python to the codegen in C++. I wonder if there is a better way to do this?\r\n\r\n2. I've implemented a transformation called `prune_tensorrt_subgraphs()` in `python/tvm/relay/op/contrib/tensorrt.py`. This is run after partitioning and allows me to decide whether to keep a subgraph or return it back to the typical TVM compilation path. This is needed because some subgraphs could be invalid - such as when the inputs have different batch sizes or for optimization purposes if the subgraph has no multiply-accumulates. I have also implemented a general version of this in C++, but it uses the global registry to allow each codegen target to define its own `is_invalid_subgraph` callback. In the future we can switch to the generic version if we find a better way to register the callbacks.\r\n\r\n3. The targeted tensorrt version needs to be accessed during annotation. I've put it in a global variable for now.","created_at":"2020-09-03T19:55:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-17T15:20:50Z","closed_at":"2020-10-19T23:03:07Z","merged_at":"2020-10-19T23:03:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"af8636a84314fc41134a3777c1a980435aa9663d","assignee":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

at master, if you run `cd docs && make html` without I think at least BLAS and CUDA enabled, the whole process segfaults and aborts. It looks like the reason is due to relying on a function in the function registry that isn't always registered. This PR fixes that plus removes some sys.exit() calls which were not causing errors but preventing docs from being built when CUDA wasn't enabled (and you have no GPU).\r\n\r\nUnsure how we should add a test to verify this behavior. I tried adding a script to run on ci-i386, but I'd need to expand the Python dependencies there to include sphinx + the doc building deps.

For some reason (probably a debt from the beginning) for each int list we are creating a Relay Var:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/f56bb71df9c93ba8830c5ab632352b3b2569bec9/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py#L2700-L2701\r\n\r\nAnd inside each op converter we are using `infer_shape` to recover the int list. This doesn't make any sense, so I removed Relay Var creation and that allowed me to remove many _infer_shape usage in our frontend.\r\n\r\nplease review @siju-samuel @t-vi \r\n\r\nAlso thanks to

Friends,\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of months, @electriclilies and I have been working to add more dynamic support to relay ops, to separate the dynamic implementations into a dyn namespace, and to provide a pass for converting ops back to static forms when possible.\r\n\r\nThe culmination of that work is this PR, which refactors the ONNX importer to directly create dynamic relay graphs instead of using infer_value to make them static in the importer.  Longer term, this will allow us to import dynamic models that we can't currently use.\r\n\r\nWe don't want to cause regressions for anyone, so this PR enables the dynamic_to_static pass by default in the graph runtime, we tested the PR against the ONNX model zoo https://github.com/onnx/models and fixed a number of issues in ops that apparently hadn't been tested with dynamic shapes to date.\r\n\r\nAn added benefit of this PR is that it removes a severe bottleneck in the infer_value calls. Models with lots of dynamic ops will import and compile much faster than before, Bert Squad from the ONNX model zoo imports and compiles in ~170s on master vs ~15s with this change.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not yet complete, we're working on adding  and strided slice (#6316) to remove the last infer value calls.\r\n\r\nSince we don't want to introduce regressions for anyone, I'd appreciate it if you

PR uses target class to replace almost all the raw target strings in all the codegen modules.

PR implements the Vitis-AI codegen using the BYOC flow and enables us to offload subgraphs to FPGA DPU accelerators (cloud/edge).\r\n\r\nBelow are the features added as part of this PR\r\n\r\n- Annotate the graph for the given Vitis-AI DPU (Deep Learning Processing Unit) target.\r\n- During codegen phase, convert the relay subgraph into PyXIR and save XGraph.\r\n- Vitis-AI runtime supports SaveToBinary and LoadFromBinary. We save the XGraph it in our own format and serialize it in the Module by keeping track of the path to the files.\r\n- Tests include a complete resnet18 model  test partly offloaded to PyXIR for DPU acceleration. However, we don't have access to  an FPGA  instance in the CI docker environment and therefore the offloaded subgraph is just executed on CPU. \r\n\r\nThis PR depends on following [Vitis-AI CI contribution PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/6342).\r\nThe RFC for this PR can be found from [here](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-byoc-vitis-ai-integration/7544).\r\n \r\nThis work is

the dynamic models can only be executed for on CPU. The GPU execution is not allowed for these models because they have shape functions to do runtime type inference. These functions may contain various control logic to derive the shape of a tensor at runtime and they are never compute intensive, therefore are designed to be executed on CPU. That being said, we must use CPU to execute these functions even when trying to run the whole model on other devices. This PR enables the heterogeneous execution for Relay VM to support dynamic models on devices other than CPU.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, it includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- [x] makes the memory_alloc and memory plan passes context aware when inserting vm/memory dialects.\r\n- [x] designs a union-find based context analysis pass to analyze the device context of the IR node in a relay program [Thanks @jroesch and @icemelon9 for help]\r\n- [x] implements a DeviceCopy instruction in VM to copy data directly cross different devices.\r\n- [x] enables GPU tests for various unit tests involving dynamic inputs/shape functions, namely those in test_any.py, test_adt.py, and test_vm.py, and dynamic namespace tests.\r\n- [x] tests heterogeneous execution for the static cases used for graph runtime (test_pass_annotation.py)\r\n- [x] fixes several bugs in the VM that are manifested by heterogeneous execution\r\n\r\nFollowup PRs will fix/add schedules for some ops to enable GPU execution for Bert and TF objection detection models.\r\n\r\ncc @icemelon9 @jroesch @mbrookhart @wweic

PR adds a script that automates the process of running dockerized lint scripts locally, specifically:\r\n - consulting `Jenkinsfile` to determine which docker container to use\r\n - invoking 1 or all of the lint scripts, depending on which ones need to be fixed up\r\n\r\nit also fixes the ASF check to ignore gitignore'd and untracked files locally, so that the overall process doesn't bomb out if you have an uncommitted text file in the repo.\r\n\r\na couple of design choices here:\r\n - moved the `make (cpp|py|jni)lint` steps to dedicated scripts in tests/lint\r\n - explicitly avoided adding interactive logic to `tests/scripts/task_lint.sh`--this should remain simple and readable so it's clear what the CI does\r\n - maintained existing make targets for backwards-compat with everyone's workflows\r\n - two changes likely usable for other workflow improvements:\r\n    - a script to filter untracked/gitignore'd files\r\n    - added `-i` flag to `docker/bash.sh` so that more automation can be added that supports

of the time spent in testing is duplicated work between CPU and GPU test nodes. The main reason is that there is no way to control which TVM devices are enabled at runtime, so tests that use LLVM will run on both GPU and CPU nodes.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds an environment variable, `TVM_TEST_DEVICES`, which controls which TVM devices should be used by tests. Devices not in `TVM_TEST_DEVICES` can still be used, so tests must be careful to check that the desired device is enabled with `tvm.testing.device_enabled` or by enumerating all devices with `tvm.testing.enabled_devices`. All tests have been retrofitted with these checks.\r\n\r\nThis patch also provides the decorator `@tvm.testing.gpu` to mark a test as possibly using the gpu. Tests that require the gpu can use `@tvm.testing.requires_gpu`. Tests without these flags will not be run on GPU nodes.","created_at":"2020-08-24T18:42:32Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T21:51:28Z","closed_at":"2020-09-02T21:51:00Z","merged_at":"2020-09-02T21:51:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"b235e590a66e1367c2fbadece8e4a89a263eb4b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

adds support for configuring the number of ops in one fused function. The motivation is for a use case like \r\n[hummingbird ](https://github.com/microsoft/hummingbird) where there can be unbounded number of operations fused into one function, depending on the dataset. This leads to huge compilation time. \r\n\r\nMore details explained in \r\nhttps://discuss.tvm.ai/t/aggressive-operator-fusion-and-its-consequence-of-huge-inlined-tir-expression/7687\r\n\r\nThere is already a hard coded constant kMaxFusedOps and the condition to check the number of fused ops:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/a8e44710c6472a2ee5cb66283c7f5e77f4e4ca0d/src/relay/transforms/fuse_ops.cc#L82\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/a8e44710c6472a2ee5cb66283c7f5e77f4e4ca0d/src/relay/transforms/fuse_ops.cc#L678\r\n\r\nBut this condition is simply not correct, since for a diamond structure there are multiple paths connecting a child node (`group_node` above) and its dom parent. Correctly calculating the number of fused nodes requires more care, and I believe my implementation is correct.\r\n\r\nPlease review @tqchen @zhiics

fixes the interesting typing problem raised in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/6300.\r\n\r\nIn Torchscript,  parameters of operations like conv are always accessed via `prim::GetAttr` nodes. For example, when we see \r\n\r\n```\r\n %input : Float(1, 6, 4) = aten::_convolution(%input.1, %6, %7, %9, %11, %13, %14, %16, %17, %18, %19, %20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe input weight %6 is accessed in this way:\r\n```\r\n%3 : Module = prim::GetAttr[name=\"conv\"](%self.1)\r\n%6 : Tensor = prim::GetAttr[name=\"weight\"](%3)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe problem is, Torch cannot figure out the correct type of GetAttr nodes. So when we visit `aten::_convolution` to get its input types, we have to assume that this is an untyped tensor and get annoying warnings `Untyped Tensor found, assume it is float`. \r\n\r\nThis hasn't been a big issue so far because parameters are usually float anyways. But https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/6300 brought a use case where there are integer parameters as well as float ones. Changing `default_dtype` to int doesn't solve it. \r\n\r\nSo I added a workaround  when we try to get the dtype of GetAttr nodes. For every GetAttr node there is a corresponding parameter from the original PyTorch module with known, correct dtype. And for every PyTorch parameter tensor we have a corresponding Relay Var (via `convert_params(...)` function).  So inside `_get_input_types` when we find `GetAttr` node, we return the dtype of corresponding Relay Var, instead of returning `default_type`.\r\n\r\nThis is the solution I came up with minimal change. It fixes the problem, but I feel it is a bit hacky. Please let me know if there are better ways to handle this.  The test case I added is a minimal reproduction of the issue raised in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/6300.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, there would be no more annoying warnings `Untyped Tensor found...` when working with traced models.\r\n\r\nplease review @siju-samuel @t-vi

is a follow-up PR on top of #6112, introducing `compile` subcommand on `tvmc` or `python -m tvm.driver.tvmc`\r\n * Add 'compile' subcommand into tvmc (tvm.driver.tvmc)\r\n * Add frontends: Keras, ONNX, TensorFlow, tflite, PyTorch\r\n * Add tests for the 'compile' subcommand\r\n * Add frontend dependencies on `setup.py` to make TVM python package ready-to-use on install\r\n\r\nKnown limitations:\r\n- It covers a subset of TVM supported frontends: Keras, ONNX, tflite, TensorFlow and PyTorch\r\n- It assumes graph runtime only\r\n\r\nThere are still 2 patches to be submitted: `tvmc tune` and `tvmc run`, both depending on this.\r\n\r\nIn case you want to have a look and test `compile`, you can use the `--dump-codegen ll` or  `--dump-codegen asm` or  `--dump-codegen relay` to check the output module as source.\r\n\r\nA sample usage would look like (assumes TVM is built and working):\r\n```\r\nwget https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/mobilenet_v1_2018_08_02/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tgz\r\n\r\ntar xvvzf mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tgz\r\n\r\npython -m tvm.driver.tvmc compile --target=llvm --output model.tar --dump-code relay  mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tflite\r\n\r\ncat model.relay\r\n\r\n# should output mobilenet as relay\r\n```\r\n\r\n@tqchen @comaniac @jroesch,
