It fails with \"Failed to generate the baseline file. Check the build error above.\" ([full log](https://gist.github.com/suztomo/b5a33361ad83c5e5c9054b393ac496c1)).\r\n\r\nIt's because `./gradlew ... -PjavaLinkageWriteBaseline=build/linkagecheck/baseline-beam-sdks-java-io-google-cloud-platform.xml :checkJavaLinkage` task does not generate a file. \r\n\r\n# Diagnosis\r\n\r\nBeam repository has migrated to the Gradle Kotlin DSL recently. The Kotlin Gradle DSL needs to add a spread operator when passing an array to \"args\" method.

Moved the cleanup mock for the flaky test down to the statement we\r\n   want to check instead of placing an assert_not_called before the\r\n   statement that we cannot guarantee in the testing environment.\r\n2. The culprit statement could be the `set_cache_manager` when in the\r\n   testing environment, the global singleton ie.current_env() holds a\r\n   non empty cache manager for some reason while a new cache manager\r\n   set would trigger a cleanup.\r\n3.

present, the `WriteRecords` transform for KafkaIO does not recognize the `partition` property defined on `ProducerRecord` instances consumed by the transform:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproducer.send(\r\n        // The null property in the following constructor represents partition\r\n        new ProducerRecord<>(\r\n            topicName, null, timestampMillis, record.key(), record.value(), record.headers()),\r\n        new SendCallback());\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this limitation, in a scenario where a user may desire an explicitly defined partitioning strategy as opposed to round-robin, they would have to create their own custom `DoFn` that defines a KafkaProducer (preferably within a @StartBundle) similar to the following approach (in Kotlin):\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate class ExampleProducerDoFn(...): DoFn<...>() {\r\n        private lateinit var producer: KafkaProducer<...>\r\n\r\n        @StartBundle\r\n        fun startBundle(context: StartBundleContext) {\r\n            val options = context.pipelineOptions.`as`(YourPipelineOptions::class.java)\r\n            producer = getKafkaProducer(options)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @ProcessElement\r\n        fun processElement(context: ProcessContext){\r\n            // Omitted for brevity\r\n            \r\n            // Produce the record to a specific topic at a specific partition\r\n            producer.send(ProducerRecord(\r\n                \"your_topic_here\",\r\n                your_partition_here,\r\n                context.element().kv.key,\r\n                context.element().kv.value\r\n            ))\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _initial_ pull request that I threw in here simply replaces the existing `null` with the `record.partition()` (i.e. the record that was explicitly defined initially, but it may require some other changes which I'd need someone more familiar with the KafkaIO source to chime in on.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I created [a corresponding JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11806), which any feedback would be appreciated on as well.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your

is difficult to write unit tests that use the bigtable emulator, because the cached channel pool is shared globally within a process.  This means multiple unit tests running concurrently against different emulator instances will all hit whichever test runs first.\r\n\r\nThis is admittedly a workaround to the behavior of the Bigtable client, ideally it would cache channel pools per-host, rather than globally.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fixes a breakage caused by #13884. Before #13884, when streaming was enabled, we never call `translations.optimize_pipeline` on `self.proto_pipeline`. After #13884, when streaming is enabled, we never call `translations.optimize_pipeline` on `self.proto_pipeline` with `phases=[]`. This breaks Dataflow Python streaming because calling `translations.optimize_pipeline` with `phases=[]` is not a no-opt.\r\n\r\nThis fix only calls `translations.optimize_pipeline` when the pipeline is not streaming and when phases is non-empty.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Changed how Linux system exposes worker handler endpoints to\r\n   sibling Java docker containers when executing pielines with\r\n   SqlTransforms in containerized notebook environment.\r\n2. Before the change, pipelines with external transforms cannot be\r\n   executed if the SDK is running inside a docker container.\r\n3. Even after the change, the docker container running the SDK needs to\r\n   set up Java and Docker (DooD or DinD) for xlang support.\r\n4. The change does not take effect if the SDK is not running in a\r\n   notebook(ipython) environment.\r\n5. The change also works even if the notebook environment running the\r\n   SDK is not in a docker container.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

quickstart tasks are failing due to a connection reset error from the mvn command. There are a few potential solutions to this, the first is what this PR covers:\r\n\r\n1. add retries using wagon to add resilience for transient network issues\r\n2. disable http keep alives which mvn has had trouble with in the past (was apparently fixed in an earlier maven version than our current one: 3.5.4) using `-Dmaven.wagon.http.pool=false` OR `-Dhttp.keepAlive=false`.\r\n\r\nIf this doesn't work, we can try the latter. I was unable to repro locally.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is adding S3FileSystem v2 to the amazon-web-services2 submodule, and which uses AWS SDK V2.
