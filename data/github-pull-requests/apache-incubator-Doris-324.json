Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nThis PR supports rowset level data upload on the BE side, so that there can be both cold data and hot data in a tablet, and there is no necessary to prohibit loading new data to cooled tablets.\r\n\r\nEach rowset is bound to a `FileSystem`, so that the storage layer can read and write rowsets without perceiving the underlying filesystem.\r\n\r\nThe abstracted `RemoteFileSystem` can try local caching strategies with different granularity, instead of caching segment files as before.\r\n\r\nTo avoid conflicts with the code in be/src/io, we temporarily put the file system related code in the be/src/io/fs directory. In the future, `FileReader`s and `FileWriter`s should be unified.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (Yes/No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (Yes/No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #10217 \r\n\r\nHere implements the first table valued function framework in this PR. The frameworks is as follows:\r\n- add TableValuedFunctionRef as a table ref in SQL definition.\r\n- TableValuedFunctionRef will be parsed and analyzed during analysis process, it will bind to the related TableValuedFunctionInf according to function name.\r\n- A table valued function will generate a dynamic table and scannode during plan stage. So that a TableValuedFunctionInf mainly defined two interface:\r\n- public abstract List getTableColumns()\r\n- public abstract List<TableValuedFunctionTask> getTasks();\r\n\r\nDeveloper should also implement the related ScanNode on BE.\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nIn this PR, there is a demo table valued function——numbers(). User could use select sum(number) from numbers(\"10000\"). And we could use this table function to test our vector engines performance.\r\n\r\nMySQL [(none)]> select sum(number) from (select number from numbers(\"1000\") where number < 10) as c;\r\n+---------------+\r\n| sum(number) |\r\n+---------------+\r\n| 45 |\r\n+---------------+\r\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\r\n\r\nNumbers table function is only supported under vectoried engine.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (Yes/No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (Yes/No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\nAuthentication exception when the name of database or table contains an underscore in grant statement. \r\nDoris uses regular matching strings. If the name contains underscores, it will be converted to '.' wildcard.\r\n```\r\n// org.apache.doris.common.PatternMatcher#convertMysqlPattern\r\nswitch (ch) {\r\n    case '%':\r\n        sb.append(\".*\");\r\n        break;\r\n    case '.':\r\n        sb.append(\"\\\\.\");\r\n        break;\r\n    case '_':\r\n        sb.append(\".\");\r\n        break; \r\n```\r\nIf we build a TablePrivEntry contains underscores, any other table whose name changes one character  can get the same privileges:\r\n```\r\nTablePrivEntry tablePrivEntry = TablePrivEntry.create(\r\n    \"127.%\", \"db_db1\", \"user1\", \"tbl_tbl1\", false,\r\n    PrivBitSet.of(PaloPrivilege.SELECT_PRIV, PaloPrivilege.DROP_PRIV));\r\n\r\nTablePrivTable tablePrivTable = new TablePrivTable();\r\ntablePrivTable.addEntry(tablePrivEntry, false, false);\r\nUserIdentity userIdentity = new UserIdentity(\"user1\", \"127.%\", false);\r\nuserIdentity.setIsAnalyzed();\r\n\r\nPrivBitSet privs1 = PrivBitSet.of();\r\ntablePrivTable.getPrivs(userIdentity, \"db#db1\", \"tbl#tbl1\", privs1);\r\nboolean canDrop1 = PaloPrivilege.satisfy(privs1, PrivPredicate.DROP); // canDrop1 equals true\r\n```\r\nIn grant statement, database and table support matching a single '*' wildcard, the other cases are string case-sensitive equivalent matching.\r\n\r\nFinally, fix a serious bug that won't be triggered in PrivBitSet.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (No)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (No)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-17T06:48:42Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T03:19:48Z","closed_at":"2022-06-19T14:20:02Z","merged_at":"2022-06-19T14:20:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"f728fd49330e08a2fa23e6018b4e4f8d4a4fcc9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #10189\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nPropertyAnalyzer.analyzeDataProperty(Map<String, String> properties, final DataProperty oldDataProperty) has something not suitable.\r\nParameter oldDataProperty is the old DataProperty, properties should be used to replace some of its members.\r\nIf properties has no some members, old ones need to be left, but not be set to default value.\r\nFunction modifyPartitionsProperty() uses analyzeDataProperty(), but create a new DataProperty again, it is duplicate.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (Yes/No)\r\n5.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n#9810\r\n\r\nThis pr add `VSchemaChangeDirectly`/`VSchemaChangeWithSorting` to replace `SchemaChangeDirectly`/`SchemaChangeWithSorting`.\r\n\r\nAnd add `MultiBlockMerger` to sort and merge multi block (maybe we can try to build a big block to replace multi-blcok, waiting for investigation)\r\n\r\nWe can set `enable_vectorized_alter_table` to `true` to enable vectorized `schema-change`, but because `schema-change`, `materialized view`, and `rollup` share the logic of alter table, so now `materialized view` and `rollup` may fail because fe does not pass a correct usable expr or `RowBlockChanger::change_block` does not do specific support.\r\n.\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nDescribe the overview of changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/10182\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter the first intersect operator, the hash table will be filled with matched and unmatched values. before doing the next intersect operation( assume there is one ), the hash table will be sweept in two ways:\r\n1. if there is less than 1/4 cells are matched, the table would be shrinked by inserting the matched values into a new hash table and then deleting the old one\r\n2. mark all unmached values as ZERO value to ensure these ZERO values can't be matched in the next intersect operation.\r\n\r\nin case 2, there is a problem:\r\nThe original code iterate over all the hash table values, and set the unmatched ones to ZERO. But the iterator's operator++() method always check if the current value is ZERO. If it does, the iterator will be moved to the head of the container, and move forword step by step to find the next value( first NO-ZERO value ). So if changes the current value to ZERO before calling iterator's operator++ method, the iterator would always be moved to the head instead of move to the next value as we expected. So the code should be changed to move the iterator to next value, then set the unmatched cell to ZERO.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (No)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (No)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (No)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-16T05:27:25Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T04:12:38Z","closed_at":"2022-06-17T00:43:54Z","merged_at":"2022-06-17T00:43:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"1cca319d18385c5c3ba413af5507d240fe771d95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nTABLESAMPLE allows you to limit the number of rows from a table in the FROM clause.\r\n\r\nUsed for data detection, quick verification of the accuracy of SQL, table statistics collection.\r\n\r\n### Grammar\r\n```\r\n[TABLET tids] TABLESAMPLE n [ROWS | PERCENT] [REPEATABLE seek]\r\n```\r\n\r\nLimit the number of rows read from the table in the FROM clause, \r\nselect a number of Tablets pseudo-randomly from the table according to the specified number of rows or percentages, \r\nand specify the number of seeds in REPEATABLE to return the selected samples again. \r\nIn addition, can also manually specify the TableID, \r\nNote that this can only be used for OLAP tables.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nQ1:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 TABLET(10001,10002) limit 1000;\r\n```\r\nexplain:\r\n```\r\npartitions=1/1, tablets=2/12, tabletList=10001,10002\r\n```\r\nSelect the specified tabletID of the t1.\r\n\r\nQ2:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 TABLESAMPLE(1000000 ROWS) REPEATABLE 1 limit 1000;\r\n```\r\nexplain:\r\n```\r\npartitions=1/1, tablets=3/12, tabletList=10001,10002,10003\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ3:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 TABLESAMPLE(1000000 ROWS) REPEATABLE 2 limit 1000;\r\n```\r\nexplain:\r\n```\r\npartitions=1/1, tablets=3/12, tabletList=10002,10003,10004\r\n```\r\n\r\nPseudo-randomly sample 1000 rows in t1.\r\nNote that several Tablets are actually selected according to the statistics of the table, \r\nand the total number of selected Tablet rows may be greater than 1000, \r\nso if you want to explicitly return 1000 rows, you need to add Limit.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\nFirst, determine how many rows to sample from each partition according to the number of partitions.\r\nThen determine the number of Tablets to be selected for each partition according to the average number of rows of Tablet,\r\nIf seek is not specified, the specified number of Tablets are pseudo-randomly selected from each partition.\r\nIf seek is specified, it will be selected sequentially from the seek tablet of the partition.\r\nAnd add the manually specified Tablet id to the selected Tablet.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (Yes/No)\r\n5.
