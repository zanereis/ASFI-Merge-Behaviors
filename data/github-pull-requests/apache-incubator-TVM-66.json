PR is part of the stage M3c of the meta schedule project (#8473).\r\n\r\nThe architecture is re-designed by Junru and Xiyou. Here we introduce the `ScheduleRule` class to process tir blocks while generating new design spaces via `PostOrderApply` space generator. The post-order-apply space generator collects all the blocks in IRModule and apply the rules in post order. Here we also allow custmization of schedule rules using a python side class `PyScheduleRule`. Note that we introduced method definition check `check_override` to make sure certain methods are overrided so that an error will be thown upon definition of an incomplete PyClass.\r\n\r\nUnittests are also introduced in this PR.

`@script` shape function for `copy` was ill-formed, resulting in a TIR shape\r\nfunction which did not assign to its output.

`Optional` don't have its own `get()` implementation, so if we want to get the internal container pointer of an optional object `o` with type `Optional<T>`, we can either use `o.value().get()` (in the case it's defined) or `static_cast<const T*>(o.get())` (because the inherited `get()` function has no type information). Neither of them are satisfactory if we want to get a pointer with type `const T*`.\r\n\r\nThis PR overloads the `get()` function of `Optional`, which returns `nullptr` when the object is not defined,

So if we look at the partitioned subgraph of resnet50, for example, the `main` function looks like this (see the whole model at https://github.com/masahi/tvm-cutlass-eval/blob/master/resnet50/resnet50_partition.txt):\r\n```\r\n  ...\r\n  %4 = @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_3(%3, meta[relay.Constant][2] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 1, 1, 64), float16] */, meta[relay.Constant][3] /* ty=Tensor[(64), float16] */) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 64), float16] */;\r\n  %5 = @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_6(%4, meta[relay.Constant][4] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 3, 3, 64), float16] */, meta[relay.Constant][5] /* ty=Tensor[(64), float16] */) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 64), float16] */;\r\n  %6 = @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_9(%5, meta[relay.Constant][6] /* ty=Tensor[(256, 1, 1, 64), float16] */, meta[relay.Constant][7] /* ty=Tensor[(256), float16] */) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 256), float16] */;\r\n  %7 = @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_12(%3, meta[relay.Constant][8] /* ty=Tensor[(256, 1, 1, 64), float16] */, meta[relay.Constant][9] /* ty=Tensor[(256), float16] */) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 256), float16] */;\r\n  %8 = add(%6, %7) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 256), float16] */;\r\n  %9 = nn.relu(%8) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 256), float16] */;\r\n  %10 = @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_15(%9, meta[relay.Constant][10] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 1, 1, 256), float16] */, meta[relay.Constant][11] /* ty=Tensor[(64), float16] */) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 64), float16] */;\r\n  %11 = @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_18(%10, meta[relay.Constant][12] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 3, 3, 64), float16] */, meta[relay.Constant][13] /* ty=Tensor[(64), float16] */) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 64), float16] */;\r\n  %12 = @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_21(%11, meta[relay.Constant][14] /* ty=Tensor[(256, 1, 1, 64), float16] */, meta[relay.Constant][15] /* ty=Tensor[(256), float16] */) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 256), float16] */;\r\n  %13 = add(%12, %9) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 256), float16] */;\r\n  %14 = nn.relu(%13) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 56, 56, 256), float16] */;\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe intermediate `add`s are the element-wise addition in the residual block, which can in principle be fused with the preceding conv2d. [nvprof output](https://github.com/masahi/tvm-cutlass-eval/blob/master/resnet50/nvprof_cutlass_fused.txt#L47-L57) shows that these unfused ops are taking more than 20% of e2e time. If we fuse them, I believe we could approach TRT-level performance.\r\n\r\n- Despite its suboptimality, enabling activation fusion still results in a good speedup.\r\n- Cutlass results are always better than cuDNN ones, even if fusion is disabled. The difference is especially large for `deeplabv3` and `efficientnetv2`, both of which use a lot of depthwise conv2d. The nvprof output shows that cuDNN is spending a lot of time doing layout transform (see [for example](https://github.com/masahi/tvm-cutlass-eval/blob/master/effnetv2/nvprof_cudnn.txt#L52)). Maybe our use of cuDNN is not optimal in terms of API usage and kernel selections. nvprof dumps for cuDNN-runs are available in the repository, if someone wants to compare against cutlass nvprof dumps.\r\n- Fusing sigmoid activation into cutlass conv2d results in worse runtime (see `efficientnet_v2` row), which I found odd since TVM should be generating essentially the same sigmoid kernel in the unfused case. The `fast-math` option, discussed in https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/pull/378#issuecomment-992143861, makes it a lot better at the cost of slight accuracy loss. \r\n- `efficientnetv2` and `deeplabv3` use a lot of depthwise conv2d, which is not currently offloaded to cutlass. They are actually the bottleneck in the results above, which can be observed by looking at nvprof dumps. Using AutoTVM for them should help bring down e2e time further. \r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n- Kernel profiling time is extremely slow. For DETR-R50, I had to wait like 20 min. More discussion in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9737#issuecomment-993909962\r\n- ~~Trying to fuse `silu` activation in YOLOv5l results in a strange type inference error during `MergeComposite`. So the YOLOv5l result above doesn't use silu fusion.~~ (Fixed a bug in type relation)\r\n- I also tried MaskRCNN, but currently it results in a strange output (no detection) when cutlass BYOC is used. The same issue also applies to cuDNN offload, but TVM-native kernels (`target = \"cuda\"`) work correctly.

a dedicated profiler for conv2d. The source template is modified from the cutlass example in https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/master/examples/16_ampere_tensorop_conv2dfprop\r\n\r\nThe table below shows selected kernels and their runtime on resnet50 workload, using TVM's profiler I added and cutlass's `cutlass_profiler`. Scripts I used to get those numbers are available at https://github.com/masahi/tvm-cutlass-eval/tree/master/conv2d.\r\n\r\nThe reported runtimes mostly agree between two profilers. One major issue I'm aware of is that our profiler is **much** slower than the cutlass one: While `cutlass_profiler` takes only 4 min to generate all numbers below, the TVM profiler using [this script](https://github.com/masahi/tvm-cutlass-eval/blob/master/conv2d/test_resnet_workload.py)  took 40 min!! I don't see an obvious cause of slowdown in our profiler source at `contrib/cutlass/conv2d_profiler.py`, but I haven't investigated deeply yet.\r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @Laurawly \r\n\r\nworkload | TVM

PR adds a faster type inference pass which specifically is designed for the Automatic Mixed Precision Pass (AMP). The issue with AMP pass is it uses the existing type inference infrastructure extensively but existing type inference is not designed for the AMP workload.\r\n\r\nAMP works by topologically going through the expression graph, replacing nodes with casted versions and using type inference extensively to do this. However, in order to use the type inference we must, for every subgraph build an IRModule and run type inference. The current type inference ignores previously populated type information and essentially repopulates the type fields of the subgraph we are examining. In a situation with N nodes arranged in a linear fashion, for AMP pass we will have N subgraphs we examine. For the `i`-th subgraph we have `i` nodes which IRModule and type inference will touch. This essentially means we have O(N^2) runtime at least which is bad.\r\n\r\nThe key issues are therefore:\r\n1. Type inference needs an IRModule which touches all nodes in a graph\r\n2. Type inference looks at all nodes in a graph and does not reuse information\r\n\r\nThe solution I came up with is a bit of a hack that let's me avoid rewriting the Type Inference pass (which is super essential and would take a long time to change). Essentially given an expression graph with partially populated type information, we can, given a subgraph, very easily construct an analogous graph which has the same type; we just need to replace nodes with known type information with a constant or variable expression. Doing this means if we are only interested in the type of a single node, we can extract a smaller subgraph with all the needed information to infer type. We then build an IRModule and run standard type inference on this much smaller subgraph.\r\n\r\nThis has 100x reduction in the AMP pass runtime. arcfaceresnet100 on a 2020 m1 macbook pro went from 20s

removes the barrier wait between test and integration tests in CI. This will increase capacity requirements and usage but, assuming we can meet that with autoscaler, should reduce CI times by an hour or two since we're doing all the testing in parallel.\r\n    \r\nThe slow path is CPU unit test -> GPU frontend tests, so kicking off the GPU frontend tests faster should help decrease CI runtime. The CPU build was also running a bunch of unit tests, this breaks them out into their own job so the CPU build step shouldn't block the rest of CI as long.

is an implementation of [RFC#0039](https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/39), which adds layout transformations to both flat and non-flat memory buffers.\r\n\r\nThe commits in this PR are split into 4 sub-sections.  Subsection 1 is a refactor that should maintain all existing functionality, while enabling the feature additions in later subsections.  Subsections 2-4 are feature additions, each of which starts with a commit adding unit tests for that feature.\r\n\r\n1. Replacing Load/Store nodes with BufferLoad/BufferStore nodes throughout the entire lowering flow.  Access into flat memory regions, previously represented by Load/Store nodes, are now represented by BufferLoad/BufferStore nodes that access a 1-d memory space.\r\n2. Implement `.transform_layout()`, a scheduling step in TE that alters the in-memory layout of a buffer.\r\n3. Add `te.AXIS_SEPARATOR` to `.transform_layout()` to define groups of transformed axes, where each group is flattened to a single axis.  These non-flat memory regions are represented by N-d buffer objects, as enabled in step 1.\r\n4. Expose the transformed axes as the return value of `.transform_layout()`, similar to the existing `.fuse()` and `.split()` functions, to allow additional manipulation by the user.\r\n\r\nThe commits are organized internally by `git merge --no-ff` commits for each sub-section.  Unfortunately, it looks like those don't show up very cleanly in github's linear list of commits, but can be seen with `git log --graph --format=format:'%h - %s %d'`, the output of which is below.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Output of <code>git log --graph --format=format:'%h - %s %d'</code></summary>\r\n<pre><code>\r\n*   e017a87c5 - Breakpoint, expose the transformed axes for use in TE scheduling.

Add a common span filling feature for tf1/2, tflite and pytorch.\r\n* Add test cases for Span filling in each frontend.\r\n* Expose Tuple and TupleGetItem span to python end\r\n\r\nHi community,\r\n\r\nHere is a pull request about span filling for frontends -> relay\r\n(frontedns: TF 1 and 2, tfltie and pytorch)\r\nThis feature could help users to track the conversion more precisely\r\nI would like to descript more about how it works and current status below. :D\r\n\r\n1. One to many conversion\r\nFirst, though there is a set_span function for tensorflow and tensorflow2, some spans are still missing from time to time.\r\nOne of the reasons is that an op conversion might be an one to many conversion.\r\nIn this situation the intermediate ops result in empty string.\r\nTake the [pack](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/2b35cfd6ddb73afecd3f550f33881e1fdc7c3267/python/tvm/relay/frontend/tensorflow_ops.py#L1535) conversion for example, there are several expand_dims ops might be added before concatenate.\r\nVia adding a ExprMutator to traverse expression each time after an op is converted, we should get a full span tagged RelayIR.\r\n\r\nHere gives a simple example:\r\nBefore modification, the test case in this patch (tensorflow/test_forward.py:320) is converted to the following Relay expressions\r\n\r\n> def @main(%input: Tensor[(?, ?, 3, 1), float32]) {\r\n>   %113 = shape_of(%input, dtype=\"int32\") /* Shape */;\r\n>   %114 = strided_slice(%113, begin=[0], end=[1], strides=[1], axes=None);\r\n>   %115 = squeeze(%114) /* strided_slice */;\r\n>   %116 = expand_dims(%115, axis=0);\r\n>   %117 = expand_dims(3, axis=0);\r\n>   %118 = expand_dims(3, axis=0);\r\n>   %119 = (%116, %117, %118);\r\n>   %120 = concatenate(%119) /* stack */;\r\n>   dyn.reshape(%input, %120, newshape=[]) /* output */\r\n> }\r\n\r\nWith this patch we can obtain the following format.\r\n\r\n> def @main (%input: Tensor[(?, ?, 3, 1), float32]) {\r\n>   %0 = shape_of(%input, dtype=\"int32\") /* Shape */;\r\n>   %1 = strided_slice(%0, begin=[0], end=[1], strides=[1], axes=None) /* strided_slice_PART_0 */;\r\n>   %2 = squeeze(%1) /* strided_slice */;\r\n>   %3 = expand_dims(%2, axis=0) /* stack_PART_0 */;\r\n>   %4 = expand_dims(3, axis=0) /* stack_PART_1 */;\r\n>   %5 = expand_dims(3, axis=0) /* stack_PART_2 */;\r\n>   %6 = (%3, %4, %5) /* stack_PART_3 */;\r\n>   %7 = concatenate(%6) /* stack */;\r\n>   dyn.reshape(%input, %7, newshape=[]) /* output */\r\n> }\r\n\r\n(Thanks to @lixiaoquan's advice, keeping the span without suffix in the same position  seems better :D)\r\n\r\n2. span naming for each frontend\r\n  2.1. TensorFlow (1 and 2) naming: is kept the same.\r\n  2.2. tflite naming: is a combination of its op position index and output tensor name(s).\r\n      op position is good enough to map back the tflite.\r\n      And the output tensor name should be helpful when user search the op in Netron\r\n  2.3. Pytorch naming: Because PyTorch provides two kinds of graph, jit._trace.TopLevelTracedModule, and _C.Graph, two key attributes, kind() and scopeName() are recorded in a span.\r\n      scopeName(), is used to map a Realy expression back to its original pytorch module part in jit._trace.TopLevelTracedModule, and _C.Graph.\r\n      Combined with kind(), the position of node can be precisely located in _C.Graph.\r\n\r\n3. Limitation\r\n  3.1. Few model in test_functional_models.py is still in investigation.\r\n  3.2. [In the end of tflie conversion](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/af869bc79cecdc18371862524ea241803dc78c7a/python/tvm/relay/frontend/tflite.py#L3763), a Tuple expression is added if output  more than 1. This tuple will not have any span.\r\n  3.2 Note that some conversion, like aten::to in Pytorch might result in a python-built-in float instance. its node information will be drop simply.\r\n\r\n4. Trivial\r\n   Several test cases are attached. Should be a quick verifier for reviewing.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading. Any comment is appreciated. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

discussed in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/byoc-cutlass-dealing-with-constants-in-c-source-gen-based-byoc/11362, constant binding in C-source based BYOC is a common problem. So far, I've been avoiding this problem by **not** running `bind_params` and `FoldConstant` before partitioning. However, to convert `conv2d -> batch_norm -> relu` into `conv2d -> bias_add -> relu`, constant folding is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis PR is my proposal to allow batch norm fusion while avoiding constants binding. The change is simple and works perfectly for my use case.\r\n\r\nBefore `PartitionGraph`:\r\n```\r\n  %26 = annotation.compiler_begin(%input0, compiler=\"cutlass\") /* ty=Tensor[(8, 3, 224, 224), float32] */;\r\n  %27 = annotation.compiler_begin(meta[relay.Constant][0] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 3, 7, 7), float32] */, compiler=\"cutlass\") /* ty=Tensor[(64, 3, 7, 7), float32] */;\r\n  %28 = annotation.compiler_begin(meta[relay.Constant][1] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 1, 1), float32] */, compiler=\"cutlass\") /* ty=Tensor[(64, 1, 1), float32] */;\r\n  %29 = fn (%FunctionVar_8_01: Tensor[(8, 3, 224, 224), float32], %FunctionVar_8_11: Tensor[(64, 3, 7, 7), float32], %FunctionVar_8_21: Tensor[(64, 1, 1), float32], PartitionedFromPattern=\"nn.conv2d_add_nn.relu_\", Composite=\"cutlass.conv2d_bias_relu\") -> Tensor[(8, 64, 112, 112), float32] {\r\n    ...\r\n  };\r\n  %30 = %29(%26, %27, %28) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 64, 112, 112), float32] */;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter  `PartitionGraph` with `bind_constants = False`:\r\n```\r\ndef @main(%input0: Tensor[(8, 3, 224, 224), float32]) -> Tensor[(8, 1000), float32] {\r\n  %0 = @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_0(%input0, meta[relay.Constant][0] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 3, 7, 7), float32] */, meta[relay.Constant][1] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 1, 1), float32] */) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 64, 112, 112), float32] */;\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef @tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_0(%cutlass_0_i0: Tensor[(8, 3, 224, 224), float32], %cutlass_0_i1: Tensor[(64, 3, 7, 7), float32], %cutlass_0_i2: Tensor[(64, 1, 1), float32], Inline=1, Compiler=\"cutlass\", global_symbol=\"tvmgen_default_cutlass_main_0\", Primitive=1) -> Tensor[(8, 64, 112, 112), float32] {\r\n  %43 = fn (%FunctionVar_8_0: Tensor[(8, 3, 224, 224), float32], %FunctionVar_8_1: Tensor[(64, 3, 7, 7), float32], %FunctionVar_8_2: Tensor[(64, 1, 1), float32], PartitionedFromPattern=\"nn.conv2d_add_nn.relu_\", Composite=\"cutlass.conv2d_bias_relu\") -> Tensor[(8, 64, 112, 112), float32] {\r\n     ...\r\n  };\r\n  %43(%cutlass_0_i0, %cutlass_0_i1, %cutlass_0_i2) /* ty=Tensor[(8, 64, 112, 112), float32] */\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @zhiics @comaniac

At this time, current is changed.\r\n\r\nI think the reason for this bug is that the reset_global_scope function is a shallow copy of GLOBAL_SCOPE, and the problem is solved after replacing it with a deep copy.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

there. The PR originate from the issue detected in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9527, where a tiled block with both lowerbound and upperbound predicates fail to infer the `region_cover` property. Some tracing show that the `DetectIterMap` fail on such cases.\r\n```python\r\nfor hh_0, ww_0 in T.grid(28, 28):\r\n    for ax0, ax1 in T.grid(10, 10):\r\n        with T.block(\"cache\"):\r\n            h = T.axis.spatial(224, hh_0 * 8 - 1 + ax0)\r\n            w = T.axis.spatial(224, ww_0 * 8 - 1 + ax1)\r\n            T.where(1 <= hh_0 * 8 + ax0 and hh_0 * 8 + ax0 < 225 and 1 <= ww_0 * 8 + ax1 and ww_0 * 8 + ax1 < 225)\r\n            cache[h, w] = X[h, w]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe PR modify affine utility in aspects below :\r\n- Free vars\r\n  For `DetectIterMap`, if the expression do not contain vars in domain map, it should be safe to not analyze affine form into it. eg,  `x*x + 8y + z` could pass affine analysis if `x` is not an var of iter domains. We can just put `x*x` into base part of IterSumExpr. It benefit the above case since `hh_0 * 8 + ax0` is not an affine form, but outer var might be free in certain analysis procedures.\r\n\r\n- Add `min` field to `IterMark` class\r\n  It is zero almost all time. But when lowerbound predicate exists, it seems much hard to represent the lowerbound with only source and extent.\r\n\r\n- More flexible predicate support\r\n  Support resolve all kinds of >, >=, <, <= integer comparisions, for the expr of form like `i * 8 < 10 - j`, try refactor the expr into domain var related part and domain var free parts. \r\n\r\n- Introduce `DiagnosticContext` for debug purpose\r\n  Replace each fail point (`++unresolved_cnt_`) with an error message recorded into diagnostic context. Or else it would be too hard to detect what happend for beginners. However, I do not find a proper point to call `Render()` of diagnostics for now.","created_at":"2021-12-10T07:21:57Z","updated_at":"2021-12-25T04:13:35Z","closed_at":"2021-12-25T04:13:09Z","merged_at":"2021-12-25T04:13:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"e2dcba2fde4f129c04bef6ab6310c74ba05f2a36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"http

Introduce \"check\" functions for merge composite to reject invalid input layout and dtype.\r\n* Fix GEMM kernel selection for cases where `N, K` dimensions are not divisible by 8, 4 etc, i.e. `align = 1` is mandatory. This came up in MaskRCNN where there is a workload `(M, N, K) = (?, 91, 1024)`. Since the output shape is `(?, 91)`, we cannot do vectorized memory access on the output tensor. Hence, only `align = 1` variants are valid candidates. The same fix also enabled offloading conv2d with `IC = 3` case.\r\n* On dynamic workload, since the input size can be anything, only `align = 1` variants are valid candidates. \r\n* Fixed im2col encoding of `conv2d` (see the change in `gen_conv2d.py `). But this code will be removed soon anyway when I introduce the dedicated conv2d profiler and kernel selection.\r\n\r\nSince we need to use `align = 1` kernels for cases above and CUTLASS sm80 gemm kernels do not seem to support `align=1`, I had to add sm75 kernels to sm80 kernel selection (see the change in `gen_tensor_op.py`). It turned out sm75 kernels are faster than sm80 on RTX 3070 on some workloads, so mixing sm75 and 80 seems to be a good idea.\r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @Laurawly

is in support of #9613, which allows PlanDevices to be run\r\nafter lowering so as to flow memory constraints in and\r\nout of PrimFuncs. That requires a way to insert device_copies\r\nwhen the memory scopes chosen during separate lowering of fused\r\nprimitive functions clashes, but otherwise avoid device_copies when\r\nscopes can be chosen so as to avoid them.\r\n\r\nWe support that by generalizing the \"on_device\" annotation to\r\nallow the device constraint to be independently controlled for\r\nits 'body' and 'result'.\r\n\r\n- Standard user annotation: body is constrained to S\r\n```\r\non_device(body, S)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Used by PlanDevices to 'fix' expression to S\r\n (was

is in support of #9613 which allows memory scopes to flow\r\nout of already-lowered PrimFuncs into the rest of the Relay\r\nprogram. This means scope choices made during lowering can\r\nbe accounted for in the rest of the program, with device_copies\r\ninserted as required.\r\n\r\nSomewhat more speculatively we also allow memory scopes to flow\r\nin to PrimFuncs. This is in preparation for when we can split\r\nlowering into two phases: i) lower \"primitive\" fused Relay\r\nfunctions to TensorIR in a schedulable form roughly isomorphic\r\nto TE, and ii) actual scheduling down to traditional TIR. Once\r\nthat split is made it will be possible to flow memory scopes\r\nout of one PrimFunc and into another so as to avoid unnecessary\r\ndevice_copies due to arbitrary independently chosen memory

an action (build, test, or release) is always required by\r\nbase-tool-box.py currently actions are not set as \"required\" in the\r\nparser, hence it doesn't complain when an action is missing and later\r\nwhen 'args.platform' attribute (present in all actions) is referenced\r\nthe tool exits abruptly due to an AttributeError (because 'platform' is\r\nnot set), without giving any clue on what went wrong. For instance:\r\n\r\n$ python3 ./base-box-tool.py --provider virtualbox # no action is given\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes it by setting action subparsers as required so the\r\nparser complains when no action is specified.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

PR intends to improve the printing of three kinds of syntax sugar introduced in TVMScript from #9492, #9620 and #9634. Examples below are supposedly the output of `print(some_tir_prim_func.script())`.\r\n\r\n1. For reads & writes:\r\n\r\nBefore this PR\r\n```\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(a: T.handle, b: T.handle, c: T.handle) -> None:\r\n            ...\r\n            T.reads([C[vi, vj], A[vi, vk], B[vj, vk]])\r\n            T.writes([C[vi, vj], A[vi, vk]])\r\n            ...\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR, note that brackets are removed\r\n```\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(a: T.handle, b: T.handle, c: T.handle) -> None:\r\n            ...\r\n            T.reads(C[vi, vj], A[vi, vk], B[vj, vk])\r\n            T.writes(C[vi, vj], A[vi, vk])\r\n            ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. For loops:\r\n\r\nBefore this PR\r\n```\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(a: T.handle) -> None:\r\n    ...\r\n    for i in T.serial(0, 128):\r\n        for j in T.parallel(0, 128):\r\n            for k in T.vectorized(0, 128):\r\n                for x in T.unroll(0, 128):\r\n                    for y in T.thread_binding(0, 128, thread=\"threadIdx.x\"):\r\n                        ...\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR, note that all loops with 0 as min will be printed out as syntax sugar\r\n```\r\n    ...\r\n    for i in T.serial(128):\r\n        for j in T.parallel(128):\r\n            for k in T.vectorized(128):\r\n                for x in T.unroll(128):\r\n                    for y in T.thread_binding(128, thread=\"threadIdx.x\"):\r\n                        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. For T.match_buffer():\r\n\r\nBefore this PR\r\n```\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef elementwise(\r\n    a: T.handle,\r\n    b: T.handle,\r\n) -> None:\r\n    A = T.match_buffer(a, (128, 128, 128, 128))\r\n    B = T.match_buffer(b, (128, 128, 128, 128))\r\n    # some computation\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR, note that we assume T.match_buffer with two or less arguments specified are syntax-sugarred.\r\n```\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef elementwise(\r\n    a: T.Buffer[[128, 128, 128, 128], \"float32\"],\r\n    b:T.Buffer[[128, 128, 128, 128], \"float32\"],\r\n) -> None:\r\n    # some

the logic for finding `config.cmake` in `CMakeLists.txt` looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(EXISTS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/config.cmake)\r\n  include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/config.cmake)\r\nelse()\r\n  if(EXISTS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/config.cmake)\r\n    include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/config.cmake)\r\n  endif()\r\nendif()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, it searches from binary dir(usually ./build), then it goes to the source directory(./) if it does not exist. However, I believe it does nothing since there is no config.cmake in the root directory\r\n\r\nWe can choose another policy from various candidates, like raising an error if not exist or ignoring to use `config.cmake`. I thought using the \"sample\" `cmake/config.cmake` is the most reasonable solution, I changed `CMakeLists.txt` to find from `./cmake` directory.\r\n\r\nIt's my first time to commit in here, please let me know if there are any issues! 😄

https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9349\r\n\r\nI was originally planning to send this change along with docker image update, but I've been pushing docker update work in favor of other higher priority tasks. Since people might start using TVM with PT 1.10 by now, I thought I'd send frontend update first. \r\n\r\nThough the change won't be tested on CI until docker update lands, I've confirmed locally that all tests passed with PT 1.10 using this change (in particular, the MaskRCNN test requires this change).
