order to better analyze steady-state performance of Kafka, this PR enables a warmup in the Producer Performance test. The warmup duration is specified as a number of records that are a subset of the total numRecords. If warmup records is greater than 0, the warmup is represented by a second Stats object which holds warmup results. Once warmup records have been exhausted, the test switches to using the existing Stats object. At end of test, if warmup was enabled, the summary of the whole test (warump + steady state) is printed followed by the summary of the steady-state portion of the test.  If no warmup is used, summary prints don't change from existing behavior.\r\nThis contribution is an original work and is licensed to the Kafka project under the Apache license\r\n\r\nTesting strategy comprises new Java unit tests added to ProducerPerformanceTests.java.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [X] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [X] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

we prepare a `ShareAcknowledgeCommitCallback` event for every `ShareAcknowledgeResponse` and send it over to the application thread.\r\nIn cases where the acknowledgement commit callback handler is not configured by the user, this event is not used in the application thread. So we can generate this event based on whether the callback was configured.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we have a new event which the application thread sends whenever the user enables or disables the commit callback handler, thereby letting the `ShareConsumeRequestManager` know if it has to send the background event or not. \r\n\r\n*Test*\r\nWe also have a unit test verifying if the `ShareConsumeRequestManager` sends back the event based on the boolean

PR allows people to symlink to e.g. /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh and when they execute the script it does not fail due to exec $(dirname $0.. when the directory of the symlink is not the same i.e. the symlink is in a separate directory so that binaries don't have to be cloned when a separate directory is used for e.g. configuration. This was raised as a bug in 2016 and was never fixed since the original proposal was not platform agnostic (MacOS vs Linux) and further proposals were heavy-handed. However, \"readlink -f\" is platform portable (across MacOS and Linux i.e. official docker container) and neatly solves the problem with symlinking to /opt/kafka/bin scripts.\r\nThis is my original work and I license this work to the project under the project's open source

the existing implementation, If an operation modifying the classic group state fails, the group reverts but the group size counter does not. This creates an inconsistency between the group size metric and the actual group size.\r\n\r\nConsidering that It will be complicated to rely on the `appendFuture` to revert the metrics upon the operation failure, this PR introduces a new implementation. A timeout task will periodically refresh the metrics based on the current `groups` soft state. The refreshing interval is hardcoded to 60 seconds. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

PR adds ability to specify a custom produce request parser. A custom produce request parser would allow to intercept all incoming messages before they get into the broker and apply broker wide logic to the messages. This could be a trace , a filter, or a transform(such as lineage).\r\nThe inline new ProduceRequest(new ProduceRequestData(new ByteBufferAccessor(buffer), version), version) was moved out of [ProduceRequest.java](https://app.slack.com/client/EAZPKTY6A/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/ProduceRequest.java) into its own class [ProduceRequestParser.java](https://app.slack.com/client/EAZPKTY6A/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/ProduceRequestParser.java), and ProduceRequest class was augmented with the dynamic loading of a specified parser class.

PR adds capability to restrict the messages in Share Fetch. The max fetch records will be an additional way to limit the number of records sent from broker to client.\r\n\r\nIn Share Fetch, with min and mx bytes, there exists 3 problems:\r\n1. The max.poll.records client config sends the max number of records defined to application but might have fetched extra becuase of higher max bytes. But the timeout for the sent records has started on the broker.\r\n2. As the application processes records as per max.poll.records, hence those number of records are sent in every acknowledgement. This causes the cache data to be tracked per offset as the batch is broken.\r\n3. The client has to sent the partial acknoledgment batch and cannot piggyback on fetch requests.\r\n\r\nTo handle the above scenario max fetch records has been added. Once this PR is merged and we define the right methodolgy then KIP will be updated to have max fetch records in share fetch RPC rather as broker config.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

implementation of auto-topic creation of internal topics for KIP-1071. It’s only a sketch, there are some parts missing, unit tests are insufficient, etc. But the draft works end-to-end, automatically creating all required internal topics for a streams application upon initialization, with smoke test integration test passing.\r\n\r\n- When initializing the topology, the client sends information about the internal topics required for the application. The key concept is that the topology description being sent to the broker is parametric in the number of partitions -- that is, the broker checks the number of partitions for the input partition, and derives the number of partitions for the internal topic. This logic is ported from the existing streams partition assignor.\r\n\r\n- The basic flow is that, upon receiving the initialize RPC, the group coordinator checks for the right ACL permissions, validates if the request is valid, then updates the topology record in the consumer offset topic, determines the right number of partitions for all internal topics and finally triggers a corresponding CreateTopic request. \r\n\r\n- Code for generating and validating internal topic configuration lives inside the group coordinator, but the actual creation of the topics is performed from within KafkaApis.\r\n\r\n- Compared to the schema in KIP-1071, I had to add copartition groups to the initialization call. Copartititon groups are not necessarily the same as subtopologies. For example, if we merge two topics, the two topics are in separate copartition groups but the same subtopology. If we join, they are in the same copartition group. So we need to model copartition groups separately in the RPC, otherwise the broker cannot derive the right topic configurations.\r\n\r\n- There is a dependency between updating the topology record in the consumer offset topic and creating the internal topics. In case of failures, one could be executed without the other. In this implementation, we update the topology record first, and then create internal topics. The topology record will be the single source of truth. If internal topic creation fails, we need to detect this inside the client. Right now, the heartbeat will respond with error if internal topics are missing. Once we merge the heartbeat and the initialization RPC, we should get the behavior that any attempt to join the group (with a topology description) will also be an attempt to create any missing internal topics.\r\n\r\n- Surprising, existing RPCs (TopicMetadata and FindCoordinator) auto-create topics asynchronously — so a create topic request is started, but the result is never checked. I followed the same route for this first version, but I intend to change this. You’d have to check the broker logs if internal topics cannot be created. We can do some validation up-front, but the final confirmation that internal topics were created comes from the response of the internal CreateTopics request, so I would like to only respond to the StreamsGroupInitialize once I have received the result of the CreateTopic RPCs.\r\n\r\n- We need some extra logic for revalidating internal topics. With this change, the set of tasks is defined by the TopicsImage in the group coordinator and the partition-parametric topology description. The group epoch needs to be bumped when either changes, we need to make sure to cache the result of validating and instantiating a topology against a current set of input topics, so that we don’t have to redo it on every heartbeat. After fail-over, we need to reconstruct this cache from the topology and subscription records in the offset topic. This is not fully implemented yet.","created_at":"2024-09-27T11:59:24Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T15:13:30Z","closed_at":"2024-10-09T15:13:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70b18054d04c1620038dc032bf27c1b5e0a25d9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

the current GitHub workflow, it has become difficult to locate Rat errors when running `check -x test`. To improve readability and make it easier to identify Rat errors, we need to include them in the workflow summary.\r\n\r\n## Key Modifications\r\n- Added a call to `rat.py` in the `build.yml` file to annotate Rat errors after the `Compile and validate` step.\r\n- Ensured that the annotation for Rat reports will execute **only when the `Compile and validate` step fails.** \r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n- Enhance the usability of the GitHub workflow, allowing developers to more easily identify and fix Rat errors.\r\n- Improve workflow efficiency by reducing the time spent manually searching for errors.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- **Please ensure that all relevant workflow tests are run before merging this PR to confirm that the new feature operates correctly.**\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-26T10:27:20Z","updated_at":"2024-10-01T13:47:07Z","closed_at":"2024-10-01T13:47:07Z","merged_at":"2024-10-01T13:47:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"06d2649e2ef941cab05f91c1101eac263836a7a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7388474305,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABuGMrwQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/build","name":"build","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Gradle

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17258\r\n\r\nSeveral Kafka log configurations in have synonyms. For example, log retention can be configured either by log.retention.ms, or by log.retention.minutes, or by log.retention.hours. There is also a faculty in Kafka to dynamically change broker configurations without restarting the broker. These dynamically set configurations are stored in the metadata log and override what is in the broker properties file.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these two features interacted poorly; there was a bug where the dynamic log configuration update code ignored synonyms. For example, if you set log.retention.minutes and then reconfigured something unrelated that triggered the LogConfig update path, the retention value that you had configured was overwritten.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was incorrect handling of synonyms. The code tried to treat the Kafka broker configuration as a bag of key/value entities rather than extracting the correct retention time (or other setting with overrides) from the KafkaConfig object.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

Major changes\r\n- Added `DefaultStatePersister` implementation. This is the entry point for callers who wish to invoke the share state RPC API.\r\n- Added `PersisterStateManager` which is used by `DefaultStatePersister` to manage and send the RPCs over the network.\r\n- Added code to `BrokerServer` and `BrokerMetadataPublisher` to instantiate the appropriate persister based on the config value for `group.share.persister.class.name`. If this is not specified, the `DefaultStatePersister` will be used. To force use of `NoOpStatePersister`, set the config to empty. This is an internal config, not to be exposed to the end user. This will be used to factory plug the appropriate persister.\r\n- Using this persister, the internal `__share_group_state` topic will come to life and will be used for persistence of share group info.\r\n- Added tests wherever applicable.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nSome artifacts of interest:\r\n**Share group state topic - __share_group_state**\r\n```\r\n➜   bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server

What\r\n- Moved share group/coordinator external interface classes to share module. \r\n\r\n### Why\r\n- A number of common DTO classes and interfaces exposed for KIP-932 and related to share group/coordinator persistence are currently housed in the `server-common` module.\r\n- Post introduction of the above classes, a new module `share` was introduced to encapsulate entities which could be required by various other modules (`group-coordinator`, `core`, `share-coordinator`),  basically external interface.\r\n- Hence, `server-common` is no longer the ideal location for external share entities and is more suited for very general code.\r\n- Therefore, in this PR we have moved the classes from `server-common` to `share` and removed the applicable package from server-common.\r\n- As a result of this refactor, some other classes in various modules were updated to reflect the package name change along with import control and `build.gradle`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNo business logic change, clean build locally.","created_at":"2024-09-24T08:40:00Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T16:08:02Z","closed_at":"2024-09-24T16:08:01Z","merged_at":"2024-09-24T16:08:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"67f966f34827c8133d16de7740675fc1f9cded5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

Kafka log configurations in have synonyms. For example, log retention can be configured either by log.retention.ms, or by log.retention.minutes, or by log.retention.hours. There is also a faculty in Kafka to dynamically change broker configurations without restarting the broker. These dynamically set configurations are stored in the metadata log and override what is in the broker properties file.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these two features interacted poorly; there was a bug where the dynamic log configuration update code ignored synonyms. For example, if you set log.retention.minutes and then reconfigured something unrelated that triggered the LogConfig update path, the retention value that you had configured was overwritten.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was incorrect handling of synonyms.

that the Kafka consumer subscription object is updated with the current partition assignment before partition revocation, so that close() method of the sink connector's has the access to current updated partition.\r\nDescription:\r\nIn scenarios where Kafka Connect Sink Tasks handle partition revocation events, it is critical to update the consumer subscription object with the current partition assignment before the revocation process begins. This will allow for better management of partition state and ensure that partition ownership is clear and accurately reflected in the consumer group.\r\nCurrent Behaviour:\r\nWhen partitions are revoked due to rebalancing, the current assignment is not explicitly updated in the consumer subscription object before revocation, leading close() being rendered to the old assignment state and it might be possible that no open is called for this.\r\nRace Conditions:\r\nAlso this leads to some very rare race conditions. Race conditions in some scenario in sink connectors: There could be race conditions leading to sometime updated values and sometime old values of the current assigned partitions in some scenarios.\r\nConsider this:\r\nSince the put call goes in a loop and we have some work in put which is using \"context.assignment\" to access the current assignment. Let's say the task is assigned [0, 1] and [2] is being added to it and [0] is being removed from this. If the call happens in this case:\r\n1. Close call partition [0].\r\n2. Put call comes with a batch of records\r\n3. Open call comes [2]\r\nIn this scenario accessing context.assignment inside put gives -> [0,1].\r\nBut if the call happens in this way:\r\n1. Close call partition [0].\r\n2. Open call comes for partition [2]\r\n3. Put call comes with a batch of records.\r\nIn this scenario accessing context.assignment inside put gives -> [1,2].\r\nThis leads to stale and inconsistent situation which leads to inconsistent behaviour for the connectors.\r\nProposed Behavior:\r\nBefore partition revocation occurs, update the consumer subscription object with the current partition assignment to ensure consistent state tracking and smoother transitions during rebalancing.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-23T17:23:29Z","updated_at":"2024-11-23T00:52:04Z","closed_at":"2024-11-23T00:52:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f061c71e4cfbe24edd8806f905b7ff7e1e7ee88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":7491388177,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABvoWDEQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/clients","name":"clients","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e33482094c9d79afe76f175442b956078136437a","head":{"label":"kumarpritam863:KAFKA-17599","ref":"KAFKA-17599","sha":"e33482094c9d79afe76f175442b956078136437a","user":{"login":"kumarpritam863","id":148938310,"node_id":"U_kgDOCOCeRg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148938310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863","html_url":"https://github.com/kumarpritam863","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":861875106,"node_id":"R_kgDOM18rog","name":"kafka","full_name":"kumarpritam863/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kumarpritam863","id":148938310,"node_id":"U_kgDOCOCeRg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148938310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863","html_url":"https://github.com/kumarpritam863","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarpritam863/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kumarpritam863/kafka","description":"Mirror
