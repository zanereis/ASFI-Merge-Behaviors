Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a new GHA job as part of the CI workflow which builds the release artifacts and verifies it.\r\n\r\nAs part of the verification step, we run the following check:\r\n* Verify tarball exists\r\n* Verify wheel exists\r\n* Verify tarball contents are correct by running the tests (tests should pass)\r\n* Verify wheel contents are correct by running the tests (tests should pass) \r\n\r\nIn addition to the CI changes, I fixed and improved `pyproject.toml` file and removed `MANIFEST.in` in favor of inclusion directives defined directly in the `pyproject.toml` file.\r\n\r\nThis was done for future proofing reasons and because I noticed that the behavior with `MANIFEST.in` file is not consistent in different environments aka builds are not fully reproducible (e.g. on CI, the contents of the tarball was different than contents of the tarball created locally).

(<code>[#1115](https://github.com/pypa/twine/issues/1115) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/twine/issues/1115&gt;</code>_)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix bug for Repository URLs with auth where the port was lost. When attempting\nto prevent printing authentication credentials in URLs provided with username\nand password, we did not properly handle the case where the URL also contains\na port (when reconstructing the URL). This is now handled and tested to\nensure no regressions.

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>\n<h2>Next release</h2>\n<h2>Mypy 1.10</h2>\n<p>We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.10 to the Python Package Index (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mypy/\">PyPI</a>). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Support TypeIs (PEP 742)</h4>\n<p>Mypy now supports <code>TypeIs</code> (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0742/\">PEP 742</a>), which allows\nfunctions to narrow the type of a value, similar to <code>isinstance()</code>. Unlike <code>TypeGuard</code>,\n<code>TypeIs</code> can narrow in both the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> branches of an if statement:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>from typing_extensions import TypeIs\n<p>def is_str(s: object) -&gt; TypeIs[str]:\nreturn isinstance(s, str)</p>\n<p>def f(o: str | int) -&gt; None:\nif is_str(o):\n# Type of o is 'str'\n...\nelse:\n# Type of o is 'int'\n...\n</code></pre></p>\n<p><code>TypeIs</code> will be added to the <code>typing</code> module in Python 3.13, but it\ncan be used on earlier Python versions by importing it from\n<code>typing_extensions</code>.</p>\n<p>This feature was contributed by Jelle Zijlstra (PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/16898\">16898</a>).</p>\n<h4>Support TypeVar Defaults (PEP 696)</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/\">PEP 696</a> adds support for type parameter defaults.\nExample:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>from typing import Generic\nfrom typing_extensions import TypeVar\n<p>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

some users with the only error being <code>assert mod not in mods</code>.

wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.1.\n* Fixed an issue that prevented the use of Python buffer protocol objects in\n  ``sign`` and ``verify`` methods on asymmetric keys.\n* Fixed an issue with incorrect keyword-argument naming with ``EllipticCurvePrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey.exchange`,\n  ``X25519PrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x25519.X25519PrivateKey.exchange`,\n  ``X448PrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x448.X448PrivateKey.exchange`,\n  and

incorrect keyword-argument naming with <code>EllipticCurvePrivateKey</code>\n:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey.sign</code>.</li>\n<li>Resolved compatibility issue with loading certain RSA public keys in\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_pem_public_key</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v42-0-0:</p>\n<p>42.0.0 - 2024-01-22</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.7.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Loading a PKCS7 with no content field using\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  or\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  will now raise a ``ValueError`` rather than return an empty list.\n* Parsing SSH certificates no longer permits malformed critical options with\n  values, as documented in the 41.0.2 release notes.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.0.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63.0, from 1.56.0.\n* We now publish both ``py37`` and ``py39`` ``abi3`` wheels. This should\n  resolve some errors relating to initializing a module multiple times per\n  process.\n* Support :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS` for\n  X.509 certificate signing requests and certificate revocation lists with the\n  keyword-only argument ``rsa_padding`` on the ``sign`` methods for\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder` and\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationListBuilder`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate signing request signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.7.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Loading a PKCS7 with no content field using\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  or\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  will now raise a ``ValueError`` rather than return an empty list.\n* Parsing SSH certificates no longer permits malformed critical options with\n  values, as documented in the 41.0.2 release notes.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.0.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63.0, from 1.56.0.\n* We now publish both ``py37`` and ``py39`` ``abi3`` wheels.

some users with the only error being <code>assert mod not in mods</code>. The issue was caused by the fact that <code>str(Path(mod))</code> and <code>mod.__file__</code> don't necessarily produce the same string, and was being erroneously used interchangably in some places in the code.</p>\n<p>This fix also broke the internal API of <code>PytestPluginManager.consider_conftest</code> by introducing a new parameter -- we mention this in case it is being used by external code, even if marked as <em>private</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>pytest 8.0.0rc1 (2023-12-30)</h2>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/changelog.html#pytest-8-0-0rc1-2023-12-30\">https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/changelog.html#pytest-8-0-0rc1-2023-12-30</a> for the rendered changelog.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<h3>Old Deprecations Are Now Errors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7363\">#7363</a>: <strong>PytestRemovedIn8Warning deprecation warnings are now errors by default.</strong></p>\n<p>Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as possible, all warnings of type <code>PytestRemovedIn8Warning</code> now generate errors instead of warning messages by default.</p>\n<p><strong>The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 8.1</strong>, so please consult the <code>deprecations</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.</p>\n<p>In the pytest <code>8.0.X</code> series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stopgap measure by adding this to your <code>pytest.ini</code> file:</p>\n<pre lang=\"ini\"><code>[pytest]\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Enhance `KubeVirtNodeDriver` Compute Driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request brings several improvements to the `create_node` method and related functions within the `KubeVirtNodeDriver` (`libcloud/compute/drivers/kubevirt.py`).\r\n\r\n**Features added to `KubeVirtNodeDriver.create_node`**:\r\n\r\n- Improved compatibility with the base `NodeDriver` class:\r\n    - Added support for the `size: NodeSize` parameter, while retaining legacy compatibility with `ex_cpu` and `ex_memory`.\r\n    - Added support for the `auth: NodeAuthSSHKey|NodeAuthPassword` parameter.\r\n- Support for deployment (`deploy_node`):\r\n    - `KubeVirtNodeDriver` now supports node deployment automatically, benefiting from the above compatibility changes.\r\n- Support for general volume (disks) types that KubeVirt supports:\r\n    - (==Breaking change==) Modified the content of the `ex_disks` parameter to align with the related [KubeVirt API](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/disks_and_volumes/), making it compatible with any volume types rather than hardcoded support for limited volume or disk types (previously only `persistentVolumeClaim` was supported).\r\n- Added support for the `ex_template` parameter, allowing users to customize the entire Kubernetes object declaring the virtual machine. This is particularly useful for:\r\n    - Supporting advanced configurations not covered by other parameters.\r\n    - Facilitating the reuse of existing virtual machine configurations.\r\n\r\n**Fixes**:\r\n\r\n- `_to_node`: Improved the logic for parsing memory, eliminating crashes on virtual machines with more than 1 GiB RAM.\r\n- `create_node`: (==Breaking change==) Renamed the parameter from `ports` to `ex_ports`.\r\n- ~~Addressed various bugs in the `create_node` method, which were eliminated during the refactor and implementation of new features.~~\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**:\r\n\r\n- `libcloud/compute/drivers/kubevirt.py`: \r\n    - Added a `KubeVirtNodeSize` function to assist in constructing `NodeSize` instances for `KubeVirtNodeDriver`.\r\n    - Introduced a `KubeVirtNodeImage` function to help construct `NodeImage` instances for `KubeVirtNodeDriver`.\r\n    - Code reorganization: Moved `DISK_TYPES` out of the `create_node` and exported it, enabling users to access a list of supported disk types.\r\n    - Updated docstrings for new features, adhering to sphinx grammar standards.\r\n- `libcloud/test/compute/test_kubevirt.py`:\r\n    - Introduced tests for the `create_node` method: This method was not tested previously.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [x]

Add resize node function for azure driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1964\r\n\r\nTo start with we have def ex_change_node_size(self, node, new_size) function in [https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/compute/drivers/ec2.py] which supports instance type change for AWS.\r\n\r\nWe need similar functionality for Azure cloud as well where we could change the vmSize for Azure cloud. This could be done by adding node_resize function at (https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/compute/drivers/azure_arm.py )\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\n\r\n1. Added `ex_resize_node` to change the azure vm instance type.\r\n2. Added equivalent test `test_resize_node` to test `ex_resize_node` \r\n\r\n### Status\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [x]

The aim has been to shift responsibility for\nmodifying the environment from the project builder to the <code>IsolatedEnv</code>\nentirely and to ensure that the builder will be initialised from an\n<code>IsolatedEnv</code> in a consistent manner.  Mutating the project builder is no\nlonger supported.\n(PR :pr:<code>537</code>)</li>\n<li><code>virtualenv</code> is no longer imported when using <code>-n</code>, for faster builds\n(PR :pr:<code>636</code>, fixes issue :issue:<code>510</code>)</li>\n<li>The SDist now contains the repository contents, including tests.

Description\r\nVMs on Azure can be launched with managed or unmanaged disks.\r\nUnmanaged disks are typically launched from specific VHDs.\r\nManaged disks are managed by Azure and they do not have a VHD\r\nassociated that we can remove (e.g., ubuntu image offered by Azure).\r\n\r\nDeleting a VM on the Azure Web console allows you to choose whether\r\nyou want to delete the OS disk as well, independently of this is\r\nmanaged or unmanaged. The original code would allow that only for\r\nunmanaged disks via the 'ex_destroy_vhd' parameter but, as said,\r\nthis is incomplete as VMs can be launched from Azure managed disks.\r\n\r\nThis change proposes to introduce a new parameter 'ex_destroy_os_disk'\r\nto delete the VM OS disk if it is a managed disk. Ideally, this\r\nparameter should default to True as (i) that is the Azure's default\r\noption and (ii) it would align with 'ex_destroy_vhd'. However, this\r\nmight pose backward compatibility issues if libcloud starts deleting\r\nmanaged OS disks by default as well. I am not sure what the libcloud\r\nmaintainers' take is in this regard but this would be my proposal.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that

Updated Linode (Akamai Connected Cloud) support (including cloud-init)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n1. cloud-init support is a new feature available in 2023.\r\n2. The main entry point (create_node) had an arrangement of non-keyword parameters that were not consistent with other libcloud drivers. This has been fixed.\r\n3. One remaining function (already available in the API) was exposed to also be consistent with other drivers.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [x]

Since we are comparing two elements, the length should be greater than 1. This is moved to the outside if. The change should be reviewed so that it captures the intended business logic.\n\n\nSponsorship and Support:\n\nThis work is done by the security researchers from OpenRefactory and is supported by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)(https://openssf.org/): Project Alpha-Omega(https://alpha-omega.dev/). Alpha-Omega is a project partnering with open source software project maintainers to systematically find new, as-yet-undiscovered vulnerabilities in open source code - and get them fixed – to improve global software supply chain security.\n\nThe bug is found by running the Intelligent Code Repair (iCR) tool by OpenRefactory and then manually triaging the results.","created_at":"2023-08-17T10:44:01Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T18:22:47Z","closed_at":"2023-09-13T19:23:11Z","merged_at":"2023-09-13T19:23:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"69b922ec49e15e20c14f25038692e3eaf4f7769e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1417970689,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDE3OTcwNjg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20common","name":"api:

pull request includes the following sphinx API docs improvements:\r\n\r\n* Move api docs generation from tox file to sphinix config. This seems to be the preferred method. It allows us to re-use the same tox target locally and on CI and it also simplifies RTD approach.\r\n* Update sphinx-apidocs options to generate separate file for each modules. This makes linking to docs for a specific module easier.\r\n* Update sphinx-apidocs options to exclude test modules from the api docs.\r\n\r\nThose changes should also drastically speed up the docs build time on ReadTheDocs (down to ~200 seconds from ~700 seconds).","created_at":"2023-08-08T20:42:37Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T21:12:55Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T21:12:54Z","merged_at":"2023-08-08T21:12:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"71163d70ed4862422347eba23ccba048912617c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1434176775,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDM0MTc2Nzc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"fc74ee","default":true,"description":""},{"id":5824684131,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAZm488AAAABWy2gYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api%20documentation","name":"api

pull request is a work in progress attempt at trying to migrate package and build metadata from setup.py to pyproject.toml.\r\n\r\nIt will take some time to polish out all the kinks to ensure produced sdist and wheel artifacts match what would have been produced by the previous setup.oy config.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, running tests directly via ``python setup.py test`` will be deprecated and removed (https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/explanation/goodpractices.html#do-not-run-via-setuptools) -  I will document that in the changelog and update the affected readme.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Verify new .tar.gz and wheel artifacts match what would be generated with setup.py in the past\r\n- [x] Update dist.sh script to utilize build package (https://github.com/pypa/build)\r\n- [x] Research potentially using hatchling instead of setuptools for the build backend (may want to avoid this for now to keep the scope of the changes smaller)\r\n- [x] Update development docs (release management section)\r\n- [ ] To reduce build artifact sizes, possibly consider excluding tests + test fixture files again (we've did that a long time ago and then changed to including tests with the distribution artifact - so the end user can run the tests on the downloaded artifact and verify the artifact is in order)","created_at":"2023-08-02T19:09:56Z","updated_at":"2023-08-06T16:50:58Z","closed_at":"2023-08-06T12:17:48Z","merged_at":"2023-08-06T12:17:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"17ea21742abc8b9bd7b762b9ca87cc40276e128c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3476485604,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAZm487PNvXk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/setupy%20metadata","name":"setupy
