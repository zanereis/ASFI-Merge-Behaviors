Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR enables SQLAppStatusListener and AppStatusListener to recover\r\nlive entities from KVStore(InMemoryStore or LevelDB). And it mainly adds\r\na method named `recoverLiveEntities()`, which does the recover work, in \r\n(SQL)AppStatusListener. And it  adds a series of `toLiveXXX()` methods for KVStore\r\nobject types, in order to convert a KVStore object into a live entity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSPARK-28594 and SPARK-28867 are both planed to do incremental replay\r\nin HistoryServer basing on snapshotting mechanism. And when a KVStore\r\nis restored from a snapshot, we need to recover those still running objects\r\n(e.g. jobs, stages, tasks) into live entities. Then, we could continue to replay\r\nwith the following events. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded tests in `AppStatusListenerSuite` and

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nthe noop reduce id used to be 0, which results a fixed index or data file name. When the nodes in your cluster has more than one disks, if one of them is broken and the fixed file name's hash code % disk number just point to it, all attempts of one task will inevitably access the broken disk, which lead to meaningless task failure or even tear down the whole job. Here we change the noop reduce id to task attempt number to produce different file name, which may try another healthy disk.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe have an HDFS/YARN cluster with about 2k~3k nodes, each node has 8T * 12 local disks for storage and shuffle. Sometimes, one or more disks get into bad status during computations. Sometimes it does cause job level failure, sometimes does.\r\n\r\nThe following picture shows one failure job caused by 4 task attempts were all delivered to the same node and failed with almost the same exception for writing the index temporary file to the same bad disk.\r\nThis is caused by two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. As we can see in the figure the data and the node have the best data locality for reading from HDFS. As the default spark.locality.wait(3s) taking effect, there is a high probability that those attempts will be scheduled to this node.\r\n2. The index file or data file name for a particular shuffle map task is fixed. It is formed by the shuffle id, the map id and the noop reduce id which is always 0. The root local dir is picked by the fixed file name's non-negative hash code % the disk number. Thus, this value is also fixed.  Even when we have 12 disks in total and only one of them is broken, if the broken one is once picked, all the following attempts of this task will inevitably pick the broken one.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8326978/65672636-f0610480-e07b-11e9-8939-1bc664ddaed7.png)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How

up from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24981 incorporating some comments from @HyukjinKwon.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n- Adding `CoGroupedData` to `pyspark/sql/__init__.py __all__` so that documentation is generated.\r\n- Added pydoc, including example, for the use case whereby the user supplies a cogrouping function including a key.\r\n- Added the boilerplate for doctests to cogroup.py.  Note that cogroup.py only contains the apply() function which has doctests disabled as per the  other Pandas Udfs.\r\n- Restricted the newly exposed RelationalGroupedDataset constructor parameters to access only by the sql package.\r\n- Some minor  formatting tweaks.\r\n\r\nThis was tested by running the appropriate unit tests.  I'm unsure as to how to check that my change will cause the documentation to be generated correctly, but it someone can describe how I can do this I'd be happy to check.","created_at":"2019-09-26T08:22:34Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T13:25:44Z","closed_at":"2019-09-30T13:25:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5777ed8d963adf3f3d65cd8d23d47ef7d7f9dd71","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25939/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25939/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25939/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4cdb2fa27d51f56808d5d929ce98310451f73550","head":{"label":"d80tb7:SPARK-27463-fixes","ref":"SPARK-27463-fixes","sha":"4cdb2fa27d51f56808d5d929ce98310451f73550","user":{"login":"d80tb7","id":5367773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjc3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5367773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7","html_url":"https://github.com/d80tb7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178736402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg3MzY0MDI=","name":"spark","full_name":"d80tb7/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"d80tb7","id":5367773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjc3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5367773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7","html_url":"https://github.com/d80tb7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/d80tb7/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch changes ReceiverSuite.\"receiver_life_cycle\" to record actual calls with timestamp in FakeReceiver/FakeReceiverSupervisor, which doesn't rely on timing of stopping and starting receiver in restarting receiver. It enables us to give enough huge timeout on verification of restart as we can verify both stopping and starting together.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe test is flaky without this patch. We increased timeout to fix flakyness of this test (15adcc8) but even with longer timeout it has been still failing intermittently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've reproduced test failure artificially via below diff:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCall fs.exists only when necessary in InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen saving a dataframe into Hadoop, spark first checks if the file exists before inspecting the SaveMode to determine if it should actually insert data. However, the pathExists variable is actually not used in the case of SaveMode.Append. In some file systems, the exists call can be expensive and hence this PR makes that call only when necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests should cover it since this doesn't change the behavior.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-25T16:13:14Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T10:46:45Z","closed_at":"2019-09-26T22:46:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b30b37defd20b8fdb8847e3393ca4764b3d169a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25928/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25928/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25928/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9edfa7b2dd951955f6dae7674e2fb5890b966dfe","head":{"label":"palantir:rr/exists-upstream","ref":"rr/exists-upstream","sha":"9edfa7b2dd951955f6dae7674e2fb5890b966dfe","user":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30919203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDkxOTIwMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"palantir/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/palantir/spark","description":"Palantir

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace function names in some expression examples by `_FUNC_`, and add a test to check that `_FUNC_` always present in all examples.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBinding of a function name to an expression is performed in `FunctionRegistry` which is single source of truth. Expression examples should avoid using function name directly because this can make the examples invalid in the future.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `SQLQuerySuite` which analyses expression example, and check presence of `_FUNC_`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-25T06:43:08Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T19:18:19Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T22:16:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87cdefe897b194042bf6362fe5cec83cab8b6973","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25924/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25924/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25924/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62eaea927a9c21e30f01056cb17efe8adf2b053b","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-func-examples","ref":"fix-func-examples","sha":"62eaea927a9c21e30f01056cb17efe8adf2b053b","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nProtected the `executorDataMap` under lock when accessing it out of 'DriverEndpoint''s methods.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nJust as the comments:\r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\n// Accessing `executorDataMap` in `DriverEndpoint.receive/receiveAndReply` doesn't need any\r\n// protection. But accessing `executorDataMap` out of `DriverEndpoint.receive/receiveAndReply`\r\n// must be protected by `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.this`. Besides, `executorDataMap` should\r\n// only be modified in `DriverEndpoint.receive/receiveAndReply` with protection by\r\n// `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.this`.\r\n\r\n`executorDataMap` is not threadsafe, it should be protected by lock when accessing it out of `DriverEndpoint`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisted

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn kubernetes, there are some naming regular expression requirements and restrictions on environment variable names, such as:\r\n\r\n- In kubernetes version release-1.7 and earlier, the naming rules of pod environment variable names should meet the requirements of regular expressions: [[A-Za-z_] [A-Za-z0-9_]*](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.7/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/validation/validation.go#L169)\r\n- In kubernetes version release-1.8 and later, the naming rules of pod environment variable names should meet the requirements of regular expressions: [[-. _ A-ZA-Z][-. _ A-ZA-Z0-9].*](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.8/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/validation/validation.go#L305)\r\n\r\nHowever, in spark on k8s mode, spark should add restrictions on environmental variable names when creating executorEnv.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we need to use regular expressions adapted to the high version of k8s to increase the restrictions on the names of environmental variables. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, the pod will not be created properly and the spark application will be suspended.\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem above, a regular validation to executorEnv is added and committed. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf no validation rules are added, the environment variable names that don't meet the requirements will cause the pod to not be created properly and the application will be suspended.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unit tests and manually run.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-24T19:09:23Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T02:01:41Z","closed_at":"2019-10-06T14:41:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b54bba6cef5306675196ed69ce949f8ede47244","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25920/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25920/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25920/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/799d87f5fb68d084c6f4e00363f2d9f89b47354f","head":{"label":"merrily01:SPARK-29233","ref":"SPARK-29233","sha":"799d87f5fb68d084c6f4e00363f2d9f89b47354f","user":{"login":"merrily01","id":15688792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Njg4Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15688792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01","html_url":"https://github.com/merrily01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":210670936,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTA2NzA5MzY=","name":"spark","full_name":"merrily01/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"merrily01","id":15688792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Njg4Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15688792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01","html_url":"https://github.com/merrily01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrily01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/merrily01/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA new optimizer strategy called `PruneHiveTablePartitions` is added, which calculates table size as the total size of pruned partitions. Thus, Spark planner can pick up `BroadcastJoin` if the size of pruned partitions is under broadcast join threshold.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a performance improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis is based on #18193, credits should go to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs I have mentioned in [SPARK-29225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29225)\r\nSpark SQL `DESC FORMATTED table_name` format have so many different point form hive's format.\r\nSince some JDBC query interaction platform like `HUE` use  Hive format to parse information form the query result.\r\nSuch as column information: \r\nHue use `DESC FORMATTED table` query to get result and parse column information by it's result format.  \r\nSpark SQL show different format, it cause problem when show result. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor better interaction with JDBC query platform like Hue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nCreate table like below:\r\n```\r\ncreate table order_partition(\r\n    id string,\r\n    name string,\r\n    num int,\r\n    order_number string, \r\n   event_time string)\r\nPARTITIONED BY(event_month string)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen call `DESC FORMATTED order_partition` .\r\n\r\nOrigin Format:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46485123/65567346-77cd4b80-df88-11e9-805f-d2ec05c6272c.png)\r\n\r\nCurrent format:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46485123/65567359-84ea3a80-df88-11e9-966d-46254af14707.png)\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\nWhen call `DESC FORMATTED table_name`\r\n\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe changes in the pull request allow a developer to provide a column within their structured streaming dataframe titled `header` and of type `map<string, string>` which when the dataframe is sinked to kafka the headers will be applied to the producer record. This can have many applications but the main reason we wanted this introduced was for tracing purposes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSometimes it is necessary to add custom headers to the kafka producer record but with the current spark-kafka sink this is not possible, these changes make it optional to add headers to the kafka records that will be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIf the user wants to apply headers in the records that will be published to kafka they can provide a new column of type `map<string, string>` with the title `header`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"topic\", \"CAST(key AS STRING)\", \"CAST(value AS STRING)\", \"map('custom-header-1', 'foo', 'custom-header-2', 'bar') as headers\")\r\n  .write\r\n  .format(\"kafka\")\r\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host1:port1,host2:port2\")\r\n  .save()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests have been added and it has been tested thoroughly on a cluster.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the remote repo used in IsolatedClientLoader from datanucleus to google mirror.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to connect the Maven repositories in IsolatedClientLoader for downloading Hive jars. The repository currently used is \"http://www.datanucleus.org/downloads/maven2\", which is [no longer maintained](http://www.datanucleus.org:15080/downloads/maven2/README.txt). This will cause downloading failure and make hive test cases flaky while Jenkins host is blocked by maven central repo.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to fix the flaky test in `SQLQueryTestSuite.sql (subquery/scalar-subquery/scalar-subquery-select.sql)`, which seems to throw NPE in executor side.\r\n\r\nBoth `rows` and `unsafeRows` in LocalTableScanExec are defined as `@transient` assuming that they're not needed in executors, but according to the error message and stack trace, at least `rows` has a path to be accessed from executors. `unsafeRows` will also throw NPE when executors access the value, as it accesses rows which would be null - this patch fixes it altogether.\r\n\r\n```\r\n22:58:15.942 ERROR org.apache.spark.executor.Executor: Exception in task 1.0 in stage 20635.0 (TID 36041)\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is a follow-up of SPARK-26848 (#23747).  In SPARK-26848, we decided to open possibility to let end users set individual timestamp per partition. But in many cases, specifying timestamp represents the intention that we would want to go back to specific timestamp and reprocess records, which should be applied to all topics and partitions.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to provide a way to set a global timestamp across partitions for a topic, so that end users can set all offsets by specific timestamp easily. \r\n\r\nThe patch doesn't provide a way to set global timestamp across topics, as it would require modification of format of `startingOffsetsByTimestamp`/`endingOffsetsByTimestamp`, which may not be intuitive to understand.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis would helps end users to set timestamp for reprocessing from specific point of time much easier. It also remedies the requirement of knowing number of partitions to set offsets.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs to verify the new feature.","created_at":"2019-09-24T07:14:49Z","updated_at":"2021-05-10T02:43:54Z","closed_at":"2020-01-11T00:06:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9047141f7891da81fbc25c8c070b1193a829d47b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28762\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Automatically read the `Main-Class` from a JAR's manifest even if the JAR isn't in the local file system (i.e. in S3 or HDFS).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen deploying a fat JAR (e.g. using `sbt-assembly`) to S3/HDFS, users might choose to include the main class for the JAR in its manifest. This change allows the user to `spark-submit` the JAR without having to specify the main class again via the `--class` argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Previously, if the primary resource is a JAR and isn't located in the local file system, it will fail with the error:\r\n```\r\n$ spark-submit s3a://nonexistent.jar\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.SparkException: Cannot load main class from JAR s3a://nonexistent.jar with URI s3a. Please specify a class through --class.\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the main class will be read from the manifest, assuming the classpath contains the appropriate JAR to read the file system.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded some tests in `core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmitSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2019-09-24T05:14:21Z","updated_at":"2019-10-17T21:39:30Z","closed_at":"2019-10-17T21:36:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa76037da8739e12283982b523684d8f8203f1aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement Factorization Machines as a ml-pipeline component\r\n1. loss function supports: logloss, mse\r\n2. optimizer: mini batch SGD\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFactorization Machines is widely used in advertising and recommendation system to estimate CTR(click-through rate).\r\nAdvertising and recommendation system usually has a lot of data, so we need Spark to estimate the CTR, and Factorization Machines are common ml model to estimate CTR.\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe propose to change the configuration of Netty server threads and chunk fetch handler threads to make sure the former is always a multiple of the latter. This change is necessary to make sure the RPC timeout issues can be fully resolved with the dedicated chunk fetch handler EventLoopGroup. SPARK-29206 has more details on the explanations behind this change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nVerified that after configuring the number of threads for both thread pools appropriately, we no longer see the RPC timeout issues when shuffle service gets really busy.\r\nA custom Spark shuffle service stress testing suite was used for this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nwhen the current catalog is session catalog, get/set the current namespace from/to the `SessionCatalog`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's super confusing that we don't have a single source of truth for the current namespace of the session catalog. It can be in `CatalogManager` or `SessionCatalog`.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should always track the current catalog/namespace in `CatalogManager`. However, there are many commands that do not support v2 catalog API. They ignore the current catalog in `CatalogManager` and blindly go to `SessionCatalog`. This means, we must keep track of the current namespace of session catalog even if the current catalog is not session catalog.\r\n\r\nThus, we can't use `CatalogManager` to track the current namespace of session catalog because it changes when the current catalog is changed. To keep single source of truth, we should only track the current namespace of session catalog in `SessionCatalog`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How

PR is an enhanced version of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25805 so I've kept the original text. The problem with the original PR can be found in comment.\r\n\r\nThis situation can happen when an external system (e.g. Oozie) generates\r\ndelegation tokens for a Spark application. The Spark driver will then run\r\nagainst secured services, have proper credentials (the tokens), but no\r\nkerberos credentials. So trying to do things that requires a kerberos\r\ncredential fails.\r\n\r\nInstead, if no kerberos credentials are detected, just skip the whole\r\ndelegation token code.\r\n\r\nTested with an application that simulates Oozie; fails before the fix,\r\npasses with the fix. Also with other DT-related tests to make sure other\r\nfunctionality keeps working.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-23T08:59:14Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T15:08:59Z","closed_at":"2019-09-24T18:12:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"480c91ececc22ce243b70c54ef3d9b9593efe4fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSee JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29089\r\nMailing List: http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DataFrameReader-bottleneck-in-DataSource-checkAndGlobPathIfNecessary-when-reading-S3-files-td27828.html\r\n\r\nWhen using DataFrameReader#csv to read many files on S3, globbing and fs.exists on DataSource#checkAndGlobPathIfNecessary becomes a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nFrom the mailing list discussions, an improvement that can be made is to parallelize the blocking FS calls:\r\n\r\n> - have SparkHadoopUtils differentiate between files returned by globStatus(), and which therefore exist, and those which it didn't glob for -it will only need to check those. \r\n> - add parallel execution to the glob and existence checks\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nVerifying/globbing files happens on the driver, and if this operations take a long time (for example against S3), then the entire cluster has to wait, potentially sitting idle. This change hopes to make this process faster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBarrierCoordinator sets up a TimerTask for a round of global sync. Currently the run method is synchronized on the created TimerTask. But to be synchronized with handleRequest, it should be synchronized on the ContextBarrierState object, not TimerTask object.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nContextBarrierState.handleRequest and TimerTask.run both access the internal status of a ContextBarrierState object. If TimerTask doesn't be synchronized on the same ContextBarrierState object, when the timer task is triggered, handleRequest still accepts new request and modify  requesters field in the ContextBarrierState object. It makes the behavior inconsistency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTest

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocument CREATE FUNCTION statement in SQL Reference Guide. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark lacks documentation on the supported SQL constructs causing\r\nconfusion among users who sometimes have to look at the code to understand the\r\nusage. This is aimed at addressing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\nThere was no documentation for this.\r\n\r\n**After.**\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch builds on top of #23762 to resolve the memory leak issue with SMJ. Specifically, when the underlying iterator from UnsafeExternalRowSorter is not fully consumed by SortMergeJoinExec, the requested memory by UnsafeExternalSorter will not be released, which leads to OOM, spill, and task failures. On top of the change introduced in #23762, this patch fixes the issue for when whole-stage codegen is enabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested against the example provided in SPARK-21492 to verify both inner join and non-inner join work when whole-stage codegen is either enabled or disabled.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt is very confusing that the default save mode is different between the internal implementation of a Data source. The reason that we had to have saveModeForDSV2 was that there was no easy way to check the existence of a Table in DataSource v2. Now, we have catalogs for that. Therefore we should be able to remove the different save modes. We also have a plan forward for `save`, where we can't really check the existence of a table, and therefore create one. That will come in a future PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause it is confusing that the internal implementation of a data source (which is generally non-obvious to users) decides which default save mode is used within Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt changes the default save mode for V2 Tables in the DataFrameWriter APIs\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

This PR adds support fo rpythona s well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nyes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually running different scenarios and via examining the driver & executors logs. Also there is an integration test added.\r\nI verified that the python resources are added to the spark file server and they are named properly so they dont fail the executors. Note here that as previously the following will not work:\r\nprimary resource `A.py`: uses a closure defined in submited pyfile `B.py`, context.py only adds to the pythonpath files with certain

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn our PROD env, we have a pure Spark cluster, I think this is also pretty common, where computation is separated from storage layer. In such deploy mode, data locality is never reachable.\r\nAnd there are some configurations in Spark scheduler to reduce waiting time for data locality(e.g. \"spark.locality.wait\"). While, problem is that, in listing file phase, the location informations of all the files, with all the blocks inside each file, are all fetched from the distributed file system. Actually, in a PROD environment, a table can be so huge that even fetching all these location informations need take tens of seconds.\r\nTo improve such scenario, Spark need provide an option, where data locality can be totally ignored, all we need in the listing file phase are the files locations, without any block location informations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAnd we made a benchmark in our PROD env, after ignore the block locations, we got a pretty huge improvement. \r\n\r\nTable Size | Total File Number | Total Block Number | List File Duration(With Block Location) |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25838 and proposes to create an actual test case under `src/test`. Previously, compile only test existed at `src/main`.\r\n\r\nAlso, just changed the wordings in `SerializableConfiguration` just only to describe what it does (remove other words).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTests codes should better exist in `src/test` not `src/main`. Also, it should better test a basic functionality.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo except minor doc change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test was added.","created_at":"2019-09-20T10:28:04Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:57Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T15:52:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9924fdf22ac142af61878e80e75fc825957faae4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29ae7b01c645b87e02dd12b0e85c462f975503af","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-29158","ref":"SPARK-29158","sha":"29ae7b01c645b87e02dd12b0e85c462f975503af","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change behavior of the `date_part()` function in handling `null` field, and make it the same as PostgreSQL has. If `field` parameter is `null`, the function should return `null` of the `double` type as PostgreSQL does:\r\n```sql\r\n# select date_part(null, date '2019-09-20');\r\n date_part \r\n-----------\r\n          \r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\n# select pg_typeof(date_part(null, date '2019-09-20'));\r\n    pg_typeof     \r\n------------------\r\n double precision\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `date_part()` function was added to maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL but current behavior of the function is different in handling null as `field`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_part(null, date'2019-09-20');\r\nError in query: null; line 1 pos

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to increase timeout to wait for executor(s) to be up in SparkContextSuite, as we observed these tests failed due to wait timeout.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere's some case that CI build is extremely slow which requires 3x or more time to pass the test. \r\n(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29139?focusedCommentId=16934034&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16934034)\r\n\r\nAllocating higher timeout wouldn't bring additional latency, as the code checks the condition with sleeping 10 ms per loop iteration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A, as the case is not likely to be occurred frequently.","created_at":"2019-09-20T04:59:51Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T18:47:07Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T15:57:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86474a57442e16d3dc53097d304f413ddc989184","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation operations.\r\n\r\nCase A:\r\nApplication appA insert overwrite table table_a with static partition overwrite.\r\nBut it was killed when committing tasks, because one task is hang.\r\nAnd parts of its committed tasks output is kept under /path/table_a/_temporary/0/.\r\n\r\nThen we rerun appA. It will reuse the staging dir  /path/table_a/_temporary/0/.\r\nIt executes successfully.\r\nBut it also commit the data reminded by killed application to destination dir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCase B:\r\n\r\nApplication appA insert overwrite table table_a.\r\n\r\nApplication appB insert overwrite table table_a, too.\r\n\r\nThey execute concurrently, and they may all use `/path/table_a/_temporary/0/` as workPath.\r\n\r\nAnd their result may be corruptted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we set a staging output path for InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation operation.\r\n\r\nThe output path is a multi level path and is composed of specified partition key-value pairs formatted `.spark-staging-${depth}/p1=v1/p2=v2/.../pn=vn`.\r\n\r\nWe can detect the conflict by checking the existence of relative staging output path.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\ntable_a(c1 string, a string, b string,...) partitioned by (a, b , ...)\r\n\r\nWhen writing to partition `a=1`, we need to check the existence of\r\n\r\n1. .spark-staging-0\r\n2. .spark-staging-1/a=1\r\n3. .spark-staging-2/a=1\r\n   ...\r\n4. .spark-staging-numPartitions/a=1\r\n\r\nWhen we found relative staging output path is existed, an exception would be thrown.\r\n\r\nThanks @advancedxy for providing the prototype of solution and valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nData may be corrupted without this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUser can see the exists of staging output path and may need clean up these path manually, when this path is belong to a killed application and has not been cleaned up gracefully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test.","created_at":"2019-09-20T03:05:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T07:24:10Z","closed_at":"2020-01-06T07:24:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b927dab106915b99a209bcb0124c1d1b2c01463e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch changes ReceiverSuite.\"receiver_life_cycle\" to record actual calls with timestamp in FakeReceiver/FakeReceiverSupervisor, which doesn't rely on timing of stopping and starting receiver in restarting receiver. It enables us to give enough huge timeout on verification of restart as we can verify both stopping and starting together.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe test is flaky without this patch. We increased timeout to fix flakyness of this test (https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/15adcc8273e73352e5e1c3fc9915c0b004ec4836) but even with longer timeout it has been still failing intermittently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've reproduced test failure artificially via below

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24373 , https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24404 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24434\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies SparkBuild so that the largest / slowest test suites (or collections of suites) can run in their own forked JVMs, allowing them to be run in parallel with each other. This opt-in / whitelisting approach allows us to increase parallelism without having to fix a long-tail of flakiness / brittleness issues in tests which aren't performance bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nSee comments in SparkBuild.scala for information on the details, including a summary of why we sometimes opt to run entire groups of tests in a single forked JVM .\r\n\r\nThe time of full new pull request test in Jenkins is reduced by around 53%:\r\nbefore changes: 4hr 40min\r\nafter changes: 2hr 13min\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis proposes to add a Spark config to control the caching behavior of ReliableCheckpointRDD.getPreferredLocations. If it is enabled, getPreferredLocations will only compute preferred locations once and cache it for later usage.\r\n\r\nThe drawback of caching the preferred locations is that when the cached locations are outdated, and lose data locality. It was documented in config document. To mitigate this, this patch also adds a config to set up expire time (default is 60 mins) for the cache. If time expires, the cache will be invalid and it needs to query updated location info.\r\n\r\nThis adds a test case. Looks like the most suitable test suite is CheckpointCompressionSuite. So this renames CheckpointCompressionSuite to CheckpointStorageSuite and put the test case into.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOne Spark job in our cluster fits many ALS models in parallel. The fitting goes well, but in next when we union all factors, the union operation is very slow.\r\n\r\nBy looking into the driver stack dump, looks like the driver spends a lot of time on computing preferred locations. As we checkpoint training data before fitting ALS, the time is spent on ReliableCheckpointRDD.getPreferredLocations. In this method, it will call DFS interface to query file status and block locations. As we have big number of partitions derived from the checkpointed RDD,  the union will spend a lot of time on querying the same information.\r\n\r\nIt reduces the time on huge union from few hours to dozens of minutes.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not limited to ALS so this change is not specified to ALS. Actually it is common usage to checkpoint data in Spark, to increase reliability and cut RDD linage. Spark operations on the checkpointed data, will be beneficial.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. This adds a Spark config users can use to control the cache behavior of preferred locations of checkpointed RDD.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKafka producers are now closed when `spark.kafka.producer.cache.timeout` reached which could be significant problem when processing big SQL queries. The workaround was to increase `spark.kafka.producer.cache.timeout` to a number where the biggest SQL query can be finished.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've adapted similar solution which already exists on the consumer side, namely applies Apache Commons Pool on the producer side as well. Main advantages choosing this solution:\r\n* Producers are not closed until they're in use\r\n* No manual reference counting needed (which may be error prone)\r\n* Thread-safe by design\r\n* Provides jmx connection to the pool where metrics can be fetched\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* Introduced producer side parameters to configure pool\r\n* Renamed `InternalKafkaConsumerPool` to `InternalKafkaConnectorPool` and made it abstract\r\n* Created 2 implementations from it: `InternalKafkaConsumerPool` and `InternalKafkaProducerPool`\r\n* Adapted `CachedKafkaProducer` to use `InternalKafkaProducerPool`\r\n* Changed `KafkaDataWriter` and `KafkaDataWriteTask` to release producer even in failure scenario\r\n* Added several new tests\r\n* Extended `KafkaTest` to clear not only producers but consumers as well\r\n* Renamed `InternalKafkaConsumerPoolSuite` to `InternalKafkaConnectorPoolSuite` where only consumer tests are checking the behavior (please see comment for reasoning)\r\n\r\nWhat this PR not yet contains(but intended when the main concept is stable):\r\n* User facing documentation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKafka producer closed after 10 minutes (with default settings).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + additional unit tests.\r\nCluster tests being started.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-19T12:35:07Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T13:34:15Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T01:06:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2351c69653f1e68d43bc6e1c2a5034eec3b3515","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows non-ascii string as an exception message in Python 2 by explicitly en/decoding in case of `str` in Python 2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously PySpark will hang when the `UnicodeDecodeError` occurs and the real exception cannot be passed to the JVM side.\r\n\r\nSee the reproducer as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef f():\r\n    raise Exception(\"中\")\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.master('local').getOrCreate()\r\nspark.sparkContext.parallelize([1]).map(lambda x: f()).count()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUser may not observe hanging for the similar cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test and manually checking.\r\n\r\nThis pr is based on #18324, credits should also go to @dataknocker. \r\nTo make lint-python happy for python3, it also includes a followup fix for #25814","created_at":"2019-09-19T07:05:15Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T23:09:34Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T23:09:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4864af6293595964b0d221bb0d8b716043e5b402","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25847/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25847/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25847/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6ec7aebcb0c1a2bda41a8b6a7b80ec670ff5bdb","head":{"label":"advancedxy:python_exception_19926_and_21045","ref":"python_exception_19926_and_21045","sha":"d6ec7aebcb0c1a2bda41a8b6a7b80ec670ff5bdb","user":{"login":"advancedxy","id":807537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy","html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18693947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODY5Mzk0Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"advancedxy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"advancedxy","id":807537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy","html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCredit to @vanzin as he found and commented on this while reviewing #25670 - [comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25670#discussion_r325383512).\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to specify UTF-8 explicitly while reading/writer event log file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe event log file is being read/written as default character set of JVM process which may open the chance to bring some problems on reading event log files from another machines. Spark's de facto standard character set is UTF-8, so it should be explicitly set to.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, if end users have been running Spark process with different default charset than \"UTF-8\", especially their driver JVM processes.
