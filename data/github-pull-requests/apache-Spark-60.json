What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the Python user-defined table function (UDTF) API for the `analyze` method to support general expressions for the `partitionBy` and `orderBy` fields of the `AnalyzeResult` class.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following UDTF specifies to partition by `partition_col / 10` so that all rows with values of this column between 0-9 arrive in the same partition, then all rows with values between 10-19 in the next partition, and so on.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@udtf\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self._partition_col = None\r\n        self._count = 0\r\n        self._sum = 0\r\n        self._last = None\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(*args, **kwargs):\r\n        return AnalyzeResult(\r\n            schema=StructType()\r\n            .add(\"partition_col\", IntegerType())\r\n            .add(\"count\", IntegerType())\r\n            .add(\"total\", IntegerType())\r\n            .add(\"last\", IntegerType()),\r\n            partitionBy=[PartitioningColumn(\"partition_col / 10\")],\r\n            orderBy=[\r\n                OrderingColumn(name=\"input\", ascending=True, overrideNullsFirst=False)\r\n            ],\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    def eval(self, row: Row):\r\n        self._partition_col = row[\"partition_col\"]\r\n        self._count += 1\r\n        self._last = row[\"input\"]\r\n        if row[\"input\"] is not None:\r\n            self._sum += row[\"input\"]\r\n\r\n    def terminate(self):\r\n        yield self._partition_col, self._count, self._sum, self._last\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis lets the UDTF partition by simple references to the columns of the input table just like before, but also gives the option to partition by general expressions based on those columns (just like the explicit `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses in the UDTF call in SQL).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR includes test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch relaxes the scope of `excludedTpcdsQueries` in `TPCDSBase` from `private` to `protected`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen working on TPCDS related tests with `TPCDSBase` or classes implementing it, sometime we need to exclude some queries. But `excludedTpcdsQueries` is private so it limits the extensibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, this is test only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `grpc*` from `1.56.0` to `1.59.3` for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n- https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.59.0/ (The first release for Python 3.12 support)\r\n- https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.59.1/\r\n- https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.59.2/\r\n- https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.59.3/ (The latest as of Today)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- To support `Python 3.12` because `grpcio` starts to support `Python 3.12` from `1.59.0`.\r\n\r\nNote that `grpc-java` introduced a breaking dependency change by spinning off a new `grpc-inprocess` module. We need to add that new dependency.\r\n- https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.59.0\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is a dependency

this is a WIP pull request. \r\n@bozhang2820  , I was wondering if there was something I can read to properly understand how to set sqlState for the error classes: I don't understand how to do it correctly. I know there's a table in the README.md file which helps, but I'm not too sure what tables the scheduler uses. I think if I fix this issue of not assigning sqlState correctly, I can also find out why the tests are failing.

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously, #40949 was raised which was auto closed due to staleness. This is a rework of that by addressing comments raised.\r\n\r\nThis PR seeks to improve the performance of serving the application list in History Server by storing the required information of the application as part of HDFS extended attributes instead of parsing the log file each time.\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n Improves the performance of the History Server listing page\r\n\r\nBelow is the comparison of the  time taken to complete `mergeApplicationListing` call [in FsHistoryProvider](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L700) that is called for every log file that is updated in the event log directory : \r\n\r\n| Event log size  | Extended Attributes disabled (in ms) | Extended Attributes enabled (in ms) |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 122MB  | 1340 | 137  |\r\n| 10.2MB  | 866 | 135  |\r\n| 5.5MB  | 645  | 136 |\r\n|  0.6MB | 505 | 134 |\r\n| 0.8MB  | 525 | 137  |\r\n\r\nAs we can see in the comparison above, irrespective of the event log size, the time to build the application listing for the app remains the same. This is hugely beneficial in clusters that have very large event log sizes.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n No.\r\n\r\n ### How was this patch tested?\r\n Will add unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR supports a new API in SparkContext `cancelJobGroupAndFutureJobs(jobGroup)`. It not only cancels the active jobs, future submitted jobs that belongs to this job group will be cancelled and not run.\r\n\r\nInternally, it uses a limited-size (current size: 1000, controlled by config `CANCELLED_JOB_GROUP_SET_SIZE`) FIFO set to record all the job group cancelled with this new API.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a new error class `SPARK_JOB_CANCELLED` without changing the error message at all, based on the assumption that it's a fundamental error that some downstream workload could rely on parsing the error message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprovements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade rocksdbjni from `8.3.2` to `8.8.1`.\r\n\r\nWhy version `8.8.1`? Because so far, `32` tests have been conducted based on version `8.6.7` or `8.8.1`, and no previous core issues have been found. The later versions have not been rigorously validated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.The full release notes: \r\n- https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v8.8.1\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v8.7.3\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v8.6.7\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v8.5.4\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v8.5.3\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v8.4.4\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v8.3.3\r\n\r\n2.Bug Fixes, eg:\r\n- Fixed a bug where compaction read under non direct IO still falls back to RocksDB internal prefetching after file system's prefetching returns non-OK status other than Status::NotSupported()\r\n- Fix a bug with atomic_flush=true that can cause DB to stuck after a flush fails\r\n- Fix a bug where if there is an error reading from offset 0 of a file from L1+ and that the file is not the first file in the sorted run, data can be lost in compaction and read/scan can return incorrect results.\r\n- Fix a bug where iterator may return incorrect result for DeleteRange() users if there was an error reading from a file.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Manually test:\r\n```\r\n./build/mvn clean install -pl core -am -Dtest.exclude.tags=org.apache.spark.tags.ExtendedLevelDBTest -fn\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `Python 3.12` to Infra docker images.\r\n\r\nNote that `Python 3.12` has a breaking change in the installation.\r\n- `distutils` module itself is removed at Python 3.12 via [PEP-632](https://peps.python.org/pep-0632) in favor of `packaging` package.\r\n- Apache Spark 4.0.0 is ready for Python 3.12 via SPARK-45390 by removing `distutils` usages\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43192\r\n- However, some 3rd party packages are not ready for Python 3.12. So, this PR skips those kind of packages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a preparation to add a daily `Python 3.12` GitHub Action job later for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\nAs of today, Apache Spark 4.0.0 has Python 3.8 ~ Python 3.11 test coverage.\r\n- Python 3.9 (Main)\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml\r\n- PyPy3.8, Python 3.10, Python 3.11 (Daily)\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_python.yml\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new doc page describing the new data source, `state data source`.\r\n\r\nWorth noting that we explicitly mention the data source as experimental, so that we do not close the opportunity to improve further if it's backward incompatible.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe data source is an user-facing one and would be evolved over time, hence we'll need to document and publicize it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, doc change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBuilt the docs directory with jekyll.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, this Python example will fail with this error: `AnalysisException: [COLUMN_NOT_DEFINED_IN_TABLE] sort column age is not defined in table ...`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"902\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 16 21 27\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/66282705/ddfe5409-f9a6-4075-9181-7f0c6195615a\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, the SQL examples are inconsistent with the Python/Scala/Java ones. For example, this table should be created using the JSON/CSV data source, instead of parquet. And the table names in SQL examples are also inconsistent.\r\n<img width=\"911\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 16 21 44\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/66282705/43669934-1991-43b2-922e-86cf275dffb4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManually run `basic_datasource_example` \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRecently, `ReleaseSession` RPC was added for the clients to be able to stop the session, and release resources on the server. However, if the client dies without sending it, the session will still linger on the server for 1 hour. In this PR, an `ExtendSession` RPC is added. Active client using it will actively send `ExtendSession` \"ping\" requests from a background thread. A server receiving those pings can be more aggressive in timing out the session once they stop. If a client does not send `ExtendSession`, the old behavior is preserved by the server.\r\n\r\nTODO details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBetter control of session lifecycle.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nChanges the internal controls of keeping the Spark Connect session alive. The default should be close to what it was previously.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWIP\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nGithub Copilot was assisting in some boilerplate auto-completion.\r\n\r\nGenerated-by: Github

Since Variant is represented in columnar form as a struct, it must use `StructNullableTypeConverter` so that nulls are set properly in child column vectors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFixes a potential when setting nulls in Variant columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, Variant is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing unit test to test Variant. It fails without the fix.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-20T16:20:03Z","updated_at":"2023-11-21T01:21:58Z","closed_at":"2023-11-21T01:21:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d7931fdcbc9af63c37fac2f1ae7be43dce94a90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43911/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43911/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43911/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/15a7b2b1d56b858bda87759f3ae2e1242370ec24","head":{"label":"cashmand:SPARK-45827-fixnulls","ref":"SPARK-45827-fixnulls","sha":"15a7b2b1d56b858bda87759f3ae2e1242370ec24","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43573 that restore the console progress bar in Spark shells.\r\nPreviously it was `CR + bar + CR` but mistakenly it was fixed as `s\"${CR}bar$CR\"`.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.range(10000).repartition(4000).count()\r\nbar\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.range(10000).repartition(4000).count()\r\n[Stage 5:==============>                                     (1121 + 16) / 4000]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo have the proper working console bar. This is a regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNot yet because the main change has not been released out yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark\r\nspark.range(10000).repartition(4000).count()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-20T03:52:49Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:13Z","closed_at":"2023-11-20T04:04:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb8bafcd4ca1617e58fb72f02543147dc4722508","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `pyspark.ml.torch.tests.test_distributor` test to compare the sorted results. The output fro PyTouch for the same input returns a different order of output which I presume is from different Python version (e.g., the order in `set`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the tests deterministic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Change the silencing of the widening conversion compilation warnings in the parent `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild` to throw an error\r\n2. All widening conversion compilation warnings were removed. This almost exclusively involved adding `.toDouble` to longs. However, it also involved some `.toFloat` on ints and longs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt allows us to upgrade to Scala 2.13 without adding a bunch of compilation issues. This is removing the following compilation error\r\n```shell\r\n[error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala:1207:60: Widening conversion from Long to Double is deprecated because it loses precision. Write `.toDouble` instead. [quickfixable]\r\n[error] Applicable -Wconf / @nowarn filters for this fatal warning: msg=<part of the message>, cat=deprecation, site=org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager.checkSpeculatableTasks\r\n[error]       foundTasks = checkAndSubmitSpeculatableTasks(timeMs, threshold, customizedThreshold = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests were added. \r\nFor every profile (including the base profile), I ran `mvn clean compile test-compile`. I then `grep`ed any lines that had the word `Wide` in it. I determined I was done when no output remained.\r\n\r\nHere is a script of what was run:\r\n```shell\r\nmvn clean compile test-compile |& tee output.txt\r\ncat output.txt | grep .*Wide.* |& tee output-widening.txt\r\nmvn clean compile test-compile -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl |& tee output-spark-ganglia-lgpl.txt\r\ncat output-spark-ganglia-lgpl.txt | grep .*Wide.* |& tee

output-kinesis-asl-widening.txt\r\nmvn clean compile test-compile -Pdocker-integration-tests |& tee output-docker-integration-tests.txt\r\ncat output-docker-integration-tests.txt | grep .*Wide.* |&

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43858 that documents the newly moved functions:\r\n- `org.apache.spark.sql.functions.partitioning.*` becomes Scala-specific because they can't be used in Java side.\r\n- `org.apache.spark.sql.functions.*` remain as Java-specific.\r\n- Document `pyspark.sql.functions.partitioning.*`, and remove deprecated `pyspark.sql.functions.*`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor users to use the moved functions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe main change has not been released out yet, so no. It adds the newly moved functions into the docs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by building docs (Python).\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRenames (standardize) the `TaskScheduler` reference variables from `scheduler`/`sched` etc to `taskScheduler`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMultiple classes in  `core/` ( like `CoarseGrainedScheduler`, `StandaloneScheduler`, etc) currently hold reference to TaskScheduler in a variable `scheduler`/ `sched`, etc. This is confusing when reading scheduler code. This PR renames these reference variables to `taskScheduler` to make the code more readable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMove DetermineTableStats to resolution rules.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`MergeIntoTable#sourceTable` is used for `ReplaceData#groupFilterCondition` in `RewriteMergeIntoTable`, SourceTable in  `ReplaceData#groupFilterCondition` is resolved and will not be applied to `DetermineTableStats` through `ResolveSubquery#resolveSubQueries`. So, when there is a hive table without stats in `MergeIntoTable#sourceTable`, IllegalStateException will occur.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move the partitioning expressions for DSv2 `hours`, `days`, `months`, `years`, and `bucket` from `org.apache.spark.sql.functions` to `org.apache.spark.sql.functions.partitioning`.\r\n\r\n**Note** that the old references are deprecated in Python only because Scala 3 upgrade ([SIP-30](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/static-members.html)) is required for Java to access `org.apache.spark.sql.functions.partitioning` as same as the original way (e.g., `import static org.apache.spark.sql.functions.partitioning.*`). I filed a JIRA separately for this SPARK-45970. For Python, there is no problem so the functions are deprecated properly.\r\n\r\n**Note** that this PR includes the necessary refactoring that makes `pyspark.sql.functions` into a package in order to allow `import pyspark.sql.functions.partitioning` as if Scala allows `import org.apache.spark.sql.functions.partitioning._`\r\n\r\nFrom\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npyspark\r\n└── sql\r\n    └── functions.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npyspark\r\n└── sql\r\n    └── functions\r\n        ├── __init__.py     # Maintain the backward compatibility about imports. \r\n        ├── builtin.py      # Previous `functions.py`\r\n        └── partitioning.py # New partitioning functions.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are no user-facing changes here except that several non-API private attributes are not accessible anymore (e.g., `from pyspark.sql.functions import _invoke_function_over_columns`) In that case, they have to manually import `from pyspark.sql.functions.builtin import _invoke_function_over_columns`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThose expressions can ONLY be used in DSv2 `partitionBy` but they exist in the same place with other expressions that confuse users that they believe they can use with other places such as `select`. They at least have to be grouped separately so users don't be confused.\r\n\r\nJust for doubly sure, I had an offline discussion including the original author, and related people a while ago.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes:\r\n- Moves the partitioning expressions for DSv2 `hours`, `days`, `months`, and `bucket` from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR attempts to keep the depth of the LogicalPlan tree unchanged,  when columns are added /dropped/renamed .\r\nThis is done via a special new rule called EarlyCollapseProject.\r\nThis is applied after the analysis has happened, but the analyzed plan is yet to be assigned to the holder variable in QueryExecution / DataFrame.\r\n\r\n**EarlyCollapseProject** code does the following :\r\n1) If  the incoming plan is a  project1 -> Project2 - X , then it collapses the two projects into one.  such that the final plan looks like Project -> X\r\n2) If the incoming plan is of the form  Project1 -Filter1 - Filter2 ---FilterN - Project 2 - X, then it collapses the Project1 and Project2 as \r\nProject -> Filter1 - Filter2 -- FilterN - X.\r\nPls note that in this case it is as if Project2 is pulled up for collapse, rather than vice versa.\r\nThe reason for this is that it is possible that Project1 has some behaviour ( like a UDF) which is not capable of handling certain data , which otherwise would be filtered by the filter chain.  If project1 was pushed below Filter chain, then the unfiltered rows can cause issues. Existing spark tests on UDF have test which is sensitive to this.\r\n\r\n3) The EarlyCollapseProject IS NOT applied if \r\n  a) any of the incoming Project nodes ( Project1 or Project2) have tag LogicalPlan.PLAN_ID_TAG set ( which implies it is coming from a spark client. It is not handled as of now, because for clients the subsequent resolutions are tied to a direct mapping of the tag ID associated with each Project, and removal of any Project via collapse , breaks the code)\r\n \r\nb) If the incoming Project2  has any UserDefinedExpression or non deterministic expression. Or If Project2's child is a Window node.\r\nThe reason for non-deterministic exclusion is to ensure the functionality is not broken, as collapse project  will replicate the non-deterministic expression. Similarly for UserDefinedExpression and Window node below Project2, the collapse is avoided, as it can cause replication & hence re-evaluation of expensive code when collapsed.\r\n\r\n4) The other important thing the EarlyCollapseProject does, is to store the attributes in the Collapsed Project node, which get dropped and because of collapse , they loose their presence from the Plan completely. \r\nThis is needed so as to resurrect dropped attributes, if needed arises, so as to do the resolution correctly.\r\nThe dropped attributes are stored in a Seq using the tag LogicalPlan.DROPPED_NAMED_EXPRESSIONS\r\nThe need for this arises in following situations:\r\nsay we start with a DataFrame df1 , with plan as  Project2 ( a, b, c)  - X\r\nthen we create a new DataFrame df2 = df1.select( b, c).  Here, attribute a is dropped\r\nBecause of the EarlyCollapseProject rule, the new DataFrame df2 , will have logical plan as Project(b, c) - X\r\nNow spark allows a DataFrame df3 = df2.filter( a > 7). \r\nwhich would result in a LogicalPlan as  Filter( a > 7) -> Project(b, c) -> X\r\nBut because \"a\" has been dropped , its resolution is no longer possible.\r\nTo retain the existing behaviour and hence resolution, the Project(b, c) contains the dropped the NamedExpression \"a\" , and hence this can be revived as last effort for resolution.\r\n\r\n**ColumnResolutionHelper** code change:\r\nThe reviving of dropped attributes for plan resolution is done via the code change in ColumnResolutionHelper.resolveExprsAndAddMissingAttrs, where the dropped attributes stored in the Tag are revived back for resolution.\r\n\r\nCode changes in **CacheManager**\r\nThe major code  change  is in **CacheManager**. \r\nPreviously as any change in projection ( addition, drop, rename, shuffling) resulted in a new Project , it was straightforward to lookup cache for fragment logical plan match, as the plan cached would always match a query subtree , if the subtree is used in an immutable form to build complete query tree.  But since in this PR , a new Project is collapsed with the existing Project, the subtree is no longer the same as what was cached. Apart from that, the presence of filters between two projects, also muddles the situation.\r\n\r\n**Case 1**: _using InMemoryRelation in a plan resulting from collapse of 2 consecutive Projects._\r\n\r\n We start with a  DataFrame df1 with plan = Project2  -> X\r\nand then we cache this df1. So that the CachedRepresentation has ( IMR and the logical Plan as Project2 -> X)\r\n\r\nNow we create a new data frame Df2 = df1.select ( some Proj)  , which due to early collapse would look like\r\n    Project -> X\r\nClearly Project may no longer be same as Project2, so a direct check with CacheManager will not result in matching IMR.\r\n But  clearly  X are same .\r\nSo the criteria is : an IMR can be used IFF following conditions are met\r\n1) X  for both is same ( i.e incoming Project's child and CachedPlan's Project's child are same)\r\n2) All the NamedExpressions of Incoming Project are expressable in terms of output of Project2  ( which is what IMR's output is )\r\n     To do the check for  above point  **_2_**, we consider following logic\r\n    Now given that X for both are same,  which means their outputs are equivalent, so we remap the cached plan's Project2 in terms  of output attribute ( Expr IDs) of X  of incoming Project Plan \r\n  This will help us find out following\r\n   1) Those NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are directly same as NamedExpressions of Project 2\r\n   2) Those NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are some functions of output of Project 2\r\n   3) Those NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are sort of Literal Constants and independent of output of Project2\r\n  4) Those NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are functions of some attributes but those attributes are unavailable in the  output of Project2\r\n\r\nSo so long as above # 4  types of NamedExpressions are empty, it means that InMemoryRelation of the CachedPlan is usable.\r\nand this above logic is coded in CacheManager. The logic involves modifying the NamedExpressions in incoming Project, in terms of the Seq[Attributes] which will be forced on the IMR.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Case 2**: _using InMemoryRelation in a plan resulting from collapse of Projects interspersed with Filters._\r\n\r\n We start with a  DataFrame df1 with plan = Filter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2  -> X\r\nand then we cache this df1. So that the CachedRepresentation has ( IMR and the logical Plan as\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 ->  Project2 -> X )\r\n\r\nNow we create a new data frame Df2 = df1.filter( f2) .filter(f1).select (some Proj)  , which due to early collapse would look like\r\n  Project -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\n( this is because in case of filters, Project2 would be pulled up for collapse)\r\n\r\nClearly here the cached plan chain\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2  -> X\r\nis no longer directly similar to \r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\nBut it is still possible to use IMR as actually the cached plan's LogicalPlan can be used as a subtree of the incoming Plan.\r\n\r\nThe logic for such check is partly the same as above for 2 consecutive Projects, with some handling for filters.\r\nThe algo for this is as follows\r\n1) Identify the \"child\"  X from the incoming plan  and the Cached Plan 's Logical Plan. for similarity check.\r\nFor incoming Plan, we reach  X, and store all the consecutive Filter Chain.\r\n\r\nFor the Cached Plan,  we identify the first encountered Project , which is Project 2, and its child which is X.\r\n\r\nso we have X from both incoming and cached plan, and we identify the incoming project \"Project\" and the CachedPlan's \"Project2\".\r\n Now we can apply the Rule of **case 1** of two consecutive Projects, and correctly modify the NamedExpressions of incoming Project , in terms of Seq[Attributes] which will be enforced upon the IMR.\r\n\r\nBut we also need to ensure that the filter chain present in Cached Plan i.e Filter3 -> Filter4  is a subset of filter chain in the incoming Plan , which is Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4.\r\n**Now thing to note is that**\r\n  for incoming plan it is \r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\nIn the above chain, the filters are expressed in terms of output of X\r\nBut for cached plan the filters are expressed in terms of output of Project2.\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2  -> X\r\n\r\nSo for comparison we need to express the filter chain of Cached Plan in terms of X, by pulling up the P2 above filters such that\r\nit is now \r\nProject2 -> Filter3' -> Filter4' -> -> X\r\n\r\nNow we can see that if  we compare \r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\n\r\nand find that Filter3' -> Filter4'  is a subset of  Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4  \r\nand as the Project and Project2 are already compatible ( by **case  point 1**)\r\nwe can use cached IMR , with a modified Project with partial filter chain.\r\n\r\ni.e we should be able to get a plan like\r\n\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> IMR.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDue to addition/mods of new rules Spark 3.0 , clients are seeing extremely large increase in query compilation time, when the client code is adding one column at a time in a loop.  Even though API doc does not recommend such practice, but it happens and clients are reluctant to change the code. So this PR attempts to handle the situation where columns are added not in a single shot but  one at a time .
