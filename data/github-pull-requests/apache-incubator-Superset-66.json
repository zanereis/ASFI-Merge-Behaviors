This is due to a two-step process for downloading charts:\r\n- Charts in the dashboard are added to the Redux store's `sliceEntities.slices` object  when the dashboard is loaded, but are missing the metadata necessary to correctly render as draggable cards.\r\n- When the edit button is clicked, all charts owned by the current user are downloaded with necessary metadata and merged into the `sliceEntities.slices` store object.  Because some charts added to the dashboard might not be owned by the current user, the `sliceEntities.slices` entries for those charts are not updated with the necessary metadata.\r\nThis PR removes the filter from the 2nd request that limits it to charts owned by the current user, so all charts are now correctly downloaded and merged into the store object.\r\n\r\n**Note: I'm opening this PR under the assumption that this filter was present for no good reason.  If there's a reason that you should only be able to add charts that you own to a dashboard, let me know and I'll find another solution.**\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/178610807-d8819dea-e902-4b89-87eb-1c42804b301a.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/178610835-151d3bce-6b62-467e-a27d-e08f13ef5d2d.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe original Superset had been using a query API(`/api/v1/chart/data`) to get data samples, but was refactored to use a [separate API](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20170) for getting data samples. The purpose of the refactoring is to get samples by passing only `dataset/datasouce id`.\r\n\r\nThe recent [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20281) introduced multiple datasouce type and duplicate samples codes.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to merge all samples logic and to provide filtering and pagination on top of the original samples API.\r\n\r\nWe can remove the original

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen Explore was moved into the SPA, it changed url from `/superset/explore` to `/explore`.  This PR updates (hopefully) all of the URL references to `/superset/explore` that weren't updated accordingly.  In detail:\r\n- `/superset/explore/?{queryparams}` --> `/explore/?{queryparams}`\r\n- `/superset/explore/table/{id}` --> `/explore/?dataset_type=table&dataset_id={id}`\r\n- `/superset/explore/p/{hash}` --> **unchanged**\r\n- `/superset/explore_json` --> **unchanged**\r\n\r\nThis should hopefully fix thumbnail and alert generation and other broken links.\r\n\r\nThe following tweaks are also included:\r\n- The URL that Selenium attempts to access to generate thumbnails is fixed so the `standalone` query param is `true` instead of `True`.\r\n- The frontend now accepts `True` as a query param for the above, just in case.\r\n- The logic that expands short URLs is updated so previously-created short URLs to Explore should still resolve correctly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Test that thumbnails generate correctly (`/testenv up FEATURE_THUMBNAILS=true `)\r\n- Test that PNG reports of charts send correctly (`/testenv up FEATURE_ALERT_REPORTS=true`)\r\n- Test that URLs of the format `/superset/slice/{id}/standalone=true` resolve correctly to a standalone-mode chart\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently when user open Explore, we always send a request to `/v1/explore` endpoint, which assembles Explore initial data - slice, form_data and datasource.\r\nWhen user goes to Explore from Dashboard (by clicking \"Edit chart\" or char title), most of the data needed to assemble Explore should already be available in Redux store.\r\nThis PR implements using data from Dashboard Redux store to initialize Explore without calling `/v1/explore` endpoint.\r\n\r\nIf user opens Explore from Dashboard, check if slice, formData, datasourceId and datasourceType are available. If they are, fetch datasource metadata and hydrate Explore using slice, formData and datasource.\r\nIf they are not available, call `/v1/explore` and hydrate Explore.\r\n\r\nWe can't reuse datasource from Dashboard. Datasources metadata on Dashboard is trimmed so that datasource contains only columns and metrics used by charts on that dashboard. In Explore we need to be able to access all columns and metrics, which means we must fetch those from API.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to dashboard\r\n2. Click \"Edit chart\"\r\n3. Verify that Explore has opened correctly and that we did not call `/v1/explore/` endpoint\r\n4. Enter Explore from any other entry point (for example Charts list or Welcome page)\r\n5. Verify that we do call `/v1/explore`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIf the feature flag `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` is enabled, the **Time-Series Bar Char v2** becomes **Bar Chart v2** and has a field named **X-Axis**. However, if the Bar Chart is configured on horizontal mode, the X-Axis should be re-named to Y-Axis.\r\n\r\nThis PR expands the type for the control label & description to be computed, and then does so for the above scenario.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/178072360-bd11ef82-8773-4e2d-939b-ddbcd265c9a7.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/178069240-784e800c-ed6d-466e-b808-5481e79c05ea.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Enable the `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature\r\n2. Hover the **+ **icon > **Chart**.\r\n3. Use the `Vehicle Sales` Dataset, and the **Bar Chart v2**.\r\n4. Set `count(*)` on the **Metrics**, and `product_line` on the **X-Axis** field.\r\n5. Navigate to the **CUSTOMIZE** tab.\r\n6. Switch to the **HORIZONTAL** orientation.\r\n7. Navigate back to the **DATA** tab.\r\n\r\nEnsure the label changes accordingly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the annotation on the time series chart has been

This error is from the TypeScript [type guard function](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/e33164024a17bb7e6de9d40b9fc60996dc9406fc/superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/src/query/types/AnnotationLayer.ts#L183).\r\n2. The annotation on the master branch doesn't apply annotation_data from the query response.\r\n\r\nAfter these fixes it turns out that the Apply button is not working again, which I think should be fixed in a seprated PR. Also, the annnotation layer logic is very difficult to maintain, I would suggest investing more time in rewriting the current codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/177987046-22838736-7cde-452a-afd2-26177bf7f74d.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/177986549-5a267c13-58d1-442a-8d39-e251ab0cf105.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently when using embedding a dashboard, calls to the `/log/` endpoint return a 401 response. This is because `navigator.sendBeacon` was not sending the guest token used for authentication in the way that `SupersetClient` does.\r\n\r\nThis PR will ensure the guest token is included so that event logging works for embedded dashboards. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Embed a dashboard \r\n2. Perform actions that trigger calls to `/log/`\r\n3. See that these calls succeed with a 200 response\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nDashboards and Explore contain Redux state about datasources. This PR refactors the code to extract this functionality into shared files under the `datasource` folder.\r\n\r\nThe names datasource and dataset are being used interchangeably. It would be a good idea to rename all to dataset in the future but this involves changing the Redux state, so it requires its own PR.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20572\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWe shouldn‚Äôt have any differences in terms of functionality.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ]

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR is my POC of frontend tagging for dashboards, charts, and queries.\r\n\r\nNote: This was for a hackathon and is currently incomplete:\r\n- Editing tags is broken, you can double click the tag to edit but it will break when you try to press enter to submit the change.\r\n- The query tags do not persist yet\r\n- The list view searches do not work yet\r\n- The welcome page has a dropdown for tags but it is not to design spec\r\n- Excuse the mess, I did not clean up my code before pushing this up so there may be some arbitrary commented code and console.logs laying around from trying to debug editing tags.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Global search from list view (this exists in the Charts, Dashboards, and Saved Queries list views):\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 11 56 24

INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Go to a chart, dashboard, or make a query and look at the results\r\n- Click `+ New Tag` and type a tag name\r\n- Press enter and observe the new tag\r\n- Go to the Welcome page and search for your tag under the Tag dropdown\r\n- Observe your tagged item, you can click this and it will bring you to the item you tagged\r\n- Press the `X` on the tag to delete it\r\n- Search for your tag on the welcome page and observe that it no longer shows up since it is no longer tagged\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

permalink API always return the same key if the request payload is the same---i.e., for a given dashboard state, a user should always get a stable permalink when they request one.\r\n\r\nThis is a required change for #20552 and #19354 as we don't want to generate a new permalink each time a dashboard report is executed.\r\n\r\nThe Explore permalink should probably do the same, but this PR only changes the behavior for dashboard permalink just in case it causes any problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A. This is a pure backend change. There should be no visible changes to users.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Copy a permalink for dashboard---you can do it in the \"...\" menu on the dashboard page, or in charts or tabs.\r\n   <img width=\"575\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/177657369-ffa725fa-fed4-4328-9877-4edc9a314b8b.png\">\r\n\r\n3. The link should always be the same no matter how many times you click on the trigger button/link\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nThere's a bug in post processing for tables and pivot-table charts when the data is empty for both json and csv formats. We'll now just return the original results instead of trying to apply any post-processing on it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nCurrently raises a 500\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate a chart with no results for a pivot table and then try to export pivoted results as csv. This would also break on alert/reports when formatting the report as a csv. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

SUMMARY\r\n- Apache Echarts has `showMaxLabel` option set to `false` by default for time axis (https://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/master/src/coord/axisDefault.ts#L178), so we need to override it for our time series charts in order to not be fixed with hidden and instead let the library determine whether to show the label of the max tick\r\n- Add AxisType enum so we stop comparing agains raw strings when checking xAxis type\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Background\r\nthe `pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(series)` is not able to check a series that contains `datetime.date`, the `dtype` of the dataframe will be `object` e.g.:\r\n```python\r\n>>> import datetime\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n\r\n>>> series = pd.Series([datetime.date(2018, 1, 1), datetime.date(2018, 1, 2)])\r\n>>> pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(series)\r\nFalse\r\n>>>

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19854 introduced frontend logic which would check that (for Alpha users) only owners can edit datasets. The issue is the definition of ownership between the frontend and backend differs. Specifically the frontend merely checks whether the user is listed as a owner‚Äîper the [owners](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L694) relationship‚Äîwhereas the backend uses the [check_ownership](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/3483446c28113fb9eb1e8adb8978e305ff5e7c65/superset/views/base.py#L647-L691) method which checks (in addition to the `owner` and `owners` relationships) whether the user is the creator. This dichotomy means that creators who are not explicitly listed as owners are unable to edit their datasets.\r\n\r\nUnwinding the logic surfaces additional observations regarding ownership for various assets, i.e., charts, dashboards, datasets, and reports:\r\n\r\n1. The DAO logic correctly adds the creator as an explicit owner ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/datasets/commands/create.py#L92-L93)) so this isn't an issue for any asset which was created via a DAO commend.\r\n2. Prior to the DAO logic only dashboards contained [pre_add](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/8e29ec5a6685867ffc035d20999c54c2abe36fb1/superset/views/dashboard/views.py#L96-L97) logic which added the creator as an explicit owner meaning that this issue only impacts historical charts and datasets.\r\n3. The `check_ownership` method contained a check for an `owner` relationship however grepping the code per `git grep \"\\bowner = relationship\\b\"` yielded no matches, i.e., it served no purpose.\r\n\r\nGiven these insights this PR performs the following:\r\n\r\n1. It adds a database migration to add all creators as owners (if not already listed) for both charts and datasets. Granted this may be a little presumptive, i.e., we may be re-adding someone as an \"owner\" who was previously removed, however there's no way to determine what the intent of the current database state is.\r\n2. It updates the `check_ownership` method to remove checking the `owner` (obsolete) and `created_by` (addressed in the migration) fields.\r\n\r\nFinally a few things worth noting:\r\n\r\n1. The frontend likely should rely on an API call to check ownership to adhere to the DRY principle and ensure that the frontend and backend logic for ownership is consistent.\r\n2. The backend SQLAlchemy `pre_add`, `pre_update`, etc. checks should likely be deprecated given the logic also resides in the DAO commands. This really muddies the code logic and makes it hard to grok how things work (or should work).\r\n3. I'm not really sure why the DAO `validate` command also populates fields, i.e., adds owners. This seems somewhat contradictory and non-intuitive, i.e., validation shouldn't update the model. I gather it was likely for efficiency reasons, but I sense there is merit in rewriting the DAO logic to break up the validation and population phases.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR changes the info and error icons on the Explore screen to AntD icons, and makes the validation error color ~blue~ **yellow** instead of red if required fields aren't filled because the user just created a new chart or selected a new viz type.  If the user clears required fields that were previously filled, the validation color is still red. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/177659825-c566af4f-ca4e-4473-bf90-06bd8642fb23.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/179296184-4eb75034-c393-4d0b-a3aa-add985f59758.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Confirm that when creating a new chart, validation errors from missing fields are ~blue~ **yellow** instead of red.\r\n- Confirm that when changing the viz type, validation errors from missing fields are also ~blue~ **yellow** instead of red.\r\n- Confirm that new info and error icons are visible, and that no old-style info or error icons are left on the Explore screen that I missed.\r\n- Confirm that other than the above changes, the UI for Explore looks the same as before.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently, when user clicks on chart title or \"Edit chart\" button in Dashboard view, we first make a POST request to get form_data_key and then open Explore in a new window. In order to fully benefit from Explore SPA project, we need to stay in the SPA context when transitioning from Dashboard to Explore - which means that we should open Explore in the same tab.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default behaviour to open Explore in the same tab using the React Router. If user wants to open Explore in separate tab, they can do cmd+click (on Mac) or ctrl+click (on Linux/Windows). The tooltip was adjusted to make the feature easier to discover. \r\n\r\nWhy can't we just make the chart title a link and let user \"right click -> open in a new tab\"? When user clicks \"Edit chart\", we first need to send an API request to get the form_data_key, which is required to correctly pass dashboard context to Explore.   For this reason we can't use standard HTML <a> element and instead we use a button with `onClick` callback.\r\nIn the future, we'll work on improving this behaviour, so that we can use a link to transition to Explore.\r\n\r\nSince this change in flow (open Explore in the same tab by default) might be disruptive, user can bring back the old behaviour by enabling the new feature flag `DASHBOARD_EDIT_CHART_IN_NEW_TAB`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/177313748-4b63608e-d761-4ef1-904c-bb4733d73648.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Go to dashboard\r\n2. Click on chart title or \"Edit chart\" in menu or \"Edit chart\" in \"View as table\" modal\r\n3. Verify that Explore opens in the same tab\r\n4. Go back to Dashboard\r\n5. Click on chart title while holding CMD\r\n6. Verify that Explore opens in new tab\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `GENERIC_CHART_AXES`.\r\n2. Create Bar v2 charts with different types in the x-types.\r\n\r\nEnsure the stack option is only available for categorical types, and that it works as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR updates the color scheme for Dashboards and Charts when a color scheme in EXTRA_CATEGORICAL_COLOR_SCHEMES or EXTRA_SEQUENTIAL_COLOR_SCHEMES is deleted or changed.\r\n\r\n### KNOWN LIMITATIONS\r\nAt the moment, it isn't possible to regenerate the shared label colors for all charts when the Dashboard is using tabs. This is a problem affecting master too that will be investigated separetely.\r\n\r\n### TEST COVERAGE\r\nMore test cases covering the color schemes' behaviours will be published In a separate PR

SUMMARY\r\nFix and improve `value_a_z`, `value_z_a` sort order for pivot table\r\n1.  work on any size of cols and rows in pivot table options, groups them\r\n2. keep subtotals with their groups\r\n3. keep subtotals on required top/bottom position\r\n4. switches to a-z order in case of same numerical values\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate any pivot v2 table with\r\n1. at least two rows (or/and to cols) and summable metric\r\n5. switch on subtotals\r\n6. try switch different orderings (all row/col groups should be consistent)\r\n7. try switch subtotal position (all row/col groups should be consistent and subtotals should be at expected place)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nKnown issue - not tested for non monotonic summable aggregates with natural order (sum, count, avg).\r\nIt's because it collect raw subtotals sumarrizing internal values.\r\nSome aggregate function (min, max for) could have unexpected behavior in sorting.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-01T14:23:09Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T02:00:17Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"606786e6af77872fce8642f47cb53795d8e0df2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"justinpark","id":1392866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1392866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark","html_url":"https://github.com/justinpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2650367752,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMzY3NzUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/hold:testing!","name":"hold:testing!","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"On

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen the user changes the name of a virtual dataset, any user that had specific access to said dataset will no longer be able to access it.\r\n\r\nThe issue is because the `set_perm` function is changing the table name but not the permission and view_model, thus, a new permission/view is created and the users keep pointing to the old one.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that, on name change, those records are also updated.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/176782468-0c324cd4-5216-46aa-a633-4ebb8b0a25f3.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/176782538-d19ab23b-7bbb-4a88-af30-5d4b523bf301.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Create a virtual dataset\r\n2. Create a new role and grant access to the created dataset\r\n3. Create a new user and assign the Gamma role, and the role created in 2.\r\n4. Access the dataset list with that user\r\n5. With the admin account, change the dataset table name\r\n6. Ensure the user created in 3 can still see the dataset, now with the new name\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nRenders Explore in SPA under `/explore`. Previously, Explore was displayed under `/superset/explore`. This will open a number of possibilities for in-context features and also reduce the development complexity associated with keeping multiple React applications.\r\n\r\nThis PR also replaces SPA-related Explore navigation with React Router and removes the previous entry point files.\r\n\r\nFollow-up of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20519\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/176955027-010c15b7-d3a7-4537-86ef-c8d7e40a6384.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWe need to test all features that are associated with Explore, like:\r\n- Navigate from multiple places to Explore (welcome page, charts list, add a chart, dashboard, etc)\r\n- Refresh the Explore page and check if the content persists\r\n- Check permalinks\r\n- Check Explore save flow\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-30T18:59:52Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:06:38Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T19:58:10Z","merged_at":"2022-07-05T19:58:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"662bab1e6d1b502a77a117f8ab7e82d3029151c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"üö¢

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis changes the current save query button into a split save button if the database has \"Allow this database to be explored\" enabled. When the user clicks the caret section of the button, they can now save the query as a dataset.\r\n\r\n`Bonus`: In order to create this button, I conveniently needed to fix the styling on the \"Run\" query split button. The split line now goes all the way through the button and the caret is centered.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### BEFORE:\r\n![saveButtonBefore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176063560-492b124a-40ce-4aaf-8745-691ddfa271ef.png)\r\n![runButtonBefore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176329868-20285ba0-16be-41ad-89fc-eb7dd6aba913.png)\r\n\r\n#### AFTER:\r\n![splitSaveButtonAfter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176063585-59e7074d-cec6-4bd3-b26e-276fd5a1a090.png)\r\n![saveButtonAfter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176063591-55dafb31-a843-4052-8372-a10bb9d0526a.png)\r\n![runButtonAfter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176067479-c5ba02bc-834a-4d0b-8e01-3b1eb0787c65.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- From SqlLab, open a query for a database that has \"Allow this database to be explored\" enabled.\r\n  - Observe the new split save button\r\n    - Click the \"Save\" section of the button to see the save query modal\r\n    - Click the caret `v` section of the button, then click \"Save dataset\" to see the save dataset modal\r\n    - Both of these modals should be fully functional\r\n- From SqlLab, open a query for a database that does NOT have \"Allow this database to be explored\" enabled.\r\n  - Observe that the save button is a normal button, not split\r\n    - Clicking this button should show the save query modal\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhile working on #20560 I ended up doing some cleaning up of typing for the Dashboard view:\r\n- `./reducers/types.ts` looked like it contained mostly unused types and almost-duplicates of types in `./types.ts`, so I moved the few types that were actually in use to `./types.ts` and deleted `./reducers/types.ts`.\r\n- Some of the types in `./types.ts` were also unused or didn't accurately describe what they were typing, so I rewrote a lot of that file.\r\n- I converted `./actions/hydrate.js` to TypeScript, mostly in an effort to try to get some additional assurance that removing `charts[i].formData` wouldn't break anything.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nNo functionality should be impacted by this PR, so try out as much Dashboard functionality as possible, especially editing dashboards, and make sure nothing behaves differently than before.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n<strike>Depends on: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20632 , please review after it is merged.</strike> (merged)\r\n\r\nWe want to allow users to specify which tabs are selected (and potentially which filters has been applied, too) when generating dashboard reports (see #19354 ). This PR is API changes requires for this to be possible.\r\n\r\nPrevious attempts (#17749) implemented this feature with only 1 tab being selectable (and highlighted), but will generate multiple screenshots in one report.\r\n\r\nThis isn't ideal---because there would be no way to compose a view where multiple specific tabs are selected (whether nested or not). We want to generate a screenshot where the whole dashboard state is preserved, hence this approach in this PR---the report_schedule.extra saves only one dashboard state at a time (including which tabs are selected, which filters are applied, etc), then we make only one screenshot for each report that corresponds to the specific dashboard state.\r\n\r\nIf users want reports for multiple dashboard tabs, they can create multiple reports---currently we don't allow multiple reports for each user on each report, which we would need to change. This PR only changes the report schedule schema and screenshot generation process. There will be more PRs to follow to fully enable the desired feature.\r\n\r\nFuture TODOs:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Allow users to select tabs in the UI\r\n- [ ] Allow each user to create multiple reports for a dashboard\r\n\r\n#17749 isn't used by the frontend in any way, so it should be safe to just replace it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nWe rely on unit tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds thumbnails to the sidebar of draggable charts in the edit dashboard view and modifies the design of the cards with and without thumbnails enabled.  Thumbnails are shown when the `THUMBNAILS` feature flag is enabled.  If no thumbnail has been generated, the same placeholder that's used on the chart list card view is shown.  Other changes include:\r\n- Layout updates for the text and the `Added` badge, when thumbnails are enabled and when they aren't.\r\n- Text is truncated and shows a tooltip when it's too long to fit in the layout.\r\n- The human-readable chart viz type is displayed instead of the machine-readable name.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/178516532-8830f90c-24fd-441c-a864-47c74b618df8.mov\r\n\r\n**After (thumbnails enabled):**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/178517080-023dd336-7c35-4784-9efb-28c822a1bf08.mov\r\n\r\n**After (thumbnails disabled):**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/178517519-89811718-34e0-4a97-85f3-17f040885f25.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n**Note:** Thumbnail generation is currently broken (see #20673).  In addition, there's a bug preventing the chart metadata from being downloaded (see #20684), so even if thumbnails are generated, any items in the draggable chart list with missing metadata won't show thumbnails either.\r\n\r\n1. Run Superset with feature flag `THUMBNAILS=False` and ensure that the updated cards look and work as expected when added and not added to the dashboard. \r\n2. Run Superset with `THUMBNAILS=True` and ensure that thumbnails appear (or at least that their placeholders do) as expected and that the updated cards look and work as expected when added and not added to the dashboard.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has
