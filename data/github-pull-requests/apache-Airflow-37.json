#31101, I added logic to check for served logs when we did not find either local or remote logs.\r\n\r\nIn #32561, contributor @khrol observed that for a task with multiple tries, if the user was looking at the logs for a non-running try, the UI would show an erroneous and potentially confusing 404 error.  @khrol attempted a fix that would suppress this error message.\r\n\r\nIn #39177, contributor @kahlstrm reported a bug introduced by #32562 and attempted to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe bug was reportedly that “non-running task try logs weren’t shown in the UI for running tasks”.  This I think refers to when you are looking at the logs for a failed attempt. The contributor added, “This is due to us storing the logs on the worker with a Persistent Volume”.  I assume this means that we did not check served logs in that case.\r\n\r\nOne question: why couldn’t the webserver access the PV?  In #39496 same user added more conditions.\r\n\r\n**Problem:** \r\n\r\nWe can't see logs served from triggerer when task deferred.\r\n\r\n**This PR:**\r\n\r\nThis PR essentially restores the behavior to what it was prior to #32561.  So we undo the enhancement in #32561, the first attempted fix #39177, and the second attempted fix #39496.\r\n\r\nThis means that while a task is in running state, if you look at logs for prior failed attempts, you may see a \"checked served logs and did not find any\" message.  This can be mildly confusing but it's more important to restore access to logs.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-05T23:12:42Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T09:37:26Z","closed_at":"2024-08-06T01:29:51Z","merged_at":"2024-08-06T01:29:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"fdda4478e5829c08aa5059f8ad86f92922313d19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769748000,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5NzQ4MDAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:logging","name":"area:logging","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

This happens because we are validating OL metadata returned by extractor, [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/d6bc1f69a36dd0ee08f02fb6e6f0388342f5fb1b/airflow/providers/openlineage/extractors/manager.py#L105). This validation makes sense and we should keep it, but imho the default extractor should return empty data when there is no on_start method defined, because it means that the on_complete method will be called. \r\n\r\nThere is no need to return None ourselves and then log a warning because we found a None 😄 \r\n\r\nSome logs of current behaviour:\r\n```\r\n[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {listener.py:383} DEBUG - Executing OpenLineage process - on_running - pid 376\r\n[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {manager.py:149} DEBUG - extractor for CustomOperator is <class 'airflow.providers.openlineage.extractors.base.DefaultExtractor'>\r\n[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {manager.py:98} DEBUG - Using extractor DefaultExtractor task_type=CustomOperator airflow_dag_id=dag task_id=task airflow_run_id=manual__2024-08-05T15:04:29.761674+00:00 \r\n[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {base.py:101} DEBUG - Trying to execute `get_openlineage_facets_on_start` for CustomOperator.\r\n[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {base.py:112} DEBUG - Operator CustomOperator does not have the get_openlineage_facets_on_start method.\r\n[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {manager.py:104} DEBUG - Found task metadata for operation task: None\r\n[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {manager.py:267} WARNING - Extractor returns non-valid metadata: None\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the change, we would get rid of this warning. We would still get the information that there is no on_start method and metadata found would be `OperatorLineage()`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

Why\r\nEver since https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40693, we have been able to schedule a DAG based on DatasetAlias. When a dataset alias is resolved in a producer DAG for the first time, a consumer DAG that depends on that dataset alias will have to wait for the next round of DAG parsing to realize its dependency on the resolved datasets. Consequently, the consumer DAG will need to wait for the second run of the producer DAG to be triggered.\r\n\r\n## What\r\nThis PR created DDRQ for the consuming dags of dataset alias as well. So after the consumer DAG is updated after DAG parsing, it will have DDRQ which might triggers it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

mini-scheduler raises an exception, it has a bit weird side effect - the task succeeds but it is seen as failed and scheduler gets confused. Also flower celery worker in this case shows an error.\r\n\r\nThis happens for example when DAG contains non-serializable tasks.\r\n\r\nThis PR swallows any exceptions raised in mini-scheduler and simply logs them as error rather than fail the process. Mini-scheduler is generally optional and we are also already sometimes skipping it already so occasional skipping is not a big problem.\r\n\r\nFixes: #39717\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Set the triggerer_health_check_threshold to a small number like 3(s).\r\n2. Make triggerer instances at least 2.\r\n3. Use blocking io like http request in the trigger's run method.\r\n4. Trigger multiple deferred tasks(for our cases: 100+ trigger jobs) in the same time. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

runners on ASF are SLOW to build docs (much slower than\r\nregular public runners) but they have more disk space which is needed\r\nto publish documentation. This PR splits docs building process to two\r\nsteps:\r\n\r\n* First step that builds docs and uploads them as artifacts run on\r\n  public runners\r\n\r\n* Publish step that downloads the artifact and publishes them to\r\n  S3 (this one needs more space and runs on ASF self-hosted runners)\r\n\r\nThis has the nice side effect that docs built in PR are available\r\nas artifacts in PRs and main build.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Airflow running the cleanup_stuck_queued_tasks function on a certain frequency. When we run the airflow on a large Kube cluster (pods more than > 5K). Internally the cleanup_stuck_queued_tasks function loops through each queued task (when they breach task queued timeout) and checks the corresponding worker pod existence in the Kube cluster. Right now, this existence check using list pods Kube API. The API is taking more than 1s. if there are 120 queued tasks, then it will take ~ 120 seconds (1s * 120). So, this leads the scheduler to spend most of its time in this function rather than scheduling the tasks. It leads to none of the jobs being scheduled or degraded scheduler performance.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use single k8 list pods batch api call to get all the worker pod owned by scheduler. Prepare the set of searchable strings using pod annotations. Use this set data structure and identify whether the task associated pod exists or not. This reduces the number kube api sever calls significantly. \r\n\r\nset elements string format:\r\n(dag_id=<dag_id>,task_id=<task_id>,[,map_index=<map_index>],[run_id=<run_id>]\r\n\r\nNote: Switch the

It would be great to have that information in the events already to reduce the time and effort needed for debugging, but only when some flag is turned on explicitly on the user side (f.e. airflow log level is set to debug). This PR adds a DebugRun facet to Airflow, that contains information about all packages and their versions. In the future, we could possibly extend that facet with other useful information.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n\r\n- I'm not sure, if we should add this facet to all events (current implementation), or only add it to some specific events (which?).\r\n- Can we rely on the Airflow logging level when deciding whether or not to attach this facet? I wanted to avoid creating another flag, that would basically had to be set together with DEBUG logging level. (Whenever debugging user issues, we are asking for debug logs anyway)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background:\r\nInitially, I aimed to include package information in the producer field for specific facets but wanted to keep it hassle-free for both users and developers. I created some POC for each solution, but this debug facet seems the best for now.\r\n\r\nWe could automatically track where a facet is created and assign the producer, but the complexity and maintenance effort are not worth it for such a simple feature.\r\n\r\nI also considered resetting the producer for facets after creation using a decorator or function in common.compat provider, but this would require additional code from developers when adding OL support for operators. With hook level lineage coming, it could become even more complex. This is something we might revisit in the future, as having the producer field identify the actual provider of the facet at all times is beneficial (regardless of OL configuration, logging level, etc.).\r\n\r\nFor now, the simple debug facet should suffice.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

Problems\r\n- When a `RedshiftDataOperator` task is configured with `deferrable=True` and `wait_for_completion=True` (the default), it doesn't go in `deferred` state. Instead it stays in `running` state until the statement completes.\r\n- Also, if `wait_for_completion=False` and `deferrable=True`, after the statement is submitted, the task will still go into `deferred` mode and wait for the statement to complete.\r\n\r\n# Reasons\r\n- Currently, if `deferrable=True`, `self.wait_for_completion` is set to `False` in `execute()`, but never used after.\r\n- `execute` does not check whether the task should wait for completion, only if it should be deferred.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n- Overwrite `wait_for_completion` instead of `self.wait_for_completion` when deferrable. Also, remove redundant condition on `self.wait_for_completion`\r\n- Before going into deferrable mode, also check that the task is supposed to wait for completion.\r\n\r\n# How I tested\r\nChecked with this simple DAG that the operator now behaves as expected, for all 4 combinations:\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag\r\nfrom airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.redshift_data

{\"deferrable\": False, \"wait_for_completion\": False},\r\n    }.items():\r\n        RedshiftDataOperator(\r\n            task_id=task_id,\r\n            aws_conn_id=\"redshift_data\",\r\n

noticed that time zone from config (\"default_timezone = Europe/Moscow\") is not taken into account when generating \"run_id\". \r\nAlso \"execution_date\" field is always shown in UTC in Airflow UI, see my screenshots.\r\n\r\nI created this patch to generate \"run_id\" and to display \"execution_date\" in specified default time zone (get \"default_timezone\" option from configuration). \r\nMoreover I call \"coerce_datetime()\" function in api, thus links to task instances will have \"execution_date\" parameter with correct time zone in UI.\r\n\r\nSee other

#41175\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nWe are sub charting the official airflow chart and for this reason we need to use `fullnameOverride: \"airflow\"` settings to achieve the desired k8s resource names. However when we are using it the flower ingress becomes invalid because it want's to connect to non existing service name. Root cause are in the ingress.yaml. The webserver ingress can handle it with no problem.\r\n\r\nIncorrect code section\r\n\r\n`flower-ingress.yaml` - [code section](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/daccc75b064c735636027b20f3edb82da69ffab1/chart/templates/flower/flower-ingress.yaml#L75)\r\n```yaml\r\nspec:\r\n  rules:\r\n    - http:\r\n

correct code section\r\n\r\n`webserver-ingress.yaml` - [code section](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/daccc75b064c735636027b20f3edb82da69ffab1/chart/templates/webserver/webserver-ingress.yaml#L83)\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspec:\r\n  rules:\r\n    - http:\r\n

overcome this issue we need to run this command on every deployment\r\n```bash\r\nkubectl patch ingress airflow-flower-ingress \\\r\n    --namespace \"airflow\" \\\r\n    --type='json' \\\r\n    -p='[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/rules/0/http/paths/0/backend/service/name\", \"value\":\"airflow-flower\"}]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What you think should happen instead\r\n\r\nThe following code should be updated to match how webserver ingress works\r\n`flower-ingress.yaml` - [code section](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/daccc75b064c735636027b20f3edb82da69ffab1/chart/templates/flower/flower-ingress.yaml#L75)\r\n```yaml\r\nspec:\r\n  rules:\r\n    - http:\r\n

idea of passing content of .kube/config file as a dictionary to Triggerer was introduced with the first implementation of deferrable mode in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29017.\r\nLater, due to security concerns related to storing the config file in trigger table this change was reverted.\r\nWith the following change https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38233 that concern has been mitigated and the change (of passing config as a map to the trigger) can be reapplied.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license

when dealing with large amounts of data.\r\nSerializing `polars` can be supported in much the same way as `pandas`. \r\n\r\nHowever, rather than supporting `polars` objects, it may be better to convert them to `pandas` objects.\r\nA `polars` can be converted to a zero-copy `pandas` frame in the following way\r\n```python\r\npd_frame =

trigger is supposed to do the same job as `SageMakerTrigger` but with printing logs. The reasons to deprecate it:\r\n- Printing logs in a trigger does not add much value to the DAG author since logs go to the triggerer and not task logs\r\n- The trigger `SageMakerTrainingPrintLogTrigger` contains some bugs since the operator `SageMakerTrainingOperator` does not work when created with `deferrable=True` and `print_log=True`. The trigger wait indefinitely for the job to complete\r\n- Having two different triggers to achieve the same thing with the only difference one is pushing more logs than the other does not make a lot of sense\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR adds possibility to handle tests that perform task.run call in DB isolation mode. This call is treated specially - i.e. it will be possible for the run() method to use the DB directly. to set up the task but then when _run_raw_task below will use the DB, there will be an error raised.\r\n\r\nThat allows to fix the `test_core.py` and likely a number of other tests that rely on the run() method to run the tests.\r\n\r\nThis required to improve the _set_ti_attrs method to handle dag_run inside the task instance pydantic to task instance mapping - because we are actually using TaskInstance for those tests not TaskInstancePydantic under the hood.\r\n\r\nRelated: #41067\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is a resolution to the given issue #39622. The main bug here was that the hook parameters were not properly given to the SnowflakeSqlAPIHook and then they were not properly assigned. The query execution method of the hook statically assigned configuration from Airflow connection. In this PR it is changed so that:\r\n1. hook_params from SnowflakeSqlApiOperator object is passed into the hook object through unpacking the variable.\r\n2. In SnowflakeSqlApiHook, for each of the parameter (database, role, schema, warehouse) there is a check performed for whether they were provided in the parameters (in their parent class SnowflakeHook, they are initialized to None, hence the if self.database|schema|role|warehouse) and if not, they are taken from connection definition.\r\n\r\ncloses: #39622 \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

PR fixes a bug in counting queries during a DAG file parsing (the feature was implemented in #40323).\r\n\r\nA context manager `count_queries` was implemented previously, and it is responsible for counting queries within its scope. The reason why it was missing some queries and misreporting statistics is that its scope wasn't covering all steps of parsing the DAG file. This PR moves a `count_queries` invocation higher to the level of `DagFileProcessor.process_file()` method, which ensures that all the queries are counted.\r\n\r\nRelates to:

To delete those fields, the user must delete the connection and create a new one. The \"Changed Row\" message displayed after a row is edited is misleading. \r\n\r\nTherefore, as a temporary fix, I have created a warning that always shows when the user is editing a connection form as shown below. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fcbbb58-6841-4783-aaf4-bb65c3002759)\r\n\r\nWhat I tried to do was get the specific fields that were populated and issue a warning with those field names when the user tries to delete them. However, I'm having trouble figuring out how to do that check when the user clicks the 'Save' button. So, I have a warning of the currently populated fields that can be modified but not deleted after the user clicks 'Save' shown below. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26497d9d-0449-4eb6-959a-b184cb6d61cf)\r\n\r\nrelated: #40105 \r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-30T23:37:03Z","updated_at":"2024-08-30T11:54:14Z","closed_at":"2024-08-14T16:05:05Z","merged_at":"2024-08-14T16:05:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7eba1834387a078b61b26b103906b74ad7515dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172802142,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAyMTQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:misc/internal","name":"type:misc/internal","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Misc changes that should appear in change log"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

commit adds the capability to export log messages into XCOM on an optional basis. The existing behavior (no logs) is retained as the default making this an opt-in feature. Users of the operator can retrieve either all logs or only the last log message. In either case, the log messsages are presented as a list\r\n\r\nThe bash and docker operators, among others, can export logs into XCOM to provide some feedback about the outcome of the command in the results. The AzureContainerInstancesOperator just detects if the container exits cleanly and exits with either 0 (success) or 1 (failure). This commit adds the ability to put either the last log message or all log messages into XCOM under the key 'logs' so it can be used in future operators to decide if it the operation within the container failed or succeeded.","created_at":"2024-07-30T22:55:42Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T16:12:29Z","closed_at":"2024-08-14T10:46:07Z","merged_at":"2024-08-14T10:46:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2c9e8cfc00f30f4b3102197c2145c6e44b3d837","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471850767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUwNzY3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:microsoft-azure","name":"provider:microsoft-azure","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Azure-related
