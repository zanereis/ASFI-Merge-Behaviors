The change in this PR just makes DruidOuterQueryRel eagerly 'validate' the subquery by explaining it, so that the exception happens early and the 'is valid' check catches and returns false, which allows the planner to proceed to other plans. \r\n\r\n#12418 tried to address an issue of using alias with outer query with an order by clause. The reason was that during the query explaining part the source relation type was being mismatched. In the first run it was set to the name of the column while in the next run it was set to the alias name. To mitigate the difference we set the Data source of the subquery to use a QueryDataSource from a TableDataSource which introduced the defect shown here. \r\n\r\nTo solve this we move back to the old implementation and added the check for the rowtype with an additional `toDriodQueryForExplain` call that would ensure setting the correct row types. This additional call does not impact performance as the planning time remained almost similar. A run of our benchmarks for planning indicate that they remain in the same ball park.\r\n\r\n**Before this change**\r\n```\r\nBenchmark             (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (storageType)

is a follow-up change to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12207. Even after this PR, we do see issues when enabling cloud storage extensions. E.g. if google cloud extension is enabled, `org.apache.druid.common.gcp.GcpModule#getHttpRequestInitializer` is invoked during task startup. This method fails if the druid cannot find valid google storage credentials. \r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: The Application Default Credentials are not available. They are available if running on Google App Engine, Google Compute Engine, or Google Cloud Shell. Otherwise, the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS must be defined pointing to a file defining the credentials. See https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials for more information.\r\n\tat com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.DefaultCredentialProvider.getDefaultCredential(DefaultCredentialProvider.java:98) ~[google-api-client-1.26.0.jar:1.26.0]\r\n\tat com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.GoogleCredential.getApplicationDefault(GoogleCredential.java:213) ~[google-api-client-1.26.0.jar:1.26.0]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.common.gcp.GcpModule.getHttpRequestInitializer(GcpModule.java:60) ~[druid-gcp-common-xxxx]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMO #12207 pushes the burden of solving this problem down to the extension. I was going to do the same initially but instead opted for a different approach. The underlying problem is that maps are materialized in `OmniDataSegmentKiller`, `OmniDataSegmentPusher` and `OmniDataSegmentArchiver` eagerly. I have changed the implementations of these classes to use `Provider` as values in the map. The `provider.get` is further wrapped inside `Suppliers.memoize` so we create just one instance for each provider. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

[Druid catalog](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12546) provides a collection of metadata \"hints\" about tables (datasources, input sources, views, etc.) within Druid. This PR provides the foundation: the DB and REST layer, but not yet the integration with the Calcite SQL layer. This is a much-refined version of the [earlier catalog PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12647).\r\n\r\nThe DB layer extends what is done for other Druid metadata tables.  The semantic (\"business logic\") layer provides the usual CRUD operations on tables. The entire design is pretty standard and follows Druid patterns. The key difference is the rather extreme lengths taken by the implementation to ensure each bit is easily testable without mocks. That means many interfaces which can be implemented in multiple ways.\r\n\r\nParts available in this PR include:\r\n\r\n* The metadata DB storage layer (in an extension)\r\n* The basic \"catalog object model\" that describes the properties and columns which describe catalog tables.\r\n* A basic set of tables: datasources and three kinds of external tables (inline, local, and HTTP).\r\n* A REST API layer to perform CRUD operations on tables.\r\n* Unit tests\r\n* An integration test of the catalog REST API.\r\n\r\nThe catalog mechanism is split into two parts.\r\n\r\n* The \"core\" part which describes catalog objects, and which is can model data from a variety of catalog systems.\r\n* The `druid-catalog` extension which stores data in the Druid metadata database.\r\n\r\nThis split exists for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* Many metadata systems exist: HMS, Amazon Glue, various commercial solutions, etc. We anticipate that some shops may wish to obtain metadata from these other systems, in the same way that some shops get their security information from external systems.\r\n* Druid's database schema evolution system is rather basic. (And, by \"basic\", we mean \"nonexistent.\") There is some chance that the remaining development will change the schema, which upgrades cannot support. Users who enable `druid-catalog` extension now acknowledge that they are using it only for testing, not production, and at their own risk.\r\n\r\nFunctionality not in this PR, but which will appear in the next one, includes:\r\n\r\n* The synchronization mechanism between the Coordinator and Broker.\r\n* SQL table functions to make use of catalog entries.\r\n* Integration of catalog properties to simplify MSQ ingest statements (`INSERT` and `REPLACE`).\r\n* Integration of catalog schema information with `SELECT` queries.\r\n* The remaining set of external table types.\r\n* Views.\r\n\r\nThis is a great opportunity for reviewers to provide guidance on the basic catalog mechanism before we start building SQL integration on top. Please see the [Druid catalog issue](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12546) for additional details about the goals and design of the catalog.\r\n\r\n### Update 10-17\r\n\r\nAfter much debate, we decided to drop the rollup feature from the catalog. It turns out that \"rollup\" is a feature used for many purposes and more thought is needed to work out how users might want to use the rollup features. Compared to the Catalog proposal, the initial feature won't help with MSQ ingestion of rollup tables: users are empowered to specify on each ingestion how they want those segments to be rolled up.\r\n\r\nA new commit pulls out the portions of the code in support of the proposed, but now dropped, `rollup` datasource type.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] has a design document [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12546).\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors. (Not yet: the functionality is not yet user visible.)\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [X] added

Description\r\n\r\nAdd an extension to allow tasks to be run as k8s jobs from the overlord, eliminating the need for a middle manager.\r\n\r\nThe core changes are as follows: \r\n1. Refactored arguments to CliPeon to be more generic\r\n2. Had to add a setup and cleanup method to AbstractTask.  \r\n\ta. Because tasks run on separate pods, the task needs to setup its own filesystem directories. \r\n\tb. Again because the tasks run on separate pods, we push the task logs from the task itself and task reports. in the cleanup method. \r\n3. A few other small changes to core required for tasks to run independently on their own.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nThe KubernetesTaskRunner runs in the overlord process.  When it has a request to launch a task, it goes to the K8sApi, grabs its own PodSpec (the overlord itself).  Takes that podSpec, modifies the necessary attributes (eg: command, labels, env variables etc).  Takes the task.json, compresses and base64 encodes it.  Then launches a K8s Job.  \r\n\r\nThe K8s Job on startup, will unwrap the task.json env variable, write it to the appropriate directory and run the task. \r\n\r\nThe KubernetesTaskRunner monitors the lifecycle of the task, just as the ForkingTaskRunner and returns the TaskStatus.\r\n\r\n#### What if you are running Sidecars?\r\nThe config option `druid.indexer.runner.sidecarSupport` will support launching sidecars, I utilize kubexit (https://github.com/karlkfi/kubexit) to setup the spec such that when the main container completes, it terminates the sidecars.  This is a known issue with k8s jobs and this is how I work around it.\r\n\r\n#### Another nice side-effect\r\nBecause the launching of tasks has been decoupled from the service itself, the tasks run independently regardless of the state of the overlord process.  You can shut down the overlord process, and when it comes back.  It will go to the k8s api and get the status of all peon jobs regardless of phase (in flight, completed, failed, pending) and will do the proper bookeeping for completed tasks and will resume monitoring tasks in flight.\r\n\r\nTo run a middle manager less druid, simply omit the middle manager from your deployment. \r\n\r\n Make sure you also change `druid.processing_intermediaryData.storage.type=deepStorage`\r\n\r\nIn your overlord config: \r\n\t1. Add the `druid-kubernetes-overlord-extensions` to your extensions load list.\r\n\t2. `druid.indexer.runner.type=k8s`\r\n\t3. `druid.indexer.runner.namespace=<currentNamespace>`\r\n\t4. `druid.indexer.queue.maxSize` controls max concurrent tasks, you must set it to a value less than the default of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`\r\n\t5. `druid.indexer.task.encapsulatedTask=true` \r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests. (this has been added but the k8s integration tests only work on a linux machine as they use `conntrack` with minikube.  Thus I will have to let travis run and figure things out from there.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-29T21:46:44Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:14:37Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T02:44:48Z","merged_at":"2022-11-03T02:44:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"e5ad24ff9f1ea0169ca492283da84e6f1563a754","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\nWhen a Kafka stream becomes inactive, i.e., no new data arrives, and all existing data is read, there is no need for Supervisor to create new indexing tasks. \r\n\r\n- Supervisor fetches current offsets every `tuningConfig.offsetFetchPeriod` (default - 30 sec) and compares them with latest offsets (fetched every `ioConfig.period` (default - 30 sec)) for lags. If the stream is inactive for `dataSchema.ioConfig.idleConfig.inactiveAfterMillis`, then supervisor state is turned to IDLE. (See conf section)\r\n- When Supervisor is in idle state it just doesn't create any new indexing tasks. \r\n- This temporary IDLE state is cleared when supervisor is restarted e.g. updated spec. \r\n- While the supervisor is in this temporary idle state, Supervisor will continue to check for any changes in the latest offsets (or if lag is > 0). If activity in the stream is detected again, then supervisor will come out of its IDLE state into RUNNING and resume creating indexing tasks.\r\n\r\nPlease note the initial delay before new data is ingested from when new data enters into the stream is the frequency of offsets fetch (30 sec) + initial warmup time to create new indexing tasks.\r\n\r\n#### How current offsets fetching work:\r\nCurrent offsets are fetched from running, publishing tasks for the partitions available and for the rest of the partitions from the metadata storage.\r\n\r\n### Configuration changes\r\n- `dataSchema.ioConfig.idleConfig`\r\n   - `enabled` - If true Supervisor goes into idle state when stream is inactive. The default value is false. \r\n   - `inactiveAfterMillis` - Minimum time interval to wait until stream is considered inactive/idle. The default value is 600,000 millis.\r\n- Adds new State - `IDLE` - to Basic states of Supervisor.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n * `KafkaSupervisor`\r\n * `KafkaSupervisorIOConfig`\r\n * `SupervisorStateManager`\r\n * `IdleConfig`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes CVE-2022-34917\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

Description\r\n\r\nThis adds min/max functions for CompressedBigDecimal. It exposes these\r\nfunctions via sql (BIG_MAX, BIG_MIN--see the SqlAggFunction\r\nimplementations).\r\n\r\nIt also includes various bug fixes and cleanup to the original\r\nCompressedBigDecimal code including the AggregatorFactories. Various null\r\nhandling was improved.\r\n\r\nAdditional test cases were added for both new and existing code. Other tests common\r\nacross sum,min,max were refactored also to share the various cases.\r\n\r\nIt's largely copy-and-paste with refactors into base classes for any triple that exists for all \r\nthree functions.  The major changes are in the *CompressedBigDecimal classes to do \r\nmin/max, setValue(), and initialize to max/min to do min/max calculations\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CompressedBigDecimaSumAggregatorFactory`\r\n * `CompressedBigDecimalMaxAggregatorFactory`\r\n * `CompressedBigDecimalMinAggregatorFactory`\r\n * `CompressedBigDecimal`\r\n * `ArrayCompressedBigDecimal`\r\n * `ByteBufferCompressedBigDecimal`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Guice refactoring, the injectors are built differently, having the ability to have or not have modules required for a class. HadoopTask uses the injector to create an instance of `ExtensionsLoader` which contains the `ExtensionsConfig` class. However, the modules in the injector are insufficient to supply the properties passed to the druid server to the `ExtensionsConfig` (POJO), due to which irrespective of the Druid's config, it will get instantiated with the default properties.\r\nThis PR fixes the injector so that the `ExtensionsConfig` is instantiated properly.\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nTo be added\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `HadoopTask`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

for checking the in-filter values in a column dictionary we use a binary search per value in the set. That works well for smaller value-sets but starts slowing down as the number of values in the set increase. To accommodate for large value-sets arising from large in-filters or from joins being pushed down as in-filters, we use sorted merge algorithm for merging the set and dictionary for larger values.\r\n\r\nThe following benchmark was run to find the cutoff point :\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark     (dictionarySize)  (filterToDictionaryPercentage)  (selectivityPercentage)  Mode  Cnt        Score

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR adds a new `KafkaConfigOverrides` extension point, which defines an interface for a `configOverrides` object in the Kafka supervisor spec's IOConfig. This interface allows an extension to provide an implementation that if defined in the supervisor spec, gets access to the Kafka consumer properties map, and can return a freely modified version of the consumer properties. \r\n\r\nThis is useful for extensions that do operations such as removing forbidden consumer properties from being set, or adding additional consumer properties (such as referencing an external secrets manager for sensitive properties).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

HTML tags in docs is tricky business markdown is in general a bit overloaded as a concept.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it ok to write `<br>` to mean the tag and also to write `<n>` to mean the number? How is the compiler to know what you want?\r\n\r\nI went through the docs and scanned them with an [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) parser that detects issues like these. I want to make this part of an automated check, but for now I want to merge this PR that fixes real bugs in the docs currently.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes I made here show up in the docs as actual rendering bugs:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1078\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/190934548-2d588e6e-2bb2-4e41-adcf-c9a502485397.png\">\r\n\r\nUsually text that is meant as user visible text gets treated as an html tag.\r\n\r\nI want to share this tip with anyone writing docs in markdown:\r\n\r\nSay you want to talk about something that is written in `<` and `>` like `Promise<void>` and have it render correctly. You can either put in in backticks (``` ` ```) to make it ca code block - but if you do it make sure that text in backticks is all on one line or you can escape the `>` to make it not a tag, so write it as `Promise<void\\>` in the markdown (escaping the `<` does not do anything useful).

item (1) in #12881 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of segment balancing often leads to over-replication.\r\n\r\nThis can happen in the following (fairly common) scenario:\r\n- Segment is moving from server A to B for balancing\r\n- Load succeeds on B, callback is invoked to finish the move\r\n- If inventory view shows the segment loaded on B, drop on A is invoked\r\n- If inventory view for B is not updated yet, the drop on A is not invoked\r\n\r\nThis is a frequent occurrence but under normal circumstances, it is not noticeable\r\nbecause load rules quickly drop the over-replicated segment from A. But if load rules get\r\nstuck for some reason (e.g. trying to reach target replication levels on a different tier),\r\nthe number of over-replicated segments keeps increasing, thereby overloading historicals.\r\n\r\n![over_replication](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18635897/183566987-6b3a2be9-05cc-4f70-9e4f-3da9796e2710.png)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. For http loading, do not check the server inventory to determine if the drop should be invoked.\r\nThe HTTP response status is enough to determine load success or failure.\r\n2. For zk-based loading,\r\n    - continue to check the inventory because behaviour of zk loading is a little more error prone\r\n    - remove path check in the callback as it is redundant given that the inventory is already being checked\r\n    - some minor cleanup in the peon\r\n3. Fix the corresponding test in `SegmentLoadingNegativeTest`\r\n\r\n#### Main classes to review:\r\n- `LoadPeonCallback`\r\n- `DruidCoordinator`\r\n- `CuratorLoadQueuePeon`\r\n- `HttpLoadQueuePeon`\r\n- minor refactor in `BalanceSegments`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-18T11:36:40Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:16:08Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T06:36:23Z","merged_at":"2022-09-29T06:36:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce5f55e5ce00d876277424ea0724b70a330315b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":632425053,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MzI0MjUwNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Balancing/Coordination","name":"Area

we move forward with the catalog and other projects, it has become clear we need a SQL query test structure which is a bit more flexible than the current \"Calcite tests.\"\r\n\r\n### Test Case File\r\n\r\nThe revised framework, inspired by the one used by Apache Impala, uses \"test case\" file to define the test inputs and expected outputs. Each \".case\" file contains one or more test cases, each of which has one or more sections. The file uses a somewhat unusual syntax to avoid the need to quote JSON or SQL. (It would seem to be more of a \"Druid fit\" to use JSON, but imagine the complexity of quoting SQL that contains JSON within a JSON-formatted file.)\r\n\r\nA typical test case looks like this:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n==============================================================\r\nConverted from testSelectConstantArrayExpressionFromTable()\r\n=== case\r\nSELECT constant array expression from table\r\n=== SQL\r\nSELECT ARRAY[1,2] as arr, dim1 FROM foo LIMIT 1\r\n=== options\r\nsqlCompatibleNulls: \"both\"\r\nvectorize: true\r\n=== schema\r\narr INTEGER ARRAY\r\ndim1 VARCHAR\r\n=== plan\r\nLogicalSort(fetch=[1])\r\n  LogicalProject(arr=[ARRAY(1, 2)], dim1=[$2])\r\n    LogicalTableScan(table=[[druid, foo]])\r\n=== native\r\n{\r\n  \"queryType\" : \"scan\",\r\n  \"dataSource\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"table\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"foo\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"intervals\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"intervals\",\r\n    \"intervals\" : [ \"-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z\" ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"virtualColumns\" : [ {\r\n    \"type\" : \"expression\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"v0\",\r\n    \"expression\" : \"array(1,2)\",\r\n    \"outputType\" : \"ARRAY<LONG>\"\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"resultFormat\" : \"compactedList\",\r\n  \"limit\" : 1,\r\n  \"columns\" : [ \"dim1\", \"v0\" ],\r\n  \"legacy\" : false,\r\n  \"granularity\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"all\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n=== results\r\n[\"[1,2]\",\"\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe structure has multiple sections as described by the `syntax.md` file in this PR. The primary sections are `sql`, which defines the query, and `results` which defines the expected output as a set of JSON lines. The other sections allow validating other parts of the query process such as the logical plan, the output schema, the Druid native query and so on.\r\n\r\nThe `context` section specifies any additional query context items to include in the query. The `options` section provides instructions to the test framework itself, such as whether to run a query vectorized or not.\r\n\r\n### Scope of This PR\r\n\r\nThis PR includes only the test case definitions: both for for the expected values (parsed from a \".case\" file), and an actual query run. This PR does not yet include the mechanisms to run the cases. That mechanism is dependent on various other in-flight PRs and will arrive in a future PR. This PR allows us to establish the case file format itself which can be used in both Calcite unit tests and new ITs.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-17T02:55:08Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T20:43:23Z","closed_at":"2022-10-18T18:24:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03cf96380e9c36bd7813c19c00d023507b975096","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR improves `NestedDataColumnSerializer` to no longer explicitly write null values to the field writers for the missing values of every row, instead moving passing the row counter to the field writers so that they can backfill null values in bulk if they haven't been written to for some number of rows.\r\n\r\nUsing an extreme example of a nested column with a dataset having 1 row with ~9000 nested paths and 999,999 rows with ~10 paths, prior to this patch ingestion took ~30 minutes and after takes ~5.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

JsonInputFormat is used for streaming ingestion, if the input string contains multiple JSON events, but there is a parse exception occurs, all events in the record will be discarded, even if some events were valid (see https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10383)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following:\r\n- A `assumedNewlineDelimited` option for JsonInputFormat that can be used when the input is known to be newline-delimited JSON. This will force the input format to create a `JsonLineReader`, which can parse lines independently, so that a parse exception on one line will not prevent other valid lines from being ingested.\r\n- A `useJsonNodeReader` option for JsonInputFormat. If true, instead of creating a `JsonReader`, the input format will create a new `JsonNodeReader` for parsing multi-line JSON. This new parser splits an input string into `JsonNode` objects and parses them one by one into `InputRow`. This allows valid events found prior to a parse exception to be ingested. Potentially valid events after invalid JSON syntax is encountered will still be ignored. This also prevents valid JSON events with an unparseable timestamp from causing other events in the same input string to be discarded.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

However, this functionality was previously not made clear in the documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * None\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Motivation\r\nThere are a number of use cases that require “flattening” records when processing. The need for this is exemplified in the existed of MVDs, which basically have a native “flattening” built-in. Other SQL systems can also do similar behaviors, they expect an ARRAY type of data and then you put that into a FLATTEN or UNNEST or other operator and it “explodes” out one new row for every value in the array.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe need to implement a similar operator for Druid. This dove-tails a bit with some of the recent work done for handling arrays in Druid. Essentially, the operator would take in an array and then “flatten” the array into N (N=number of elements in the array) rows where each row has one of the values from the array.\r\n\r\n### Related Work\r\nThe inspiration for using unnest as a data source comes from ([Work with arrays  |  BigQuery  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/arrays) )  where unnest has been used as a data source. Clickhouse also has a flatten functionality ([Array Functions | ClickHouse Docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/array-functions/#arrayflatten) ) but that does not transform a dataset by adding more rows. Since for our use case, unnest can be used with dateExpand functionality (coming after unnest) we model unnest as a data source similar to Bigquery. \r\n \r\n### Methodology\r\n**Refactoring** \r\n\r\nThe underlying principle here is an operation on a data source that works on a segment and creates additional rows. Joins have a similar principle where the number of rows can be more than the input table after the join operation. The current framework supports that in the following way:\r\n\r\nHaving a join data source, alongside a factory and then a specialized wrapper ([JoinableFactoryWrapper.java](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/join/JoinableFactoryWrapper.java) ) around it which creates a function to transform one segment into another by the notion of a segment function.\r\n\r\nHave a separate implementation of segment reference through  [HashJoinSegment.java](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/join/HashJoinSegment.java) which uses a custom storage adapter to access a cursor to the segment for processing.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to move out the creation of the segment map function from outside the wrapper to individual datasources. In cases where the segment map function is not an identity function (in case of join and also for unnest) the segment functions can be created accordingly for each data source. This makes the abstraction generic and readily extendable to other datasources we might create in future (e.g flatten)\r\n\r\nThe changes here:\r\n\r\n1. Creation of a segment map function moved into each data source\r\n2. Code refactored from `JoinableFactoryWrapper` to `JoinDataSource`\r\n3. PlannerContext was updated with an additional `JoinableFactoryWrapper` object during this process\r\n4. Several test cases were updated with the change to the `JoinDataSource`\r\n5. Some Guice injector things were updated as a part of the process, additionally nullables need not be bound to CliRouter using noops now\r\n6. New testcases for broadcast join in MSQ\r\n7. `getCacheKey` method updated to move inside each data source\r\n\r\n**New changes** (will be in a followup)\r\n\r\nAfter the new abstraction is in place, the following needs to be done for unnest\r\n\r\n- Have a separate UnnestDataSource class that deals with unnest\r\n- This should have it’s own segment map function\r\n- A separate UnnestSegment with a custom storage adapter to gain access to cursor in each segment\r\n- Design of the native query for Unnest considering we also need to  pass the column(s) to unnest\r\n- Finally, the SQL query that maps to the native query\r\n\r\nEach of these development phases should be backed by unit tests/ integration tests as applicable\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes some issues encountered with nested column objects with key names containing newlines or commas, which while valid JSON, are not cool with the way the `meta.smoosh` file currently works.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this, the smoosh file now escapes commas and newlines when writing the `meta.smoosh` file, and unescapes them upon mapping.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an issue with the jsonpath and jq parsers when handling empty keys, which are also valid JSON property names. They were both a bit overly strict, and now should allow them if contained in syntax appropriate quotes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] been

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

PR moves some of the ITs for JRE 11 runtime to the cron stage. The reason is simple - we have a lot of tests and our PR checks take too long to finish. This would improve the situation slightly. I have kept the following ITs around\r\n - query integration test (so we at least check the whole ingestion and querying end-to-end on runtime 11)\r\n - security integration test, leadership integration test, query integration test (mariaDB) - I kept these around since they involve another service like a zookeeper. There are no unit tests with the MariaDB driver. The same goes for TLSCertificateChecker.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

#12822 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe framework proposed here make it easy to write tests that verify the behaviour and interactions\r\nof the following entities under various conditions:\r\n- `DruidCoordinator`\r\n- `HttpLoadQueuePeon`, `LoadQueueTaskMaster`\r\n- coordinator duties: `BalanceSegments`, `RunRules`, `UnloadUnusedSegments`, etc.\r\n- datasource retention rules: `LoadRule`, `DropRule`\r\n\r\nThe framework provides the ability to:\r\n- recreate varied cluster setups\r\n- run simulations that can cycle through several coordinator runs quickly\r\n- verify results of the simulation using emitted metrics, cluster state and inventory view\r\n- modify the state of the simulation during a run: cluster, segments, retention rules, etc.\r\n- use multiple execution modes: immediate/lazy segment loading, immediate/lazy inventory sync\r\n- write new tests with no additional mocking\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\nThe changes here are slightly different from what was originally proposed,\r\nmostly in terms of how each coordinator cycle is invoked.\r\n\r\n1. __Execution__: A tight dependency on time durations such as the period of a repeating task\r\nor the delay before a scheduled task make the setup precarious and the tests flaky. It also makes\r\nit difficult to reproduce certain situations. All the executors required for coordinator operations\r\nhave thus been given only two possible modes here:\r\n    - immediate: direct execution on the calling thread\r\n    - blocked: tasks kept in a queue until explicitly invoked. Time-based verifications can still be\r\n    done in this mode by simply invoking the tasks at the required time\r\n2. __Actions__: The proposal discussed performing cluster actions at the end of each coordinator\r\nrun. But the results of these actions were unreliable due to race with tasks submitted by the run,\r\nsay loading a segment. With the above modes of execution, it is now possible to perform actions\r\nreliably in our tests and recreate any race condition without getting stuck in one ourselves!\r\nFor example, a sequence of steps could be to: run coordinator, load one segment from queue,\r\nsync inventory, load remaining segments from queue and verify the final state.\r\n3. __Dependencies__: There is minimal mocking in the framework and new tests need not mock\r\nanything at all. There are some test implementations that provide desired behaviour for\r\nexecutors and metadata store.\r\n4. __Inventory__: The coordinator maintains an inventory view of the cluster state. Simulations can\r\nchoose from two modes of inventory update - auto and manual. In auto update mode, any change\r\nmade to the cluster is immediately updated in the coordinator view.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAdd the following main classes:\r\n- `CoordinatorSimulation` and related interfaces to dictate behaviour of simulation\r\n- `CoordinatorSimulationBuilder` to build a simulation.\r\n- `CoordinatorSimulationBaseTest`, `SegmentBalancingTest`, `SegmentLoadingTest`\r\n- `BlockingExecutorService` to keep submitted tasks in queue and execute them\r\n  only when explicitly invoked.\r\n\r\nProvide mocked dependencies to the `DruidCoordinator` for:\r\n- `JacksonConfigManager`\r\n- `LookupCoordinatorManager`\r\n\r\nProvide test dependencies to the `DruidCoordinator` for:\r\n- `SegmentsMetadataManager`: keeps a list of used segments in memory\r\n- `HttpClient`: sends segment load requests to respective historicals\r\n- `MetadataRuleManager`: keeps rules in memory and allows for update during simulation\r\n- `ServerInventoryView`: allows synchronization with the current cluster state in the sim\r\n- `ScheduledExecutorFactory`: to create direct or blocked executors and keep a handle to them\r\n\r\nSome of these test dependencies can later be consolidated with existing utility classes.\r\n\r\n### Negative tests\r\n\r\nSome of the issues identified using this framework have been put together as negative\r\ntests in `SegmentLoadingNegativeTest`.\r\nOnce the underlying issues are fixed as detailed out in #12881 , these tests can be rectified\r\nand moved to the regular `SegmentLoadingTest` class.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

The run notice cannot be completed as it is waiting on the lock, and the graceful shutdown notice is queued after the run notice. This always leads to a forced termination of the supervisor after the supervisor's graceful shutdown period.\r\nThis PR adds an additional check before getting the lock to see if the supervisor is STOPPING to prevent unnecessary lock contention.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) `maybeSetState` is called by the RunNotice and may set the state to something other than STOPPING when called again after the supervisor has begun stopping. This would prevent the changes made above from taking effect after subsequent runs.\r\nA supervisor once in STOPPING state must remain in it. Any operation to update or remove it first removes and then creates a new supervisor, so there is no need for further state transition handling in this case.\r\nThis also needs to be synchronized to prevent races from multiple threads leading to an incorrect supervisor state, particularly when one of them tries to set it to STOPPING while the others attempt to set it to a different state.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

context revision which builds on the work started in [PR #13022](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13022). \r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n\r\nMost of the work in this PR is transparent to users. This PR includes [Issue #13120](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/13120)  which introduces a user-visible change. We introduce two new configuration keys that refine the query context security model controlled by `druid.auth.authorizeQueryContextParams`. When that value is set to `true` then two other configuration options become available:\r\n\r\n* `druid.auth.unsecuredContextKeys`: The set of query context keys that *do not* require a security check. Use this for the \"white-list\" of key to allow. All other keys go through the existing context key security checks.\r\n* `druid.auth.securedContextKeys`: The set of query context keys that *do* require a security check. Use this when you want to allow all but a specific set of keys: only these keys go through the existing context key security checks.\r\n\r\nBoth are set using JSON list format:\r\n\r\n```text\r\ndruid.auth.securedContextKeys=[\"secretKey1\", \"secretKey2\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou generally set one or the other values. If both are set, `unsecuredContextKeys` acts as exceptions to `securedContextKeys`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Druid defines two query context keys which always bypass checks because Druid uses them internally:\r\n\r\n* `sqlQueryId`\r\n* `sqlStringifyArrays`\r\n\r\n#### Backward Compatibility\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading Druid, if query context security is disabled (`druid.auth.authorizeQueryContextParams=false`, the default) then you will see no change.\r\n\r\nIf query context security is enabled (`druid.auth.authorizeQueryContextParams=true`), then the two keys listed above will always be allowed, regardless of any security rules that may have been set. You can remove these two keys from your rules if you have added them.\r\n\r\nThe two new config values (`unsecuredContextKeys`, and `securedContextKeys`) will not be set in your configuration (or in the default configurations) and will thus behavior after an upgrade will not change. You can, however, shift context key security rules you have set for all users into the new `unsecuredContextKeys` config property.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nRecent work uncovered two issues with the way Druid handles query contexts:\r\n\r\n* #13049 fixes a race condition with JDBC updates\r\n* #13022 fixes type-unsafe value conversions\r\n\r\nDuring the investigation of the above it became clear that the semantics around the query context are a bit unclear and could be improved.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the current `QueryContext` class promises more than it can deliver. It groups context values into three groups: default, system values and user values. Splitting up the values was done to allow authorizing just the user-provided keys. However, this didn't quite work as intended for several reasons. First, most code does not recognize this format, and instead \"merges\" all three maps before making additional changes. Second, the only use of the user-provided values is to authorize them, something that can be done more simply via other means. Third, the concept of \"user-set\" keys is incorrect: keys set *may* come from the user, or may come from an application or the Router.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the `QueryContext` class creates confusion rather than tidying things up as was intended. The tidying up requires that we pull in [Issue #13120](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/13120) to resolve a context key security ambiguity.\r\n\r\n### Overview of Revisions\r\n\r\nThis PR achieves the desired goals in a simpler way, while unifying the many ways that the code currently works with the query context.\r\n\r\n* The original three-map `QueryContext` is replaced by a \"facade\" on top of a single map.\r\n* The original `QueryContext` was created to allow authorizing user context keys. This PR solves that issue by making a copy of the keys separate from the context, allowing the SQL engine to modify the context without creating conflicts with the security feature.\r\n* Uses of `QueryContext` to fetch values are replaced with a reference the new `QueryContext` class as a facade.\r\n* Modification to the context in the planning layer occurs directly on the context map; it is no longer done via the old `QueryContext` class since there is no real value in creating a layer on top of the map.\r\n* #13022 adds a number of type-safe method to the `Query` interface. However, doing so clutters up that interface, and we still need the `QueryContexts` methods to get at specific context values. See the discussion in #13022 for details. This PR, by contrast, puts all context access methods on the revised `QueryContext` facade, making for cleaner code.\r\n* All type-unsafe context value accesses were replaced in #13022. They are replaced again here by the new `QueryContext` type-safe methods.\r\n* The old type-unsafe methods are marked deprecated. No code in Druid-proper references them, though we must assume that extensions may continue to use them.\r\n* All specific methods in `QueryContexts` which take a `Query` or context map parameter are replaced by methods on the revised `QueryContext` class.\r\n* `QueryContexts` methods which rewrote a query moved to the `Queries` class.\r\n* Validation of a context value now reliably throws a `BadQueryContextException` with a clear explanation of the problem. Previously, we threw both `BadQueryContextException` and `ISE` for such errors, and the errors have variations in format and wording.\r\n* `get` methods are standardized. `get<Type>()` without a default returns a boxed value, or `null` if the value is not set. This allows code to implement logic of the form \"if the value is set, do something with the value, else do something else.\"\r\n* `get(defaultValue)` methods return an unboxed value, since they will return the default if the value is unset.\r\n* `DruidPlanner` is refactored a bit to better handle context key security.\r\n* `AuthConfig` implements the enhanced context key security model.\r\n\r\n### Specifics\r\n\r\nThe original `QueryContext` class was first removed: all references to that class were modified to refer to the context map instead.\r\n\r\nA new class of the same name was created. The only creator of the new class is `Query.queryContext()`. The new class holds onto the context map associated with the query, and provides the many type-safe and value-specific methods. Since `QueryContext` is simply a facade, it is cheap to create an instance as needed. This lets us convert code of the form:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nlong foo = QueryContexts.getAsLong(query, FOO_NAME, FOO_DEFAULT);\r\nlong bar = QueryContexts.getBar(query);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo\r\n\r\n```java\r\nlong foo = query.queryContext().getLong(FOO_NAME, FOO_DEFAULT);\r\nlong bar = query.queryContext().getBar();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a bit of code makes multiple references to context values (as above), we can also do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nQueryContext queryContext = query.queryContext();\r\nlong foo = queryContext.getLong(FOO_NAME, FOO_DEFAULT);\r\nlong bar = queryContext.getBar();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following methods in `Query` are marked deprecated:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface Query... {\r\n @Deprecated\r\n  <ContextType> ContextType getContextValue(String key);\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  <ContextType> ContextType getContextValue(String key, ContextType defaultValue);\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  default boolean getContextBoolean(String key, boolean defaultValue);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough the above methods are deprecated, they are reimplemented as `default` methods. As a result, the methods of the same names are removed from subclasses since they are redundant.\r\n\r\nThe `Query.getQueryContext()` method is removed as a way of marking that the old `QueryContext` is no longer available. The old method didn't really even work: the different context types were lost when merging into a single map. A new `queryContext()` method returns the facade version. \r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nThe discussions in #13049 and #13022 suggested other alternatives:\r\n\r\n* Work only with the context map and the `QueryContexts` methods as shown above. This works fine, and is one of the steps taken in #13049 that lead to this PR, but is a bit cumbersome.\r\n* Add methods to the `Query` method as in an early draft of #13022. Doing so clutters the `Query` interface, and does not help in the SQL layer where we work with contexts before the native `Query` is created. Unless we really want to clutter the `Query` interface, we'd still need the value-specific methods in `QueryContexts`.\r\n* Leave well enough alone: status quo. While the existing code works, as noted above, the semantics are a bit messy which creates confusion for readers. Tidying up the code has no benefit to the computer, but is helpful for us poor humans who have to understand the code.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe result is a solution that:\r\n\r\n* Solves the authorization issue that gave rise to the original `QueryContext`\r\n* Solves the synchronization issue with `QueryContext` by avoiding multiple maps.\r\n* Builds on the type safety solution of PR #13022 by shifting the methods to `QueryContext`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] has been validated using existing tests.\r\n- [X] has modified unit tests as needed to reflect changed methods, exceptions and semantics.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Use streaming ingestion to create a non-empty interval in a datasource.\r\n2. Suspend supervisor\r\n3. Compact this datasource without appending to existing data\r\n4. Resume supervisor and suspend supervisor to add data to this interval (optional)\r\n5. Drop all segments in this interval\r\n6. Resume supervisor to ingest more data in this interval\r\n7. Query data for this interval\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Reason for the occurrence of the issue -->\r\n\r\n#### Behaviour\r\n\r\nSegment allocation creates a shardSpec with (version, shardNumber, numCorePartitions).\r\n\r\nFor newly created shardSpecs, the segment corresponding to the highest (version, shardNumber) is chosen from the set of both used and pending segments and `numCorePartitions` for newly assigned segments is assigned using the value corresponding to the chosen \"max segment\".\r\n\r\nWhile version and shardNumber are monotonically increasing with ingestion, numCorePartitions may change due to certain operations (For example when all core segments are dropped as described above)\r\n\r\nWhen the \"max segment\" belongs to the pending segment set and core partitions have been dropped, an incorrect (non-zero) value would be considered for numCorePartitions.\r\n\r\nSubsequent queries would not be processed as the interval is supposed to have non-zero core partitions according to this incorrect shard spec, but there aren't any.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n#### Patch\r\n\r\nThe numCorePartitions must be chosen using the \"max segment\" in the set of used, non-overshadowed segments.\r\nThis can be done by choosing `numCorePartitions` early from the set of used segments in the VersionedIntervalTimeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nIn the current version of MSQ, workers are bound to a specific task. This is not cool for a fault tolerant engine where worker tasks can be ephemeral, and not bound to a specific task id, and can be respawned.in case the task they are bound to fails.\r\nThis PR introduces a set of changes and reactors which makes the following possible:\r\n1. WorkerClient uses workerNumber instead of taskId to communicate between the workerTasks, abstracting away the complexity of resolving the workerNumber to the taskId from the callers. \r\n2. Since the worker-client during the fault-tolerant mode of execution should always read from the durable storage, once it writes it's outputs to the durable storage, it will add a file with __success in the worker no's output directory for that stage and with its task id (IFF it is not present already). This allows the readers to figure out the worker which has successfully written its outputs to the durable storage and will allow it to differentiate from the partial outputs that might have crept in by orphan/failed worker tasks.\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

long and double value columns are now written directly, at the same time as writing out the 'intermediary' dictionaryid column with unsorted ids\r\n* remove reverse value lookup from GlobalDictionaryIdLookup since it is no longer needed\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR improves nested column serializer heap usage and write performance by modifying the serializer to write the long and double value columns for the nested fields on the \"first\" pass though the data, which is building the local dictionaries for the nested fields while writing out the 'raw' JSON-smile encoded column. This is a change from the current version, which writes out the value columns on the \"second\" pass, where it sorts the local dictionary for each field and writes out the new dictionaryid int column, builds bitmap indexes, and writes the column itself.\r\n\r\nMaking this change eliminate the need of the 'reverse' value lookup for long and double values in `GlobalDictionaryIdLookup`, and so they have been removed. Besides eliminating this from memory, it also saves a value lookup per row per column to write the long and double value columns.\r\n\r\nI haven't measured this at all yet, but naively I assume it should be a fair bit more chill in practice to do things this way.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

[#12955](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12955), [#12739](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12739).\r\n\r\nEnsures that JDBC makes a copy of the `QueryContext` stored on a connection when creating statements. Doing so avoids race conditions which produced flaky results in `DruidAvaticaHandlerTest.testConcurrentQueries()`.\r\n\r\nAn earlier version of this PR first took a hack approach. @gianm correctly pointed out that the problem is really with a flaw in JDBC. A second version explored the alternative of replacing `QueryContext`. That is a good idea, and expands on work that @FrankChen021 started in #13022, but was overkill for the specific problem in question. The refactoring was moved to a new PR, #13071. In the end, the simplest fix was good enough, and is safe, so this PR presents just that minimal fix.\r\n\r\nThe fix was verified by running `testConcurrentQueries()` many times in a loop until it failed due to an OOM. That OOM is a separate issue to be addressed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-07T22:52:33Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T06:04:07Z","closed_at":"2022-09-12T17:27:56Z","merged_at":"2022-09-12T17:27:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"80b97ac24dde0fe2ca1ff2d3a3156182b30de451","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area
