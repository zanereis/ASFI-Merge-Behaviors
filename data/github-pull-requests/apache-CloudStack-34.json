We already implemented and used this feature in our platforms. We thought it might be useful for the community too. \r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are as small as adding some fields and the setter/getter method. Although the database changes might seem scary, they are minor changes. Except defining the `add_created_column_in_domain_and_account` procedure, I only added the following lines in `account_view` and `domain_view`. Generally speaking, in the mentioned procedure, I added the `created` column to the `account` and `domain` tables, and I ignore its creation if they have already existed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n`account`.`created` AS `created`,\r\n...\r\n`domain`.`created` AS `created`,\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces new granularity levels to configure VM dynamic scalability. Previously VM is configured to be dynamically scalable based on the template and global setting. Now we bringing this option to configure at service offering and VM level also.\r\n\r\nVM can dynamically scale only when all flags are ON at VM level, template, service offering and global setting. If any of the flags is set to false then VM cannot be scalable. This result will be persisted in DB for each VM and will be honoured for that VM till it is updated.\r\n\r\nWe are introducing 'dynamicscalingallowed' parameter with permitted values of true or false for deployVM API and createServiceOffering API.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the API parameter changes:\r\ncreateServiceOffering API: \r\n          dynamicscalingenabled: an optional parameter of type Boolean with default value “true”.\r\ndeployVirtualMachine API: \r\n          dynamicscalingenabled: an optional parameter of type Boolean with default value “true”.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the UI changes:\r\nService offering creation has ON/OFF switch for dynamic scaling enabled with default value true.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3348673/106704083-76e30a00-6611-11eb-9df7-c94960505732.png)\r\n\r\nDeploy VM wizard has ON/OFF switch for dynamic scaling enabled with default value true in Advanced Mode section.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3348673/106704992-0dfc9180-6613-11eb-9c15-e237a68dd5ac.png)\r\n\r\nAdded a documentation PR to support these changes\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/186\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nFollowing are the test cases that I've covered as part of my testing on VMware environment.\r\n\r\n**VM Creation:**\r\n\r\n1. Created VM with Small service offering with all Flags ON \r\n            - VM1 (scalable)\r\n2. Created VM with Small service offering which is not dynamic, with Dynamic Scaling Enabled _true_ on VM\r\n            - VM2 (not scalable)\r\n3. Created VM with Small service offering, with Dynamic Scaling Enabled _false_ on VM \r\n            - VM3 (not scalable)\r\n4. Created VM with Small service offering which is not dynamic, with Dynamic Scaling Enabled _false_ on VM\r\n            - VM4 (not scalable)\r\n5. Created VM with Small service offering with all dynamic flags ON except template \r\n            -  VM5 (not scalable)\r\n\r\n**VM Update:**\r\n\r\n1. Stop VM1 => set Dynamic Scaling Enabled to _false_ => Update VM\r\n            - VM is updated to Dynamic Scaling Enabled value _false_\r\n2. Stop VM2 or VM3 or VM4 or VM5 => set Dynamic Scaling Enabled to _true_ => Update VM\r\n            - VM update operation fails because VM cannot be scaled with any of the template/service offering/global setting dynamic scaling enabled flag with _false_\r\n\r\n**VM dynamic Scaling:**\r\n\r\nWhile trying to scale VM from UI, it will only list service offering that are suitable to scale and also offering with \"Dynamic Scaling Enabled\" value same as old service offering.\r\n\r\n1. Create Big Service Offering with Dynamic Scaling Enabled _true_\r\n            - SO1\r\n2. Create Big Service Offering with Dynamic Scaling Enabled _false_\r\n            - SO2\r\n3. Scale VM1 (scalable) to Service Offering SO1\r\n            - Successful\r\n4. Scale VM1 (scalable) to Service Offering SO2\r\n            - Operation failed because, VM1 Service Offering is marked Dynamic Scaling Enabled but not on SO2\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to create thick and sparse disks using VMWare\r\n\r\nA global variable (disk.provisioning.type.strictness) has been added to select if disk provisioning types will be strictly adhered to, meaning if a storage pool is not capable of creating the specific disk provisioning type, the pool will not be selected for the creation of the volume.\r\n\r\nStoragePool capabilities are determined when the pool is added to Cloudstack and a new API is added ( updateStorageCapabilities(poolId) ) to update the hardware acceleration capability of storage pools if needed. \r\n\r\nDoc PR here: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/217\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed.

have been added and manual tests have been done using NFS without hardware acceleration and an ISCSI datastore.\r\n\r\nCreate a thin/sparse/thick disk/service offering, set the global var to true, depending on the offering selected, the disks should be created in the correct storage pool with the correct disk provisioning type.\r\n\r\nIf the global var is set to false, the disk will be created in any storage pool and if the pool supports the disk provisioning type it will be used, otherwise thin will be selected.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that expunging vm will remove dhcp entries of another vm in VR\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n(1) create two vm wei-001 wei-002, and wei-003 start them.\r\nAssume that wei-001 has the biggest ip (order by char, not number. for example 192.168.0.99 > 192.168.0.100)\r\n\r\n(2) check /etc/cloudstack/dhcpentry.json and /etc/dhcphosts.txt in VR\r\nThey have entries for all vms\r\n\r\n(3) stop wei-002 and wei-003, then restart VR (or restart network with cleanup).\r\ncheck /etc/cloudstack/dhcpentry.json and /etc/dhcphosts.txt in VR\r\nThey

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that update capacity for hosts take long time if there are many service offerings.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n(1)Create 10000 service offerings (by db changes or cloudmonkey).\r\n\r\n(2) Check the total time of periodical capacity check in cloudstack.\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, it spend 2.5 seconds (2 hosts)\r\n```\r\n2021-01-15 16:10:12,793 DEBUG [c.c.a.AlertManagerImpl] (CapacityChecker:ctx-5d5f3b3b) (logid:f5eb68ba) Running Capacity Checker ...\r\n2021-01-15 16:10:15,287 DEBUG [c.c.a.AlertManagerImpl] (CapacityChecker:ctx-5d5f3b3b) (logid:f5eb68ba) Done running Capacity Checker ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this patch ,it spend 1.3 seconds (2 hosts)\r\n```\r\n2021-01-15 16:12:43,604 DEBUG [c.c.a.AlertManagerImpl] (CapacityChecker:ctx-a2a7f3f1) (logid:f7e0a4c5) Running Capacity Checker ...\r\n2021-01-15 16:12:44,927 DEBUG [c.c.a.AlertManagerImpl] (CapacityChecker:ctx-a2a7f3f1) (logid:f7e0a4c5) Done running Capacity Checker ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there are 100 hosts, the total time will be reduced from 100+ seconds to around 10 seconds.\r\nThis helps a lot to reduce the execution time of prometheus exporter.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an issue that crops up during API discovery when we have the same API name pointing to 2 command classes, namely, xxxCmdByAdmin and xxxCmd. \r\nDuring api discovery we create a map of the apiNames and their corresponding parameters, however, in cases of api's like _createNetwork_ which point to both CreateNetworkCmd and CreateNetworkCmdByAdmin classes, though in [ManagementServerImpl](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/server/ManagementServerImpl.java#L2720) care has been taken to place the xxxCmdByAdmin classes after the regular xxxCmd classes, since we copy this list of command classes into a HashSet, is so happens, that sometimes the xxxCmdByAdmin Classes get discovered before their generic counterpart. Hence, parameters defined in the xxxCmdByAdmin class gets overwritten. This can be easily fixed by ensuring that the order of the API classes is maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nCases when this can be seen:\r\nThis issue becomes predominant in the new UI as we use discovered API parameters to define the form fields:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10495417/105023276-c4d40b80-5a70-11eb-80d4-42baf031ce35.png)\r\n\r\nAlso,when logged in as admin via cmk and after doing a sync, listing params of createNetwork sometimes doesn't list the parameters defined in the CreateNetworkCmdByAdmin class - e.g., vlan, bypassoverlapcheck, etc\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) SBCM5> > create network -h\r\ncreateNetwork: Creates a network\r\nRequired params: displaytext, name, networkofferingid, zoneid, \r\nAPI Params               Type     Description\r\n==========               ====     ===========\r\naccount                  string   account that will own the network\r\naclid                    uuid     Network ACL ID associated for the network\r\n                                  \r\nacltype                  string   Access control type; supported values are\r\n                                   account and domain.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when move a vm from an account to another account.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue\r\n(1) create a vm with multiple shared networks (in  advanced zone, or advanced zone with security groups)\r\n(2) create another account (in same domain who can also access the shared networks)\r\n(3) move vm to new account, with a list of networkid\r\n\r\nexpected result: the vm has nics on the networks in same order as specified in API request, and nics have the same ips as before\r\nactual result: network order is not same as specified, ips are changed.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of

Description\r\n\r\nImproves logic for selecting ROOT disk for VM to be imported when VM has multiple disks.\r\nBased on user input of parameter - datadiskofferinglist, a check will be performed if user correctly provided disk offering mapping for n - 1 disks (one less than the total number of the disks). Remaining one disk will be considered as the ROOT disk.\r\nThis will allow correct ROOT disk being selected when first disk in the list of disks of listUnmanagedInstance API or list returned by vSphere SDK is not the ROOT disk.\r\n\r\nFixes #4547 \r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE

However, registerTemplate [already supported https](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/463aa9044ac49f39ffc9a60b088dc8e66b4e3f72/server/src/com/cloud/api/commands/RegisterTemplateCmd.java#L79),

Description\r\nOn KVMHAMonitor, when there is an inconsistency on the heartbeat's file or heartbeat timeout is extrapolated several times, the host is restarted. The host restarting amid several operations might bring inconsistency problems; therefore, it is interesting to let operators choose if they want the host restart or not on the hearbeat's timeout or storage errors. \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize the heartbeat reboot configuration on KVMHAMonitor. The default value is `true`; therefore, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on [PR#4585](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/4585).\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functioanlity)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally on a test lab.\r\n1. On agent, I changed my log4j to debug mode.\r\n2. I added `hearbeat.update.timeout=10` setting to `agent.properties` to force a timeout on hearbeat.\r\n3. I added `reboot.host.and.alert.management.on.hearbeat.timeout` setting to `agent.properties` and changed it some times;\r\n4. I restarted agent and watched the log.","created_at":"2021-01-14T17:50:11Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T04:06:00Z","closed_at":"2021-08-24T04:06:00Z","merged_at":"2021-08-24T04:06:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"83c0b61ab20236592181ca9f6786274c0d335c90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":821716113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjE3MTYxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:cleanup","name":"type:cleanup","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1391968610,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzkxOTY4NjEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:Minor","name":"Severity:Minor","color":"906666","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2556649634,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTU2NjQ5NjM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/complexity:normal","name":"complexity:normal","color":"8465f2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/16","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16/labels","id":5714156,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTcxNDE1Ng==","number":16,"title":"4.16.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":460,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-30T05:24:55Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T06:54:13Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2021-11-10T02:02:01Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/4586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/4586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/4586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/088941c6e896cbccbd17afc3272b9d0139b9405f","head":{"label":"GutoVeronezi:externalize-kvm-agent-storage-reboot-configuration","ref":"externalize-kvm-agent-storage-reboot-configuration","sha":"088941c6e896cbccbd17afc3272b9d0139b9405f","user":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.gi

Description\r\nOn KVMHAMonitor, the heartbeat timeout is hardcoded to `60000` ms; therefore, operators do not have options to choose which timeout they want/need. \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize the heartbeat timeout configuration on KVMHAMonitor.\r\n\r\nDepending on the use case, this timeout might need increasing/decreasing. Therefore, it is interesting to externalize such configurations for cloud operators. The hardcoded value is taken as the default one. Therefore, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functioanlity)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally on a test lab.\r\n1. I changed my log4j to debug mode.\r\n2. I added and changed `hearbeat.update.timeout` setting to `agent.properties` file several times.\r\n3. I restarted agent and watched the

Description\r\nSome servers (like [microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/prepare-tls-1.2-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide)) are deprecating TLSv1 and TLSv1.1. \r\n\r\nOn Quota's mailing settings, ACS uses the protocol `TLSv1`; therefore, operators do not have options to choose which version they want to use. \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize the protocol setting on Quota's mailing.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally on a test lab.\r\n\r\n1. I had Enabled Quota's plugin on the management server and configured it to use Gmail's SMTP server.\r\n```\r\nserver address: smtp.gmail.com\r\nusername: gmail address\r\npassword: gmail password\r\nport (TLS): 587\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. On `Quota - All Accounts`, I added 10 credits to my user and set 20 as min balance.\r\n\r\n3. I had added an gmail address to Accounts > \\<account\\> > Users - Email.\r\n\r\n4. I allowed `Less secure app access` on my Google account.\r\n\r\n5. I had restarted management server.\r\n\r\n6. And I called `quota update` API via Cloudmonkey. \r\n\r\n7. In Gmail, we have an option to `show original` message, which provides the TLS version and the cipher. So I changed the configuration some times and sent some alerts to verify if both versions, in configuration and gmail, are the same.","created_at":"2021-01-12T11:46:48Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T11:15:13Z","closed_at":"2021-02-24T11:15:13Z","merged_at":"2021-02-24T11:15:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"31771186fa46ca205a3d07d46bb27d4e3932dccd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1391968610,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzkxOTY4NjEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:Minor","name":"Severity:Minor","color":"906666","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2531618875,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTMxNjE4ODc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/complexity:simple","name":"complexity:simple","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"a

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently in upgrade cloudstack checks the systemvm template after db changes.\r\nif user do not install systemvm template and uprgade cloudstack (for example install packages with newer version), upgrade will fail. in this case it will be very complicated to rollback the db if there is no db backup.\r\n\r\nThis pr checks the latest (only the last) systemvm template in upgrade

Description\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behavior functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\nNumbers are great for computers, however, we (humans) deal better with names. Logging host's ID is good in terms of short messages; however, admins must know all hosts by their ID or look via DB/API queries to figure out which host the log message is pointing to.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes an admin friendly approach for log messages by logging the host name instead of its ID.\r\n\r\nAn example of how it works currently log messages can be painful in large environments:\r\n\r\n`Operation Failed vm's original host id: 334 new host id: 300 host id before state transition: 127`\r\nVs.\r\n`Operation Failed vm's original host: node23.clusterA new host:

Description\r\nOn Quota's mailing settings, ACS has a configuration (`quota.usage.smtp.useAuth`) to inform if it will use secure SMTP authentication when sending emails.\r\nHowever, this configuration only refers to use SSL or not. Operators haves no option to choose if they want to use StartTLS.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to add support to StartTLS on Quota's mailing settings.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to highlight that this enhancement would be able to solve issue #2625 (if it was applied in that setting as well); however, to reduce the scope of change, this one focuses only on Quota's mailing configuration.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIt has been tested locally on a test lab.\r\n\r\n1. I had Enabled Quota's plugin on the management server and configured it to use Gmail's SMTP server.\r\n```\r\nserver address: smtp.gmail.com\r\nusername: gmail address\r\npassword: gmail password\r\nport (TLS): 587\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. On `Quota - All Accounts`, I added 10 credits to my user and set 20 as min balance.\r\n\r\n3. I had added an gmail address to Accounts > \\<account\\> > Users - Email.\r\n\r\n4. I allowed `Less secure app access` on my Google account.\r\n\r\n5. I had restarted management server.\r\n\r\n6. And I called `quota update` API via Cloudmonkey. Without the new option being introduced here, I would see an error in the management server. After setting it, everything is fine, and the alert email is

Description\r\nWe noticed that sometimes migration in KVM fails due to a latency to move the VM process (domain) from the source host to the target. This has been noticed in Rhel7 and CentOS7. An exception can be observed due to the default (hard-coded) timeout that is extrapolated and ACS can't find the migrated VM's domain in the target host.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize that option in the KVM agent configuration. Default timeout will remain 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking

Description\r\nThe bus type to `data disk` volumes is hardcoded to `virtio` or `scsi`, when using virtio-scsi (or, based on the template type). Therefore, there is no way to specify the bus type to data disk volumes (as we have for root disks). \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to replicate the `rootDiskController` behavior to `dataDiskController`, allowing the definition of the controller.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking

Description\r\n`Qemu 2.10 added the requirement of a --force-share flag to 'qemu-img info' command when reading information about a disk that is in use by a guest`. After this Qemu release, to obtain the attached disk metadata, we need to use a flag to force information reading.   \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to add the required flag to the `qemu-img info` command if the qemu version is 2.10+. We can get the Qemu version in the LibvirtConnection.\r\n\r\nFixes: #4024\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

Description\r\nKVM has a limitation to modify instances definitions while they are on running state. Therefore, it is not possible to change volumes backend location easily.\r\n\r\nThere is a problem in the `migrateVolume` API. This API command ignores that limitation and causes an inconsistence on the database. ACS processes the migrate command, copies the volume to the destination storage, modifies the database and finishes the process with success. However, the running backend is still using the \"old volume file\".\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to prevent KVM to perform volumes migrations while KVM instances are in the running state and inform the user of an alternative API command that enables such operation on running instances.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

Description\r\nThis fix address the issue when CloudStack does reverse look up for guest OS type read from OVF to guest OS type in CloudStack during VMware template registration. After reading the OS type from OVF and while trying to map in CS, currently the first in the list of guest_os_hypervisor table with guest os name is picked and assigned to template. This cannot be true always as there are cases that multiple entries in guest_os_hypervisor table can be of different versions of same OS or it can also be different types of OS as well (in case of types like Other 32bit or otherGuest)\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3348673/102697670-9ab6e000-425d-11eb-84ce-4baca41c08ba.png)\r\n\r\n\"otherGuest\" os name in OVF file can map to guest_os_id either to \"85\" or \"60\". But these two are completely different OS types and there chances that wrong guest OS is marked to template. \r\n\r\nWe are trying to fix the problem using the description field of the OS in OVF file and equals ignore match with display name in guest_os table. If description field is not present or if it does not match with any of guest os display names, then last in the list of guest_os_hypervisor table is picked so that latest version of that guest OS is assigned to the template.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [x] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nTested registering a template with different types of OSes in OVF file.\r\n1. OVF file containing osType: darwin18_64Guest\r\n           - CS maps to single entry in guest_os_hypervisor table and OS type is assigned to \"macOS 10.14 (64 bit)\"\r\n2. OVF file containing osType: \"otherGuest' and Description: \"(other 32-bit)\"\r\n           - CS maps to two entries in guest_os_hypervisor table, but based on description it assigned to \"other 32-bit\"\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3348673/102721080-7ff87000-431e-11eb-9828-86cfc951df8c.png)\r\n\r\n3.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at fixing the issue caused when:\r\n- download a Volume (such that there is a record in the volume_store_ref table)\r\n- migrate the same volume from one primary store to the another\r\nWhen migrating between primary storage pools ACS temporarily copies the volume to the secondary store and then copies it from there to the destination primary store and then the secondary store volume directory is cleared up and the volume (volumes table) is marked as Expunged. BUT the corresponding volume's secondary store record(created when we downloaded the volume) still appears to be ready\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by clearing all records on the secondary store corresponding to that volume and also enhances the garbage collection logic to delete any volumes that were marked as Expunged but have entries in the volume_store_ref table.\r\n\r\nObservations made:\r\nEntries in volume_store_ref after downloading the volume and initiating migration:\r\n```\r\n*************************** 2. row ***************************\r\n                  id: 113\r\n

time, but to run “pip install \" at install time, because these installation packages are updated frequently and should not be limited to a lower version by cloudstack.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a global setting migrate.vm.across.clusters to indicate whether vm can be live migrated to other clusters.\r\n\r\nIf vm is running on the last host in a cluster and vm cannot be migrated to other clusters, put host to maintenance will fail.\r\n\r\nThis is based on pr #4378 \r\n\r\nThis fixes #3707 #3720 \r\n\r\nSome rules\r\n(1) for vmware, across-cluster migration of vms with cluster-scoped pools is supported\r\n(2) for other hypervisors except vmware, vm can be live migrated to other clusters (with same hypervisor type), if all volumes are in zone-wide storage pool.\r\n(3) migration of systemvms (CPVM, SSVM) is only possible across clusters in same pod to avoid potential network issues.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour

Description\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/3788\r\n\r\nWhen a VR is deleted and a new one brought up it populates the dhcphosts.txt with all hosts in the network, but the dnsmasq.leases file is blank which can cause issues if VMs try to renew their lease.\r\nThis PR also adds an entry in the dnsmasq.leases file for each host when the dhcphosts.txt file is populated\r\nAn existing lease when a VM tries to acquire a new one doesn't seem to cause any issues\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n1. Create a network with a couple of VMs on them\r\n2. Restart the network with cleanup\r\n3. Wait for the new router to come up\r\n4. Cat /var/log/dnsmasq.log to verify that no DHCP request has been made\r\n5. Check out /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases\r\n\r\n#### /var/log/dnsmasq.log - No DHCP requests received\r\n```\r\nroot@r-8-VM:~# cat /var/log/dnsmasq.log\r\nDec 10 13:01:44 dnsmasq[928]: started, version

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a regression issue in #4497 \r\n\r\nIn cloudstack 4.14 or before, the cpu topology is set only when cpucore per socket is set (to 4 or 6).\r\nin other conditions, there is no cpu topology in vm xml definition.\r\n\r\nwith #4497, vm will have cpu topology in its xml definition, if cpucore per socket is not set.\r\n```\r\n    <topology sockets='<vm cpu cores>' cores='1' threads='1'/>\r\n```\r\nNot sure if it causes any issue. I think it would be better not to add this part in vm xml definition if cpucore per socket is not set.\r\n\r\nfyi, in https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#cpu-model-and-topology, it says\r\n```\r\ntopology\r\nThe topology element specifies requested topology of virtual CPU provided to the guest. Four attributes, sockets, dies, cores, and threads, accept non-zero positive integer values. They refer to the number of CPU sockets per NUMA node, number of dies per socket, number of cores per die, and number of threads per core, respectively. The dies attribute is optional and will default to 1 if omitted, while the other attributes are all mandatory. Hypervisors may require that the maximum number of vCPUs specified by the cpus element equals to the number of vcpus resulting from the topology.\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL -

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an error that appears when you try to add a new host. I don't even understand why there was a cast to String in the first place. I will assume some classes send HypervisorType and some send a string (empty or otherwise). Shouldn't this be addressed to use the same type everywhere? With this fix adding a new xenserver host works fine.\r\n\r\nHere is the stack trace:\r\n\r\n> WARN  [c.c.s.StorageManagerImpl] (AgentTaskPool-6:ctx-90ed1f24) (logid:77e97d5e) Unable to setup the local storage pool for Host[-4-Routing]\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: class com.cloud.hypervisor.Hypervisor$HypervisorType cannot be cast to class java.lang.String (com.cloud.hypervisor.Hypervisor$HypervisorType is in unnamed module of loader org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppClassLoader @3f69b166; java.lang.String is \r\nin module java.base of loader 'bootstrap')\r\n        at org.apache.cloudstack.storage.datastore.lifecycle.CloudStackPrimaryDataStoreLifeCycleImpl.initialize(CloudStackPrimaryDataStoreLifeCycleImpl.java:135)\r\n        at com.cloud.storage.StorageManagerImpl.createLocalStorage(StorageManagerImpl.java:627)\r\n        ...\r\nINFO  [c.c.u.e.CSExceptionErrorCode] (AgentTaskPool-6:ctx-90ed1f24) (logid:77e97d5e) Could not find exception: com.cloud.exception.ConnectionException in error code list for exceptions\r\nWARN  [c.c.a.m.AgentManagerImpl] (AgentTaskPool-6:ctx-90ed1f24) (logid:77e97d5e) Monitor LocalStoragePoolListener says there is an error in the connect process for 4 due to Unable to setup the local storage pool for Host[-4-Routing]\r\nINFO  [c.c.a.m.AgentManagerImpl] (AgentTaskPool-6:ctx-90ed1f24) (logid:77e97d5e) Host 4 is disconnecting with event AgentDisconnected\r\nWARN  [c.c.r.ResourceManagerImpl] (AgentTaskPool-6:ctx-90ed1f24) (logid:77e97d5e) Unable to connect due to\r\ncom.cloud.exception.ConnectionException: Unable to setup the local storage pool for Host[-4-Routing]\r\n        at com.cloud.storage.StorageManagerImpl.createLocalStorage(StorageManagerImpl.java:640)\r\n        ...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.cloud.hypervisor.Hypervisor$HypervisorType cannot be cast to class java.lang.String (com.cloud.hypervisor.Hypervisor$HypervisorType is in unnamed module of loader org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppClassLoader @3f69b166; java.lang.String is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap')\r\n        at org.apache.cloudstack.storage.datastore.lifecycle.CloudStackPrimaryDataStoreLifeCycleImpl.initialize(CloudStackPrimaryDataStoreLifeCycleImpl.java:135)\r\n        at com.cloud.storage.StorageManagerImpl.createLocalStorage(StorageManagerImpl.java:627)\r\n        at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n        ... 35 more\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [x] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nCreate a basic cloudstack development build (more or less following the installation guide, no oss), try to add a new host with **local storage** (I assume any virtualization type, but the code itself is fishy.
