We've been seeing gobblin-core failures on Travis. It seems related to aws-java-sdk-1.7.4 being needed by hadoop-aws . It seems like the artifact was being pulled from jcenter rather than Maven Central and there might be an issue with the former. I've reordered the repositoriy registration so Maven comes first.\n- I think I've finally figured out an issue with intermittently failing :gobblin-compaction:test . MRCompactorJobRunnerFilenameRecordCountProviderTest was creating a directory under source code tree which was confusing gradle. Moved the directory to /tmp/\n- Added log4j configuration for gobblin-rest-server tests to write test output to /tmp/gobblin-rest-server-test.log . Hopefully that helps with intermittent failures.\n\n@abti can you review

Hive Avro to ORC publish to use Gobblin constructs instead of Hive exchange partition query: \n- Hive exchange partition query was being used to move partitions from staging to final table\n- However, this can fail queries in flight because the current model overwrites data location\n- To overcome this, we have changed the publish module to use Gobblin constructs \n\nNew publish works as follows: \n- Staging table partition is created in a directory under Gobblin control (dir name prefix is derived from source partition location string; such as if partitionDir.prefixLocationHint is set to 'hourly,daily' and 'hourly' exists as substring in source partition path, then 'hourly' string is prefixed to dir name of the partition) \n- At the time of publish, first the staging partition directory is moved as ORC final table sub directory (if previously any dir existed, its deleted; however here hourly / daily hint helps)\n- Previous partition is dropped if any from the destination table, and new partition is created with new partition directory location\n- Old partition directory (if different) is left over for retention to clean up\n\nAlso, other minor changes: \n- Each staging partition gets it own staging table \n- Code refactoring

**Changes**\n\nThis pr creates a way to automatically generate documentation for configuration keys used in gobblin.\nEvery configuration key defined should be annotated with `@ConfigKey` annotation. The tool automatically reads the Javadoc associated with this key. All the config keys and docs are finally written to an HTML file.\nThe tool uses java's doclet APIs to get Javadoc as compiled jars do not have comments or Javadocs. It extends gradle's Javadoc task with custom doclet. The task name is `generateConfigDocs` defined in `gobblin-distribution`. The HTML is generated using Apache `FreeMarker` templates\n## **Supported attributes**\n\nA `ConfigKey` has the following attributes and all of them are optional.\n- Doc - Javadoc\n- IsRequired - true/false\n- Default - Default value for this config key\n- Group - The group this key belongs to. Like Retention, Distcp etc.\n## **Files**\n- `ConfigKey` is the annotation that needs to be added to every `private static String KEY_NAME=\"key.something\"` that has to be documented\n- `ConfigWikiGenerator` is the custom doclet class that scans all classes for fields annotated with `ConfigKey` and writes them to an HTML file (currently /tmp/configDocs.html)\n  -``configDocs.ftl` is the Freemarker html template \n## **Examples**\n\nThe `ConfigWikiGenerator` has some example configuration keys that are annotated with `ConfigKey`.

Introduction\n\nThis PR enables Gobblin to run in cluster mode on AWS via a new sub-module called `gobblin-aws` \n- `gobblin-aws` provides support to launch and run Gobblin cluster on AWS \n- `gobblin-aws` inherits from `gobblin-cluster` to make use of its abstraction wrapping Helix clustering capabilities \n- `gobblin-aws` performs all AWS resource management activities and provides for other critical cluster management capabilities not already provided by `gobblin-cluster` such as: High Availability, Elasticity and Failover\n## Architecture\n\n![gobblin-on-aws-architecture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69499/16608965/e094b320-4304-11e6-8352-a4d6a7031d25.png)\n### AWS Cluster Launcher\n\n`gobblin-aws` is launched using `GobblinAWSClusterLauncher` which upon bootup launches a few services: \n- `AWSClusterSecurityManager` to authenticate with AWS and refresh credentials at configured intervals\n- `AWSSdkClient` to coordinate with AWS and launch various resources \n\nAfter this, the `GobblinAWSClusterLauncher` computes the cloud-init scripts as well as AWS LaunchConfigurations and requests AWS to launch two `AutoScalingGroups*`:\n- Master `AutoScalingGroup` to launch and manage EC2 instances for `GobblinAWSClusterMaster` \n- Workers `AutoScalingGroup` to launch and manage EC2 instances for `GobblinAWSTaskRunner` \n### Master AutoScalingGroup\n\nWhen an EC2 instance under Master `AutoScalingGroup` boots up, it executes the master cloud-init script that:\n- First, creates a `NFS` server and setups work environment on the node (eg. creating all relevant directories) \n- Second, launches a java application to run `GobblinAWSClusterMaster` with relevant classpath and JVM arguments \n\nThe `GobblinAWSClusterMaster` upon bootup: \n- Registers itself as HelixController for the cluster\n- Launches a few services:\n- 1. `AWSJobConfigurationManager` that runs on configured frequency and polls for new or updated job configurations from S3\n- 2. `GobblinHelixJobScheduler` that schedules discovered new or updated jobs for execution\n### Workers AutoScalingGroup\n\nWhen n-number of EC2 instances under Workers `AutoScalingGroup` boot up, they execute worker's cloud-init script that: \n- First, mounts the `NFS` shared directory by master and setups work environment on the node\n- Second, launches a java application to run `GobblinAWSTaskRunner` with relevant classpath and JVM arguments \n\nThe `GobblinAWSTaskRunner` upon bootup: \n- Registers itself as a HelixParticipant in the cluster \n- Registers `GobblinHelixTaskFactory` to listen to Helix and process any tasks \n\n**AutoScalingGroup**\\* `AutoScalingGroup` is a service provided by AWS in which:\n- Users can specify minimum, maximum and desired number of instances\n- Scaling criteria based on which `AutoScalingGroup` automatically launches new instances or shuts them down to scale for load OR launch new instance if any instance dies. \n\nNote: \n1. When new instance launch, they execute the configured cloud-init script and hence register themselves as master or workers\n2. `AutoScalingGroup`s help us achieve HA and Elasticity for load \n### Execution Model\n\nGobblin cluster on AWS makes use of Helix [Distributed Task Execution Framework](http://helix.apache.org/0.7.1-docs/recipes/task_dag_execution.html) to schedule and run jobs. \nFor each Gobblin job run: \n- The `GobblinHelixJobScheduler` on Master node starts a `GobblinHelixJobLauncher` that wraps the Gobblin job into a `GobblinHelixJob` and each Gobblin Task into a `GobblinHelixTask`, which implements the Helix's Task interface so Helix knows how to execute it \n- The `GobblinHelixJobLauncher` on Master node then submits the job to a Helix job queue named after the Gobblin job name, from which the Helix Distributed Task Execution Framework picks up the job and runs its tasks through the live participant worker nodes \n## Upcoming / Pending\n- Replace `NFS` with `EFS` which recently went into GA \n- Multi master support for master HA \n- Support for spot instances \n- More hooks for auto scaling rules / parameters \n- Task execution JVM isolation (though this needs to be baked into `gobblin-cluster` )\n- `AMI` for AWS to bootup from a pre-baked Gobblin instance \n- Process watcher daemon running on all nodes (master and workers) to restart `GobblinAWSClusterMaster` and `GobblinAWSTaskRunner` process JVMs if they die \n## Running Gobblin-on-AWS\n\nFollow these steps to run Gobblin-on-AWS \n- Build Gobblin as you build today, and extract the distribution tar.gz \n- Modify `conf/aws/application.conf` as described later in `Configuration` section \n- Replace secret and access keys with dummy values in `application.conf` and upload it on S3 \n- Launch Gobblin cluster on AWS by running: `bin/gobblin-aws.sh start` \n\nA private key file with pem extension should be saved on the disk, you can use this to ssh into Master and Worker nodes as you would in any regular instance on AWS \n### Configuration\n\nGetting started with Gobblin on AWS is easy. Only the following configurations need to be changed in `conf/aws/application.conf` :\n\n```\n# Cluster name\ngobblin.aws.cluster.name=GobblinAWSPullRequest\n\n# Zookeeper connection string\n# Note: You can use the example below, but the example Zookeeper may or may not be available\n# Example: gobblin.cluster.zk.connection.string=\"ec2-54-149-223-115.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2181\"\ngobblin.cluster.zk.connection.string=\"ec2-54-149-223-115.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2181\"\n\n# AWS Credentials\ngobblin.aws.service.access=\"<AWS Access Key>\"\ngobblin.aws.service.secret=\"<AWS Secret Key>\"\n\n# Leave as-is for sample wikipedia pull job\n# -- OR --\n# Specify S3 URI for job configuration:\n# Steps to obtain this URI:\n#1. Create a S3 folder in a bucket, say the bucket name is \"s3bucket\" and folder is \"/gobblin-confs/job-conf/\"\n#2. Zip your pull files in a zip and upload to this folder. Say your zip file name is myPullFiles.zip\n#3. Specify S3 URI for this zip file in the config below\n#    For the description above: \"https://s3-region.amazonaws.com/s3bucket/gobblin-confs/job-conf/myPullFiles.zip\"\ngobblin.aws.job.conf.s3.uri=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gobblin-libs/job-config/wikipedia.zip\"\n\n# Specify S3 URI for cluster configuration\n# Steps to obtain this URI:\n#1. Create a S3 folder in a bucket, say the bucket name is \"s3bucket\" and folder is \"/gobblin-confs/cluster-conf/\"\n#2. After editing this application.conf: upload this application.conf, log4j-aws.properties and quartz.properties to\n#    /s3bucket/gobblin-confs/cluster-conf/\n#    Note: Make sure to replace AWS credential values with dummy values.\n#          We don't read AWS credentials from application.conf in S3\n#3. Specify S3 URI for this folder in the config below\n#    For the description above: \"https://s3-region.amazonaws.com/s3bucket/gobblin-confs/cluster-conf/\"\n# Example: gobblin.aws.master.s3.conf.uri=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gobblin-libs/cluster-config/\"\ngobblin.aws.master.s3.conf.uri=\"https://s3-region.amazonaws.com/s3bucket/gobblin-confs/cluster-conf/\" \n```\n## Notes\n- **Logs** for master and workers are saved in a common directory in `NFS` and are available in real time\n- All classes in this PR have been marked with `Alpha` tag, although they have been tested thoroughly several times \n- No change is required in the way `Metrics` or any jobs are configured \n- More documentation will follow in Wiki PR

Changes\n1. Added support for nested and flattened orc conversion configuration in `ConvertibleHiveDataset`\n2. The `ConvertibleHiveDataset` supports any number of destination conversion formats each with it's own `ConversionConfig`. <br>\n3. A `ConversionConfig` has a `destinationTableName`, `destinationDbName`, `destinationDataPath` and a few optional configs like `numBuckets`, `clusterBy`, `runtimeHiveProps`\n4. The constructor of `ConvertibleHiveDataset` takes in a dataset Config which MUST have a comma separated list of destination formats at key, `destinationFormats`\n5. `ConversionConfig` for a format can be set by using this destination format as prefix.\n6. E.g. If `destinationFormats=flattenedOrc,nestedOrc` <br>\n   The destination table name for flattened ORC is set at `flattenedOrc.tableName`<br>\n   And the destination table name for nested ORC is set at `nestedOrc.tableName`\n\nDesign doc - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IH9XzY93wiDf6-rzRuFuC6KZSOufulpQSCP5O9eSUUU/edit#heading=h.q4hfu3do5xv3\n\n**Enable both flattened ORC and Nested ORC conversion for a dataset**\n\n<pre>\nhive.conversion.avro : {\n  \n  ## Both flattened and nested are enabled for this dataset. \n  ## (This can be any format string.

Many users try to get started with Gobblin by building the code (e.g. `./gradlew build`), then un-tarring the resulting `gobblin-distribution.tar.gz` file, and then running the Wikipedia example\n  - Many of them fail to get the build working, or have problems running the tests\n- Most of our documentation suggests getting started with Gobblin by first building it (e.g. the `README.md` and Getting Started Guide both suggest this)\n- However, users should just be using the releases here: https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/releases rather than building the latest code themselves\n- This PR updates the `README.md` file and a few other docs to encourage first time users to use the releases rather than building the code themselves\n- I also uploaded the `gobblin-distribution.tar.gz` file for the latest release (0.7.0)\n  - Going forward I think each release should also have the `gobblin-distribution.tar.gz` file attached, so that users can download it directly rather than building it

OracleSource.java and OracleExtractor.java with heavy inspiration from MySqlSource.java and MySqlExtractor.java.\n\nThe classes are largely the same as the MySql ones with the exception of getSchemaMetadata() which needed to be modified to account for Oracle reserved words such as format and comment. Also timestamp formats had to be slightly refactored.\n\nFurther different strategies for handling primitive values like booleans in Oracle needed to be accounted for. This resulted in overriding getSchema(). The only difference is that Oracle treats booleans as varchar2(1). I created a simple casting utility castToBoolean() which I added to SqlQueryUtils.java.\n\nSince getSchema requires use of the private static final Gson factory from JDBCExtractor. I created a getter for access. It is accessed in OracleExtractor's getSchema() method like so: this.getGson()\n\nI am able to successfully complete table_append and table_full jobs using this new source and extractor. I did a clean assemble, and it did not break the build. I believe I stayed consistent with documentation and coding format.\n\nPlease consider my pull request, and let me know if I need to change anything.\n\nThanks!\nBrian Vanover\n\nP.S. One thing is that in order to use the Oracle source and extractor, ojdbc6.jar must be added as a dependency. I simply copied the jar into goblin-dist/lib, but it may be worthwhile to add it as a dependency. I just wasn't sure how to modify the build scripts to include it.

But by setting `hive.dataset.configPrefix` only configs with this prefix is passed to the `HiveDataset`'s``` `datasetConfig`.<br>\n\n**Some Example**<br>\n**a.

of hive retention. It uses `HiveCleanableDatasetFinder` to find `HiveCleanableDataset`. Each `HiveCleanableDataset` will contain `HiveTablePartitionVersions`. If a table is not partitioned, it will be single version. Otherwise, it will contain partitions as versions. \nCurrently, there are two retention policies. One is `HiveTablePartitionInvalidDataLocRetentionPolicy`, which is based on if the data location exists on filesystem. Another one is `HiveTablePartitionTimeBasedRetentionPolicy`, which is based on some timestamp. Now the default behavior is based on modified timestamp.

mentioned in the mailing list, the existing gobblin configuration means that if any topic configured to have a larger buffer size than the default of 1mb will silently fail to be consumed when a large message is read. The silence is mostly Kafka's fault, but Gobblin should be able to be to support topics with large messages through a configuration parameter.\n\nI am sending this as a preliminary patch, expecting you guys might have problems with it, because to be fair, the situation is a bit tricky: The KafkaOldAPI is the piece that needs this configuration, but it receives no configuration information.\n\nGiven that this is theoretically different by topic (although for some reason, KafkaTopicMetaData won't produce this information), I thought it really should be handled as something done by topic, although, for the time being, I am feeding the data from the work unit.\n\nFor the call that we make to get the list of kafka topics, I am using the defaults instead, because it doesn't seem like a place where one would change message topics, and trickling that up to a point that can read the configuration seems like quite a few changes.\n\nI'd be happy to take a different approach, but then I'd like guidance on what would make the PR
