Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the password managers autofill functionality in the 2FA OTP code form.\r\nIt is caused by double `<form>` element. \r\n\r\n\r\nFixes: #9510\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\nThe PR simply removes the outer empty `<form>` element, leaving the inner one intact.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Install 1password password manager and the browser extension.\r\n2. Enable 2FA authentication for your Cloudstack user.\r\n3. Save the OTP token for your user in 1password so it now provides OTP passwords.\r\n4. Try to login to Cloudstack UI with 1password autofill. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n1password fills all 6 numbers of the OTP token into the input form.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n1password only fills 3 numbers out of 6 into the input form.\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the triggering policy for log4j from time based to size based. This helps prevents issues where disk gets full due to logs on the disk and the application becomes unavailable.\r\n\r\nI have set the max file size to 100 MB and the maximum number of old logs files to be retained to 10. At max the storage required for a single log file will be 100MB * (10 old log files + 1 current log file) = 1100MB. The actual size would be less since the old log files are gzipped.\r\n\r\nAdded these 2 variables which are configured in replace.properties:\r\n\r\n`LOGMAXINDEX` - Maximum number of old files to retain.\r\n`LOGMAXFILESIZE` - Maximum size of the log file before rotation\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

Description\r\n\r\nFollowing changes and improvements have been added:\r\n\r\n- Improvements in handling of PingRoutingCommand\r\n\r\n    1. Added global config - `vm.sync.power.state.transitioning`, default value: true, to control syncing of power states for transitioning VMs. This can be set to false to prevent computation of transitioning state VMs.\r\n    2. Improved VirtualMachinePowerStateSync to allow power state sync for host VMs in a batch\r\n    3. Optimized scanning stalled VMs\r\n\r\n- Added option to set worker threads for capacity calculation using config - `capacity.calculate.workers`\r\n\r\n- Added caching for account/use role API access with expiration after write can be configured using config - `dynamic.apichecker.cache.period`. If set to zero then there will be no caching. Default is 0.\r\n\r\n- Added caching for account/use role API access with expiration after write set to 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n- Added caching for some recurring DB retrievals\r\n\r\n    1. CapacityManager - listing service offerings - beneficial in host capacity calculation\r\n    2. LibvirtServerDiscoverer existing host for the cluster - beneficial for host joins\r\n    3. DownloadListener - hypervisors for zone - beneficial for host joins\r\n    5. VirtualMachineManagerImpl - VMs in progress- beneficial for processing stalled VMs during PingRoutingCommands\r\n\r\n- Optimized MS list retrieval for agent connect\r\n\r\n- Optimize finding ready systemvm template for zone\r\n\r\n- Database retrieval optimisations - fix and refactor for cases where only IDs or counts are used mainly for hosts and other infra entities. Also similar cases for VMs and other entities related to host concerning background tasks\r\n\r\n- Changes in agent-agentmanager connection with NIO client-server classes\r\n\r\n    1. Optimized the use of the executor service\r\n    2. Refactore Agent class to better handle connections.\r\n    3. Do SSL handshakes within worker threads\r\n    5. Added global configs to control the behaviour depending on the infra. SSL handshake and initial processing of a new agent could be a bottleneck during agent connections. Configs - `agent.max.concurrent.new.connections` can be used to control number of new connections management server handles at a time. `agent.ssl.handshake.timeout` can be used to set number of seconds after which SSL handshake times out at MS end.\r\n    6. On agent side backoff and sslhandshake timeout can be controlled by agent properties. `backoff.seconds` and `ssl.handshake.timeout` properties can be used.\r\n\r\n- Improvements in StatsCollection - minimize DB retrievals.\r\n\r\n- Improvements in DeploymentPlanner allow for the retrieval of only desired host fields and fewer retrievals.\r\n\r\n- Improvements in hosts connection for a storage pool. Added config - `storage.pool.host.connect.workers` to control the number of worker threads that can be used to connect hosts to a storage pool. Worker thread approach is followed currently only for NFS and ScaleIO pools.\r\n\r\n- Minor improvements in resource limit calculations wrt DB retrievals\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit e06f80e899127abe45c10ff2d38420a770ceb076.\r\n\r\nI have discussed with @NuxRo @rajujith @alexandremattioli  , it seems  it is expected that private template has only 1 copy on the secondary storages.\r\n\r\nwe all agreed that it should be improved as the template with 1 copy becomes unavailable if the secondary storage is removed. \r\nideally there is a global setting to specify the minimum number of  copies on secondary storages.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, creating templates for `DATADISK` volumes is only possible if they have already been part of a VM and are detached. This behavior has been extended so that the volume does not need to be detached and the template can be created as long as the VM is stopped.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the UI allows templates to be created for `ROOT` volumes in the `Allocated` state, however, the creation always results in an error as the volume needs to exist in the primary storage for the template creation to be possible. With the changes, this option is no longer available.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code

appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn the UI, I tried creating a template from a volume in different scenarios:\r\n\r\n| N° | VM State | Volume Type | Volume State | Could

Description\r\nIn UI for the list views it is regular API view by default and *Metrics API response may not be needed. *Metrics APIs will take more time to return response so this PR tries to improve the behaviour and enables calling regular API without metrics when metrics toggle is not enabled.\r\n\r\nFollowing fields in the corresponding listview have been moved to metrics fields as they're not available in non-metrics response,\r\n\r\n- zones: `clusters`\r\n- clusters: `state, hosts`\r\n- hosts: `instances, powerstates` \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #7490\r\n\r\nAccording to libvirt code, the units per scsi controller is set to 7\r\ntherefore, we need to create scsi controller every 7 disks (including CDROM).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/libvirt/libvirt/blob/50cc7a0d9d2b9df085ec073a6d60820a9642158a/src/conf/domain_conf.h#L3007-L3008\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/libvirt/libvirt/blob/50cc7a0d9d2b9df085ec073a6d60820a9642158a/src/conf/domain_conf.c#L6701-L6704\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue\r\n- register a template or update template guest os type to \"Other PV (VirtIO SCSI)\"\r\n- create vm\r\n- attach 6 disks. check vm xml dump, it looks good\r\n```\r\n    <disk

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR now allows us to check all our Python files with flake8.\r\n\r\nThe excluded files have been cleaned up and formatted with black.\r\n\r\n\"By using Black, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.\r\n\r\nBlack makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible. Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you’re reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\"\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows importing of a VM on VMWare via another host. This is useful in cases when import in the current cluster is not possible due to different versions of virt-v2v.\r\n\r\nDocs PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/453\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\nImport from VMWare to KVM consists of these steps\r\n\r\n1. ovf import (done by MS if ovftool is missing)\r\n2. virt-v2v conversion and exporting kvm image to secondary storage or primary storage\r\n3. import kvm image on the host\r\n\r\nEarlier, step 2 & 3 were executed together on the destination host using a single Command from MS to Agent.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, we split the Command into 2 separate Commands.\r\n\r\n- Command 1 is only for conversion using virt-v2v.\r\n- Command 2 is only for importing the images in the destination cluster.\r\n\r\nNow, you can select the host you want to use for the conversion which can be in a different kvm cluster from the destination cluster for the import.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For

Description\r\n\r\nNetwork tiers which belong to a VPC have their own individual names, in the networks tab they are listed with all other networks, in order to make it easier to identify those networks and correlate them with the VPCs. their names should be prepended with the name of the VPC they belong to.\r\n\r\nThis PR prepends VPC name to the network tier name using a delimiter.\r\nThis

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR does multiple UI improvements\r\n\r\n1. Autofill vCenter host, datacenter and credentials while adding cluster using the zone wide value from vmware_data_center table \r\n2. Show Usage settings as a different pane in global settings\r\n3. Option to attach the volume to an instance during volume create.\r\n4. Show mgmt server's service ip in the details tab of Infrastructure -> Management server.\r\n5. Don't display create volume snapshot button in the Instance tab for KVM, if the instance is running and \"kvm.snapshot.enabled\" is false. (Also contains some code cleanup in storage.js)\r\n6. The name Recurring snapshots is used everywhere except for one place where 'Scheduled' snapshots is used in the Recurring Snapshots form. Change it to Recurring Snapshots.\r\n7. Reorder the Hypervisor list shown everywhere in order of popularity. \r\n\r\nItems 1,3,4,5,6 are UI only changes, and can be tested with just the UI.\r\n\r\nDoc PR :

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR ads two additional methods to detect cpu speed on kvm hosts.

For other cpu's the detected cpu speed ca change to the max Mhz of the cpu. \r\n\r\n1. A match on the `CPU max MHz` value from lscpu\r\n2.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when resize a volume, ACS checks if the current storage pool can accommodate the new size, and simply return true if pool has enough capacity, or false if there are not enough capacity.\r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n- add global and zone setting volume.resize.allowed.beyond.allocation and pool.storage.allocated.resize.capacity.disablethreshold\r\n- add API parameter automigrate to resizeVolume API.\r\n\r\nwhen resize a volume\r\n- check if the pool capacity (with new volume size) is above disable threshold `pool.storage.allocated.capacity.disablethreshold`\r\n- if  pool capacity is below disable threshold, operation succeeds.\r\n- if  pool capacity is above disable threshold\r\n  * if `volume.resize.allowed.beyond.allocation` is `false`, go to migration step\r\n  * if `volume.resize.allowed.beyond.allocation` is `true`, it will check pool capacity for resize threshold `pool.storage.allocated.resize.capacity.disablethreshold`. \r\n    * if yes, operation succeeds.\r\n    * if not, go to migration step\r\n- migrate volume to another pool\r\n  * find storage pools by tags, storage types, pool allocation capacity (consider current volume size), and etc\r\n  * filter storage pool by resize capacity threshold (consider new volume size)\r\n  * if no pool found, operation fails.\r\n  * if automigrate is false, operation fails\r\n  * if automigrate is true, try to migrate volume to another pool\r\n    - if migration succeeds (for example vm is stopped), operation succeeds\r\n    - if migration fails (for example vm is running on KVM), operation

Description\r\n \r\nIn ACS Once a volume is migrated, it duplicates its row in the database and labels the previous one as removed; however, there is no reference to the deleted row, making it so the operator is unable to track the previous volume effectively. This PR aims to change this by adding a new column to the table volumes called `last_id`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing

Description\r\n\r\nApache CloudStack already supports a wide range of hypervisors, including KVM, VMware, and Xen, to provision and manage instances. We are now introducing a new feature or framework that allows seamless integration of \"external\" provisioning systems into CloudStack. For example, this enables the integration of any baremetal provisioning system, platforms like Proxmox, or even the addition of new hypervisor support through the use of simple scripts.\r\n\r\nA

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR Adds A New Object Storage Provider Plugin for Cloudian HyperStore\r\n\r\n- Allow the CloudStack administrator to connect to Cloudian HyperStore object storage.\r\n- Once connected, CloudStack Accounts can create buckets that are managed by and belong to their own Account.\r\n- IAM Credentials are available for each bucket such that Accounts can use the buckets either from 3rd party S3 applications or from the CloudStack Bucket Browser UI Feature.\r\n- The plugin supports all the current CloudStack bucket operations such as Object Lock, Versioning, Encryption and policy settings.\r\n- The plugin currently does not support setting a bucket quota as HyperStore does not currently support that functionality.\r\n- Bucket usage is supported.\r\n\r\nMore Details:\r\n\r\n- See plugins/storage/object/cloudian/README.md for details\r\n\r\nUI Changes - Add Object Storage for Cloudian HyperStore:\r\n\r\n- Cloudian HyperStore Object Storage requires more fields than Minio, Ceph and Simulator so when the Cloudian HyperStore provider is selected, the GUI adjusts and offers the extra fields that the provider requires.\r\n\r\nOther Bug fixes and improvements as part of this fix I kept in separate commits.\r\n\r\n- Use a password input field type for object store secret key entry\r\n- Fix to avoid pre-pending a second '/' to the object name in the Bucket Browser Feature.\r\n- Fix issue where usage may not be collected if another object store is down.\r\n- Various fixes and enhancements to CloudianClient\r\n\r\n<!---

src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/755d38e2-5c7c-4c06-a6ed-07d95aa08986\">\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. Unit Testing\r\n2. Testing against the Cloudian HyperStore system. Tested bad configurations and credentials, system down.\r\n3. Monitored log entries and sniffed network connections.\r\n4. Tested the various UI compontents such as Add Object Storage, Edit and Delete Object Storage. Adding buckets with various Accounts and Projects, editing bucket configurations, verifying configurations were set using different S3 exploration tools.\r\n5. Tested the bucket browser UI component against HyperStore.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n- As this change altered CloudianClient which is

addresses that issue that plugins customisation in the UI (https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.19.1.1/adminguide/ui.html#basic-ui-c\r\nustomization) isn't able to use all the ant-design-vue icons.\r\n\r\nWe already use and support fontawesome components such as for Kubernetes menu etc.\r\nThis extends the usage of fontawesome (free) solid icons for custom plugins\r\nsection in config.json. The plugin can be defined as array:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"plugins\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"HomeLab\",\r\n        \"icon\": [\"fa-solid\", \"fa-server\"],\r\n        \"path\": \"https://dash.yadav.cloud/dash/\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the icons is declared as a json array config, where the first\r\nparameter is the pack/type name (\"fa-solid\") and the second parameter is\r\nthe icons name with the \"fa-\" prefix.\r\n\r\nThe solid icon can be searched and used from here:\r\nhttps://fontawesome.com/search?q=server&o=r&s=solid\r\n\r\nThis also fixes icon size inconsistency when fa os-logo icons are used versus when resource icons are used. This also changes some of the infocard icons to use better icons from font awesome.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nWith the example json snipped defined above, would result in this which uses a font awesome solid icon:\r\n<img width=\"330\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-28 at 12 38 03 PM\"

Local value should always take precedence unless it is set to Inherit.\r\nTested the following matrix. Result denotes if Api key access was allowed for the User or not.\r\n\r\n| User | Account | Domain | Global | Result |\r\n|------|---------|---------|--------|-------|\r\n| Inherit | Inherit | Inherit | **Enabled** | Enabled |\r\n| Inherit | Inherit | Inherit | **Disabled** | Disabled |\r\n| Inherit | Inherit | **Enabled** | Disabled | Enabled |\r\n| Inherit | **Disabled** | Enabled | Enabled | Disabled |\r\n| **Disabled** | Enabled | Enabled | Enabled | Disabled |\r\n| **Enabled** | Inherit | Inherit | Disabled | Enabled |\r\n\r\n2. Tested that apikeyaccess parameter in updateUser, updateAccount, listUsers and listAccounts is not shown to anyone else apart from the Root Admin.\r\n\r\n3. Tested that api.key.access configuration is not editable by the domain admin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for functionality in hypervisor class. This solves 2 issues:\r\n1. Allow configuring supported functionality of a hypervisor in Hypervisor class itself and remove custom logic of different hypervisors in the code. For now, we are only functionalities. Rest can be added later.\r\n2. This allows custom hypervisor plugins to define their supported functionalities as well.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

Description\r\n\r\nThe MS sends the destroy/delete command of a VM to vCenter when cleaning up its volumes.  If the VM does not have a root volume, the VM with its folder and metadata files remain in vCenter.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, deploy a VM, detach its volume, and delete the VM. Then, check vCenter and the VM will still be there.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by implementing finalizeExpunge for VMWareGuru, which queues a Cleanup Command that, if the VM still exists, sends a destroy command to vCenter to cleanup whatever remained.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description\r\n \r\nThis PR restricts users from migrating volumes attached to VMs that are in starting state. Migrating volumes while their VMs are starting shouldn't be allowed because sometimes the VM could end up not actually starting, and if ACS starts migrating its volume, this could lead to other issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n<details><summary>Image</summary>\r\n\r\n![migrate-volume](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eac1c4b3-e8d4-4e91-a7dd-636fc4533e88)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested this PR by deploying an instance and then trying to migrate its volume while the instance was starting. Before the changes, the volume migration process would start.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the \"ownership selection\" UI fields to VPC tiers and VPC public IPs. \r\n\r\nThe \"vpcAccess\" response attribute was added so the UI can know if the caller has access to the VPC without needing to make a whole new request. This is needed to avoid 404 links (since router.resolve is assembled through API permissions) and so the UI can present the correct public IPs to their possible network tiers (e.g. if the User has tiers of two different VPCs, they can't use one's public IP in the other).\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>New tier possible owners' listing </summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aab77e1-2105-423b-b976-f937c5cd732e)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Tier listing</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d952e39d-76e1-403d-b143-762488896a73)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>User accessing their tier of the Admin's VPC</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d952e39d-76e1-403d-b143-762488896a73)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Possible owners for new IP</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daae5363-358e-4ff9-a3a0-02e23f69cce3)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nEnvironment with domains Root (with accounts Root Admin and User), Root/1 (with a Domain Admin), Root/A (with a Domain Admin) and Root/A/B (with a Domain Admin and a User). There is a Project in each domain, owned by the respective admins.\r\n\r\n| Situation  | Test |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| As Root Admin with VPC owned by self. | Every account and project listed as possible owners in Tier creation |\r\n| As Root Admin with VPC owned by self and one tier for each account and project. | Every account and project listed as possible owners in acquiring public IP. |\r\n| Same as previous, but remove some of the tiers. | The deleted tiers' owners also disappeared from IP possible owners' list, except Root Admin itself. |\r\n| As Root Admin

Description\r\n\r\nWhen manipulating VM and template settings, the UI provides a dropdown with the available setting names and values. However, if a user first adds a setting and then tries to add another, the dropdown only shows the previously added setting's name and value.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, whenever the user types a character into the setting name input field, a Vue warning is thrown in the console, stating that an incorrect value type has been passed to the `options` prop of the `a-auto-complete` component.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR improves VM and template settings filtering by always displaying the available setting names and their values, even when a setting has already been added. Besides that, the Vue warning has been properly fixed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #8074\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [X] Trivial\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f8b851a-919e-4f98-b135-7760d68a2185)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/415ad6d9-1cf6-4af5-a194-c1116eed967f)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. When adding the first setting of a VM/template, I verified that all available setting names and their values were displayed correctly in the dropdowns.\r\n2. I then added another setting, and all available setting names and their values were also displayed correctly.\r\n3.

Description\r\nCurrently, the expansion of the textarea field in the _quota tariff_ creation and update forms is limited to vertical growth. This can make the experience unsatisfactory for entering larger texts, as the field does not expand horizontally, which can hinder the visualization and editing of the content.\r\n\r\nChanges have been made to the UI to allow the textarea to expand in both directions (vertical and horizontal).\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing

Description\r\n\r\nThe new CheckOnHostCommand constructor was missing a reasonable timeout value, which meant it would fallback to the wait (1800s) timeout. On a Linstor cluster this resulted in over 15 minutes wait time until a host was recognized as down.\r\nWith timeout of 20s (as the other constructor) it takes 4-5 mins for a host to become recognized as down.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows Backup and Recovery operations on Shared FileSystem Instances.\r\n- It was disallowed earlier to reduce interactions\r\n- Prospect users suggested that it is a very useful feature to have and will negatively impact feature adoption\r\n- Backup and Recovery works out of the box with Shared FIleSystems Instances as with any other instance. No special changes are required to support it. I only had to remove certain checks.\r\n- This change has no interaction with any other subsystem of cloudstack.\r\n- Tested all workflows with NAS BnR plugin.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in

Description\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\nAdded configuration key `powerflex.connect.on.demand`. When set to `false`, then logic in ScaleIO plugin to disconnect Host from the storage pool when there are no volumes and connect Host to storage pool when new volume created will not be used (https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/9268).\r\n\r\nThe reason for that - plugin's connect/disconnect logic stops and starts `scini` service. If Host connected to multiple storage pools, then it won't be disconnected from unused pools, there will be all or none. Also we observed `scini` stability issue - after multiple start/stop it is not always starting back properly.\r\nFor now we would like to have flag to enable/disable this feature.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as part of the PR, added SQL to update `resource_reservation` table with two new columns. Right now we are copy-pasting that SQL within RPMs to be executed during deployment, but having migration script would be better issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed

Description\r\n\r\nCloudStack has a global setting \"wait\" which controls the wait time by the management server for all the commands which it sends. There are also some command specific timeout settings which controls specific commands like \"ready.command.wait\", \"kvm.storage.online.migration.wait\", etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies these configurations by introducing a new parent global setting which serves as a single point to configure any command timeout. The new global setting is \"commands. timeout\", this timeout overrides the wait global config. This holds a comma separated key value pairs containing timeout for specific commands. For example: DhcpEntryCommand=600, SavePasswordCommand=300, VmDataCommand=300. \r\n\r\nThere are also some hardcoded values defined in the code base for few commands. so the order of precedence of all these timeouts will be \r\n\r\n\"commands.timeout\" > Existing global settings > Hardcoded value for the command > global \"wait\"\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-09T12:58:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T11:36:52Z","closed_at":"2025-01-07T11:36:33Z","merged_at":"2025-01-07T11:36:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"9bc283e5c265f4c7714249a7cee046aadfe065c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592389048,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIzODkwNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:ready-for-merge","name":"status:ready-for-merge","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nThe Single Sign On (SSO) URL that the CloudStack Cloudian Integration plugin generates includes a `redirect` portion. This used to be required on the older 6.x Cloudian Management Console (CMC) in order for the admin user to see an appropriate page on login. As of 7.x+, it is better to `redirect` both types of users to `/` and let CMC display the appropriate page.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately as this is an integration it may be difficult to confirm this fix without running Cloudian HyperStore on your network and configuring the Cloudian plugin as per CloudStack documentation.

To test this fix, I configured CloudStack to enable the Cloudian plugin and pointed it at a Cloudian HyperStore system that I have on my network. I tried the plugin without the fix first to confirm existing broken behaviour and then I applied the fix, recompiled and retested to confirm the changes worked as expected. I took screenshots (above) showing each of the cases.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2024-09-09T07:19:07Z","updated_at":"2024-09-10T20:38:34Z","closed_at":"2024-09-10T12:52:59Z","merged_at":"2024-09-10T12:52:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"638c1526d0a71fc422ffa9ed694afde3d51e1bc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5650616953,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M8AAAABUM2SeQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/has-3rdparty-components","name":"has-3rdparty-components","color":"8AD653","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30/labels","id":9577330,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AkiNy","number":30,"title":"4.20.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":245,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-06-23T18:43:29Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T09:42:31Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-11-27T14:52:35Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/aff716a6ee24f006cb804f52327f47366b0d3fce","head":{"label":"tpodowd:fix_cloudian_integration_redirect_link","ref":"fix_cloudian_integration_redirect_link","sha":"aff716a6ee24f006cb804f52327f47366b0d3fce","user":{"login":"tpodowd","id":235524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd","html_url":"https://github.com/tpodowd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":853241737,"node_id":"R_kgDOMttviQ","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"tpodowd/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tpodowd","id":235524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd","html_url":"https://github.com/tpodowd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpodowd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tpodowd/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nWhen attaching a volume to an instance, CloudStack calculates the next free unit number of the disk controller that should be associated with the volume. However, for IDE disk controllers, CD/DVD drives associated with the controller are not taken into consideration when calculating the next available unit number. Due to this, an error happens in some situations when trying to attach a volume to an instance over IDE controllers because CloudStack tries to associate the volume to an unit number that is already being used.\r\n\r\nThe generic method of reproducing this problem is:\r\n1. Deploy a VM\r\n2. Set `dataDiskController` to `ide`\r\n3. If there are any volumes using IDE controllers, detach them\r\n4. Try to attach a volume\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by making the code also consider CD/DVD drives. Tests will be added in another PR alongside an extension for the disk controllers that I'm currently working on, as it will require me to modify this code again.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I deployed a VM from a template with both `rootDiskController` and `dataDiskController` set to `ide`, with only a root disk\r\n2. I detached the root disk\r\n3. I reattached the root disk. Before, an exception would be thrown in this step. After the changes, I verified that the volume was associated successfully to IDE(0:1)\r\n5. I attached a data disk. I verified that the volume was associated successfully to IDE(1:0)\r\n6. I attached another data disk. I verified that the volume was associated successfully to IDE(1:1)\r\n7.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen both `rootDiskController` and `dataDiskController` details are set to SCSI controllers, the VM creation and start processes prioritize creating and using the controllers specified by `rootDiskController` for all volumes. However, the volume attachment process does not consider this and always tries to attach volumes using the controllers specified for the data disks (even if a root disk is being attached). \r\n\r\nThis way, in a scenario where `rootDiskController` is set to `pvscsi` and `dataDiskController` is set to `lsilogic` (one example, as this problem also happens for other combinations) we ignore the `dataDiskController` setting defined by the operator and choose to use only PVSCSI controllers for both the root and data disks on VM creation/start. Then, when a user tries to attach a new data disk, we only consider `dataDiskController` and try to attach with LSI Logic instead. However, the process fails, as there are no LSI Logic controllers because we ignored the data disk controller chosen by the operator and opted to create PVSCSI controllers for both root and data disks when creating/starting the VM. Also, if we detach the root disk and try to attach it again, the process also fails because CloudStack tries to attach it using the controller specified for the data disks.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, this PR makes the volume attachment disk controller selection logic consistent with VM creation/start. Tests will be added in another PR alongside an extension for the disk controllers that I'm currently working on, as it will require me to modify this code again.\r\n\r\nFixes #9400\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nFor each of the following `rootDiskController`/`dataDiskController` combinations: \r\n1.

PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/433\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows adding deletion protection for a VM & volume. If the flag is enabled for a VM or a volume, the deletion of that resource fails. This feature helps user prevent deletion of critical resources by mistake.\r\n\r\nIf the resource is part of an Autoscaling group, CKS or any other plugin/feature, deletion protection flag is ignored. i.e. Deletion protection works only while deletion of resource via `destroyVirtualMachine` & `deleteVolume` command.\r\n\r\nAs of now, delete protection can be enabled only after the resource has been created/deployed. i.e. only updateVirtualMachine & updateVolume commands can set the deleteprotection for a resource.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-04T09:17:34Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T12:45:37Z","closed_at":"2024-09-09T12:44:51Z","merged_at":"2024-09-09T12:44:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"1303a4f323dc21f23cff60a3ed83694f7d76d89c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...
