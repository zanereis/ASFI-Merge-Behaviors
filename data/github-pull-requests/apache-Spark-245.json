What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `fit` method in `StringIndexer` sorts given labels in a sequential approach, if there are multiple input columns. When the number of input column increases, the time of label sorting dramatically increases too so it is hard to use in practice if dealing with hundreds of input columns.\r\n\r\nThis patch tries to make the label sorting parallel.\r\n\r\nThis runs benchmark like:\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StringIndexer\r\n\r\nval numCol = 300\r\n\r\nval data = (0 to 100).map { i =>\r\n  (i, 100 * i)\r\n}\r\nvar df = data.toDF(\"id\", \"label0\")\r\n(1 to numCol).foreach { idx =>\r\n  df = df.withColumn(s\"label$idx\", col(\"label0\") + 1)\r\n}\r\nval inputCols = (0 to numCol).map(i => s\"label$i\").toArray\r\nval outputCols = (0 to numCol).map(i => s\"labelIndex$i\").toArray\r\nval t0 = System.nanoTime()\r\nval indexer = new StringIndexer().setInputCols(inputCols).setOutputCols(outputCols).setStringOrderType(\"alphabetDesc\").fit(df)\r\nval t1 = System.nanoTime()\r\nprintln(\"Elapsed time: \" + (t1 - t0) / 1000000000.0 + \"s\")      \r\n```\r\n\r\n| numCol  | 20 | 50  | 100  | 200  | 300 |\r\n|--:|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n|  Before |  9.85 |  28.62 | 64.35  | 167.17  | 431.60 |\r\n| After  | 2.44  | 2.71  | 3.34  | 4.83  | 6.90 |\r\n\r\nUnit: second\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPassed existing tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn my application spark streaming is restarted programmatically by stopping StreamingContext without stopping of SparkContext and creating/starting a new one. I use it for automatic detection of Kafka topic/partition changes and automatic failover in case of non fatal exceptions.\r\n\r\nHowever i notice that after multiple restarts driver fails with OOM. During investigation of heap dump i figured out that StreamingContext object isn't cleared by GC after stopping.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1901\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-08-14 at 12 23 33\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13151161/63010149-83f4c200-be8e-11e9-9f48-12b6e97839f4.png\">\r\n\r\nThere are several places which holds reference to it :\r\n\r\n1. StreamingTab registers StreamingJobProgressListener which holds reference to Streaming Context directly to LiveListenerBus shared queue via ssc.sc.addSparkListener(listener) method invocation. However this listener isn't unregistered at stop method.\r\n2. json handlers (/streaming/json and /streaming/batch/json) aren't unregistered in SparkUI, while they hold reference to StreamingJobProgressListener. Basically the same issue affects all the pages, i assume that renderJsonHandler should be added to pageToHandlers cache on attachPage method invocation in order to unregistered it as well on detachPage.\r\n3. SparkUi holds reference to StreamingJobProgressListener in the corresponding local variable which isn't cleared after stopping of StreamingContext.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanged type of `sec` argument in the `make_timestamp()` function from `DOUBLE` to `DECIMAL(8, 6)`. The scale is set to 6 to cover microsecond fractions, and the precision is 2 digits for seconds + 6 digits for microsecond fraction. New type prevents losing precision in some cases, for example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select make_timestamp(2019, 8, 12, 0, 0, 58.000001);\r\n2019-08-12 00:00:58\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select make_timestamp(2019, 8, 12, 0, 0, 58.000001);\r\n2019-08-12 00:00:58.000001\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso switching to `DECIMAL` fixes rounding `sec` towards \"nearest neighbor\" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round up. For example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select make_timestamp(2019, 8, 12, 0, 0, 0.1234567);\r\n2019-08-12 00:00:00.123456\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select make_timestamp(2019, 8, 12, 0, 0, 0.1234567);\r\n2019-08-12 00:00:00.123457\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested by `DateExpressionsSuite` and `pgSQL/timestamp.sql`.","created_at":"2019-08-12T15:03:09Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T19:17:17Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T22:56:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a83752d1d6045cbc88029e33a46398b6366265c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7781ddb1f8cc8d6d849b5d535714df72906e07b5","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:make_timestamp-decimal","ref":"make_timestamp-decimal","sha":"7781ddb1f8cc8d6d849b5d535714df72906e07b5","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe mapping of Spark schema to Avro schema is many-to-many. (See https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-avro.html#supported-types-for-spark-sql---avro-conversion)\r\nThe default schema mapping might not be exactly what users want. For example, by default, a \"string\" column is always written as \"string\" Avro type, but users might want to output the column as \"enum\" Avro type.\r\nWith PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-28163](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28163) fixed a bug and during the analysis we've concluded it would be more robust to use `CaseInsensitiveMap` inside Kafka source. This case less lower/upper case problem would rise in the future.\r\n\r\nPlease note this PR doesn't intend to solve any kind of actual problem but finish the concept added in [SPARK-28163](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28163) (in a fix PR I didn't want to add too invasive changes). In this PR I've changed `Map[String, String]` to `CaseInsensitiveMap[String]` to enforce the usage. These are the main use-cases:\r\n* `contains` => `CaseInsensitiveMap` solves it\r\n* `get...` => `CaseInsensitiveMap` solves it\r\n* `filter` => keys must be converted to lowercase because there is no guarantee that the incoming map has such key set\r\n* `find` => keys must be converted to lowercase because there is no guarantee that the incoming map has such key set\r\n* passing parameters to Kafka consumer/producer => keys must be converted to lowercase because there is no guarantee that the incoming map has such key set\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent two PySpark version tests in PythonTestsSuite, just test against Python version at driver side. Because the test script doesn't run any spark job requiring python worker, it doesn't actually do version check at worker side. This patch adds pieces of code to the test script, to run a simple job to verify Python version.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose new function `date_part()`. The function is modeled on the traditional Ingres equivalent to the SQL-standard function `extract`:\r\n```\r\ndate_part('field', source)\r\n```\r\nand added for feature parity with PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT).\r\n\r\nThe `source` can have `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` type. Supported string values of `'field'` are:\r\n- `millennium` - the current millennium for given date (or a timestamp implicitly casted to a date). For example, years in the 1900s are in the second millennium. The third millennium started _January 1, 2001_.\r\n- `century` - the current millennium for given date (or timestamp). The first century starts at 0001-01-01 AD.\r\n- `decade` - the current decade for given date (or timestamp). Actually, this is the year field divided by 10.\r\n- isoyear` - the ISO 8601 week-numbering year that the date falls in. Each ISO 8601 week-numbering year begins with the Monday of the week containing the 4th of January.\r\n- `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`\r\n- `week` - the number of the ISO 8601 week-numbering week of the year. By definition, ISO weeks start on Mondays and the first week of a year contains January 4 of that year.\r\n- `quarter` - the quarter of the year (1 - 4)\r\n- `dayofweek` - the day of the week for date/timestamp (1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 7 = Saturday)\r\n- `dow` - the day of the week as Sunday (0) to Saturday (6)\r\n- `isodow` - the day of the week as Monday (1) to Sunday (7)\r\n- `doy` - the day of the year (1 - 365/366)\r\n- `milliseconds` - the seconds field including fractional parts multiplied by 1,000.\r\n- `microseconds` - the seconds field including fractional parts multiplied by 1,000,000.\r\n- `epoch` - the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 local time in microsecond precision.\r\n\r\nHere are examples:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_part('year', timestamp'2019-08-12 01:00:00.123456');\r\n2019\r\nspark-sql> select date_part('week', timestamp'2019-08-12 01:00:00.123456');\r\n33\r\nspark-sql> select date_part('doy', timestamp'2019-08-12 01:00:00.123456');\r\n224\r\n```\r\n\r\nI changed implementation of `extract` to re-use `date_part()` internally.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded `date_part.sql` and regenerated results of `extract.sql`.","created_at":"2019-08-11T19:08:51Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T19:17:25Z","closed_at":"2019-09-06T14:36:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2296a6d94ef86684f7a51335cadda84b60eec19f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25410/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25410/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25410/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/600eee6d8ceef00f6554b64d03aaff404917c975","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:date_part","ref":"date_part","sha":"600eee6d8ceef00f6554b64d03aaff404917c975","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

 What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies the explanation of guarantee for ForeachWriter as it doesn't guarantee same output for `(partitionId, epochId)`. Refer the description of [SPARK-28650](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28650) for more details.\r\n\r\nSpark itself still guarantees same output for same epochId (batch) if the preconditions are met, 1) source is always providing the same input records for same offset request. 2) the query is idempotent in overall (indeterministic calculation like now(), random() can break this). \r\n\r\nAssuming breaking preconditions as an exceptional case (the preconditions are implicitly required even before), we still can describe the guarantee with `epochId`, though it will be  harder to leverage the guarantee: 1) ForeachWriter should implement a feature to track whether all the partitions are written successfully for given `epochId` 2) There's pretty less chance to leverage the fact, as the chance for Spark to successfully write all partitions and fail to checkpoint the batch is small.\r\n\r\nCredit to @zsxwing on discovering the broken guarantee.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is just a documentation change, both on javadoc and guide doc.","created_at":"2019-08-11T13:35:10Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T16:14:43Z","closed_at":"2019-08-20T07:57:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15a032bee61bb8a89d3c956b70cd169f35e7b5de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe add support for the V2SessionCatalog for saveAsTable, such that V2 tables can plug in and leverage existing DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable APIs to write and create tables through the session catalog.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests. A lot of tests broke under hive when things were not working properly under `ResolveTables`, therefore I believe the current set of tests should be sufficient in testing the table resolution and read code paths.","created_at":"2019-08-09T20:35:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-24T04:54:40Z","closed_at":"2019-08-15T04:34:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b317303f03db4210facf9ed06c58da1388d49cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a70e72676da6442a45e3a358c734b6f161c615d0","head":{"label":"brkyvz:saveAsV2","ref":"saveAsV2","sha":"a70e72676da6442a45e3a358c734b6f161c615d0","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn high workload environments, ContextCleaner seems to have excessive logging at INFO level which do not give much information. In one Particular case we see that ``INFO ContextCleaner: Cleaned accumulator`` message is 25-30% of the generated logs. We can log this information for cleanup in DEBUG level instead.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis do not modify any functionality.

The first century starts at 0001-01-01 AD.\r\n3. `decade` - the current decade for given date (or timestamp).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPlans after \"Extract Python UDFs\" are very flaky and error-prone to other rules.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if we add some rules, for instance, `PushDownPredicates` in `postHocOptimizationBatches`, the test in `BatchEvalPythonExecSuite` fails:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntest(\"Python UDF refers to the attributes from more than one child\") {\r\n  val df = Seq((\"Hello\", 4)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n  val df2 = Seq((\"Hello\", 4)).toDF(\"c\", \"d\")\r\n  val joinDF = df.crossJoin(df2).where(\"dummyPythonUDF(a, c) == dummyPythonUDF(d, c)\")\r\n  val qualifiedPlanNodes = joinDF.queryExecution.executedPlan.collect {\r\n    case b: BatchEvalPythonExec => b\r\n  }\r\n  assert(qualifiedPlanNodes.size == 1)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalid PythonUDF dummyUDF(a#63, c#74), requires attributes from more than one child.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because Python UDF extraction optimization is rolled back as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PushDownPredicates ===\r\n!Filter (dummyUDF(a#7, c#18) = dummyUDF(d#19, c#18))   Join Cross, (dummyUDF(a#7, c#18) = dummyUDF(d#19, c#18))\r\n!+- Join Cross                                         :- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]\r\n!   :- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]              :  +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n!   :  +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]                   +- Project [_1#13 AS c#18, _2#14 AS d#19]\r\n!   +- Project [_1#13 AS c#18, _2#14 AS d#19]             +- LocalRelation [_1#13, _2#14]\r\n!      +- LocalRelation [_1#13, _2#14]                 \r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems we should do Python UDFs cases at the last even after post hoc rules.\r\n\r\nNote that this actually rather follows the way in previous versions when those were in physical plans (see SPARK-24721 and SPARK-12981). Those optimization rules were supposed to be placed at the end.\r\n\r\nNote that I intentionally didn't move `ExperimentalMethods` (`spark.experimental.extraStrategies`). This is an explicit experimental API and I wanted to just-in-case workaround after this change for now.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover.","created_at":"2019-08-08T07:46:39Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:30Z","closed_at":"2019-08-08T12:25:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56bbd60c6d4d1c3c8db55d1ebb233e0b7e54b07e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba8dcb7204f332c2c7c79efdda6618c2d14e7b72","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-28654","ref":"SPARK-28654","sha":"ba8dcb7204f332c2c7c79efdda6618c2d14e7b72","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf you build Spark distributions you potentially end up with a `python/.eggs` directory in your working copy which is not currently ignored by Spark's `.gitignore` file.  Since these are transient build artifacts there is no reason to ever commit these to Git so this should be placed in the `.gitignore` list\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nVerified the offending artifacts were no longer reported as untracked content by

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBy SPARK-17019, `On Heap Memory` and `Off Heap Memory` are introduced as optional metrics.\r\nBut they are not displayed because they are made `display: none` in css and there are no way to appear them.\r\n\r\nI know #22595 also try to resolve this issue but that will use `additional-metrics.js`.\r\nInitially, `additional-metrics.js` is created for `StagePage` but `StagePage` currently uses `stagepage.js` for its additional metrics to be toggle because `DataTable (one of jQuery plugins)` was introduced and we needed another mechanism to add/remove columns for additional metrics.\r\n\r\nNow that `ExecutorsPage` also uses `DataTable` so it might be better to introduce same mechanism as `StagePage` for additional metrics.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-08-10 05-37-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/62807960-c4240f80-bb31-11e9-8e1a-1a44e2f91597.png)\r\n\r\nAnd then, we can remove `additional-metrics.js` which is no longer used from anywhere.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAfter this change is applied, I confirmed `ExecutorsPage` and `StagePage` are properly rendered and all checkboxes for additional metrics work.","created_at":"2019-08-07T09:08:28Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T20:32:28Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T00:07:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85cb86a719e0c92dcbde06b94ff7129e88a532db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, on requesting summary metrics, cached data are returned if the current number of \"SUCCESS\" tasks is the same as the value in cached data.\r\nHowever, the number of \"SUCCESS\" tasks is wrong when there are running tasks. In `AppStatusStore`, the KVStore is `ElementTrackingStore`, instead of `InMemoryStore`. The value count is always the number of \"SUCCESS\" tasks + \"RUNNING\" tasks.\r\nThus, even when the running tasks are finished, the out-of-update cached data is returned.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the code in getting the number of \"SUCCESS\" tasks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest manually, run \r\n```\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 160, 40).map(i => Thread.sleep(i*100)).collect()\r\n```\r\nand keep refreshing the stage page , we can see the task summary metrics is wrong.\r\n\r\n### Before

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix `CheckCartesianProducts.isCartesianProduct` so that\r\n1) when left or right side table can broadcast, then do not raise `Detected implicit cartesian product...` exception. (because we will use broadcast nested loop join)\r\n2) when left or right side table both cannot broadcast and join conditions do not include equi-condition, then raise `Detected implicit cartesian product...` exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test added.\r\n\r\nManual test by:\r\n\r\nProviding\r\n```\r\nspark.range(2).createOrReplaceTempView(\"sm1\") // can be broadcast\r\nspark.range(50000000).createOrReplaceTempView(\"bg1\") // cannot be broadcast\r\nspark.range(60000000).createOrReplaceTempView(\"bg2\") // cannot be broadcast\r\n```\r\nand suppose `spark.sql.crossJoin.enabled=false`\r\n\r\n### Test1\r\nRun\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"select sm1.id, bg1.id from bg1 join sm1 where sm1.id < bg1.id\").explain\r\n```\r\n**Before**:\r\n`Detected implicit cartesian product...` exception raised.\r\n**After**:\r\nPrint correct sql plan like:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(3) Project [id#10L, id#0L]\r\n+- BroadcastNestedLoopJoin BuildRight, Inner, (id#10L < id#0L)\r\n   :- *(1) Range (0, 50000000, step=1, splits=1)\r\n   +- BroadcastExchange IdentityBroadcastMode\r\n      +- *(2) Range (0, 2, step=1, splits=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test2\r\nRun\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"select bg2.id, bg1.id from bg1 join bg2 where bg2.id < bg1.id\").explain\r\n```\r\n**Before**\r\nPrint planner include Cartesian join (BUT we expect a `Detected implicit cartesian product...` exception raised):\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(3) Project [id#0L, id#2L]\r\n+- CartesianProduct (id#0L < id#2L)\r\n   :- *(1) Range (0, 50000000, step=1,

`ExtractPythonUDFFromJoinCondition` is matched to existing Python UDF extraction rules.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve the `merge-spark-pr` script in the following two ways.\r\n1. `[WIP]` is useful when we show that a PR is not ready for merge. Apache Spark allows merging `WIP` PRs. However, sometime, we accidentally forgot to clean up the title for the completed PRs. We had better warn once more during merging stage and get a confirmation from the committers.\r\n2. We have two kinds of PR titles in terms of the ending period. This PR aims to remove the trailing `dot` since the shorter is the better in the commit title. Also, the PR titles without the trailing `dot` is dominant in the Apache Spark commit logs.\r\n```\r\n$ git log --oneline | grep '[.]$' | wc -l\r\n    4090\r\n$ git log --oneline | grep '[^.]$' | wc -l\r\n   20747\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual.\r\n```\r\n$ dev/merge_spark_pr.py\r\ngit rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD\r\nWhich pull request would you like to merge?

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new write API as proposed in the [SPIP to standardize logical plans](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23521). This new API:\r\n\r\n* Uses clear verbs to execute writes, like `append`, `overwrite`, `create`, and `replace` that correspond to the new logical plans.\r\n* Only creates v2 logical plans so the behavior is always consistent.\r\n* Does not allow table configuration options for operations that cannot change table configuration. For example, `partitionedBy` can only be called when the writer executes `create` or `replace`.\r\n\r\nHere are a few example uses of the new API:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").append()\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").overwrite($\"date\" === \"2019-06-01\")\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").overwritePartitions()\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").asParquet.create()\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").partitionedBy(days($\"ts\")).createOrReplace()\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").using(\"abc\").replace()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded `DataFrameWriterV2Suite` that tests the new write API.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA GROUPED_AGG pandas python udf can't work, if without group by clause, like `select udf(id) from table`.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't match with aggregate function like sum, count..., and also dataset API like `df.agg(udf(df['id']))`.\r\n\r\nWhen we parse a udf (or an aggregate function) like that from SQL syntax, it is known as a function in a project. `GlobalAggregates` rule in analysis makes such project as aggregate, by looking for aggregate expressions. At the moment, we should also look for GROUPED_AGG pandas python udf.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.","created_at":"2019-08-04T18:03:28Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:22:46Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T15:37:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0cc14e01973fbf9fd64587bc100e7fe97cd4618","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25352/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25352/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25352/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2c6cd2013d0a737b7ea0d4a338082489a833790d","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-28422","ref":"SPARK-28422","sha":"2c6cd2013d0a737b7ea0d4a338082489a833790d","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a V1 fallback interface for writing to V2 Tables using V1 Writer interfaces. The only supported SaveMode that will be called on the target table will be an Append. The target table must use V2 interfaces such as `SupportsOverwrite` or `SupportsTruncate` to support Overwrite operations. It is up to the target DataSource implementation if this operation can be atomic or not.\r\n\r\nWe do not support dynamicPartitionOverwrite, as we cannot call a `commit` method that actually cleans up the data in the partitions that were touched through this fallback.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill add tests and example implementation after comments + feedback. This is a proposal at this point.","created_at":"2019-08-03T22:25:12Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T09:25:46Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T09:25:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95303b36049daacae2640af280553bb48e71dc82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27598ce9b5ef7bc8224e37df6f14907e766ddd54","head":{"label":"brkyvz:v1WriteFallback","ref":"v1WriteFallback","sha":"27598ce9b5ef7bc8224e37df6f14907e766ddd54","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf `spark.sql.arithmeticOperations.failOnOverFlow` is `true` temporary overflows in sum of long values cause an exception. This is against what other RDBMS do. The root cause is that we use a long attribute to store the intermediate result of a sum of longs: so if there is an intermediate value which is our of the range representable by long, an exception is raised.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a flag which allows to control the datatype of the intermediate attribute of sum of long. When the flag is set to `true`, intermediate buffer is a decimal, so temporary overflows don't cause any issue. The flag has been introduced on @cloud-fan 's suggestion because as [he pointed out](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21599#discussion_r308722618), using always a decimal as intermediate buffer would cause a performance regression.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\ntl;dr The essential logic is in this [rule](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25346/files#diff-57b3d87be744b7d79a9beacf8e5e5eb2R222)\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to work on the long-existing issue on reference binding for Aggregate's grouping expression, which was discussed in more detail in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25914. The issue itself is more of a correctness issue.\r\n\r\nBasically, it's a bad idea to put reference binding in the Analyzer's large resolution batch, since `Aggregate`'s content is not stable and resolution invariants are fragile and subtle (for example, `ResolveAggAliasInGroupBy` and `ResolveMissingReferences` are pretty tricky).\r\n\r\nTherefore it's wiser put grouping expression binding at the end of the analysis phase, and after this binding, all `Aggregate`s are replaced with `RealAggregate` (ignore this silly name... I'll think about a better name). However, there are still a few rules in `finishAnalysis` that is relevant for generating a _correct_ analyzed plan, we still have to deal with those rules. The above scenario also applies to optimizer rules that are related to aggregates.\r\n\r\nThis PR has the following tentative roadmap:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement reference binding for grouping

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange mapping of BYTETYPE from BYTE to TinyINT. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWriting dataframe with column type BYTETYPE fails when using JDBC connector for SQL Server. The problem is due to \r\n-  (Write path) Incorrect mapping of BYTETYPE in getCommonJDBCType() in jdbcutils.scala where BYTETYPE gets mapped to BYTE text. It should be mapped to TINYINT\r\n    case ByteType => Option(JdbcType(\"BYTE\", java.sql.Types.TINYINT))\r\n\r\nIn getCatalystType() ( JDBC to Catalyst type mapping) TINYINT is mapped to INTEGER, while it should be mapped to BYTETYPE. Mapping to integer is ok from the point of view of upcasting, but will lead to 4 byte allocation rather than 1 byte for BYTETYPE.\r\n\r\n- (read path) Read path ends up calling makeGetter(dt: DataType, metadata: Metadata). The function sets the value in RDD row. The value is set per the data type. Here there is no mapping for BYTETYPE and thus results will result in an error when getCatalystType() is fixed.\r\n\r\nNote : These issues were found when reading/writing with SQLServer. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPath was tested with integration test by adding test case to MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite.scala. Test case passed on local tests.","created_at":"2019-08-03T01:45:16Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T03:42:19Z","closed_at":"2019-11-14T03:42:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f254a524eaa64ab5b64ec3501b4f8f5b3ae9aa80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25344/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25344/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25344/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec5315d9ec600547cadc30861636159f25e33afc","head":{"label":"shivsood:byteType_fix_pr","ref":"byteType_fix_pr","sha":"ec5315d9ec600547cadc30861636159f25e33afc","user":{"login":"shivsood","id":1579057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzkwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1579057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood","html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192983938,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI5ODM5Mzg=","name":"spark","full_name":"shivsood/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shivsood","id":1579057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzkwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1579057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood","html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood/spark","description":"Apache
