when using WriteToFiles in a streaming pipeline in Dataflow, there are missing events. The reason seems to be a race condition that makes some files to be deleted from the temporary folder before moving them to the destination.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12950\r\n\r\nThe easiest and safest approach right now would be to not delete any files and log a message to warn that some files might be left orphaned in the temporary folder. Eventually, in the next execution, that orphaned file will be moved to the destination, so we don’t lose any event. In addition, the log level should be always INFO, because Dataflow doesn’t accept DEBUG.level. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

approach for PulsarIO, still working on SDF. \r\n\r\nSubmitting this PR as DRAFT, in order to \r\n1 - get feedback about the initial approach for SDF with PulsarIO\r\n2 - validate if restrictions are good\r\n3 - discuss about GetSize and Watermark. \r\n\r\nRestrictions for SDF that i am considering are the MessageId which is who PulsarIO manage the offsets. Each MessageId is incremental but not necessarily sequential (e.g. 3066338213929, 3066338213930, 3066338213931, 3208340570112, 3633810767872, 3633810767873) since MessageId is a combinations of id's (in this case entry id and ledger id to make a unique message id). I am converting the MessageId into an offset with Pulsar default utils. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Not sure what I would unit test ( I guess a config and ensure that can submit a job without an error with the config desired)?  Does this warrant a full Integration Test, along the lines of:  https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryTimePartitioningClusteringIT.java ( but perhaps just https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryClusteringIT.java with a job that does only clustering )?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Python 3.9 the use of [ _field_types in NamedTuples is full deprecated](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html#removed) in favor of `__annotations__` and is the cause of `IndexError`  exceptions

Make `ReadFromBigQuery` submit queries with BATCH priority by default. This mirrors the default behavior in the [Java BigQueryIO](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/v2.32.0/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIO.java#L908) and the legacy native Dataflow IO.\r\n* Add a `query_priority` parameter to `ReadFromBigQuery` to allow toggling between INTERACTIVE and BATCH priority. Add a corresponding `BigQueryQueryPriority` object to hold the priority constants.\r\n\r\nSubmitting BigQuery queries with BATCH priority allows queries to be started when idle resources are available and allows queries submitted from Beam to not count toward a project's concurrent rate limit.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
