Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2402 and Fixes #2188 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe method testPostRequestFormat tries to connect to an external site: http://httpbin.org which is Echo server which will reply back with whatever has been sent.\r\nBut the end-point sometimes gives out 504, ie. gateway timeout.\r\n\r\nThis makes the test unstable. So add the check to see if status is OK, then only validate the rest of the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nmvn test output:\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testNoThrottleOnDisabledInstance:231->setupEnvironment:317->setupCluster:436 » ZkClient\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestDelayedAutoRebalance.testDisableDelayRebalanceInResource:169->validateDelayedMovements:310 expected:<true> but was:<false> \r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceThreadpoolSize.testBatchMessageThreadPoolSize:206 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1331, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 2\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-13T15:08:25Z","updated_at":"2023-06-23T23:06:39Z","closed_at":"2023-06-23T23:06:37Z","merged_at":"2023-06-23T23:06:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb8d27f7fb4f4993bf266409f45f6f151304b651","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/34491fcab7df6346de82127d287e26fc3cd2cf54","head":{"label":"desaikomal:pr-2402","ref":"pr-2402","sha":"34491fcab7df6346de82127d287e26fc3cd2cf54","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2230 and Fixes #2420 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nTaskExecutor is internally uses _batchMessageExecutorService when batch mode is enabled. This threadpool is of type newCachedThreadPool().\r\n\r\nnewCachedThreadPool - Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads when they are available.\r\n\r\nThe test creates 10 database resources and the check is to see if it pool size is 10 or more. This is not invariant. It will depend.\r\n\r\nRemoving the assert as it is not invariant.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nmvn test in progress\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-12T22:30:22Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T18:32:33Z","closed_at":"2023-06-13T18:32:33Z","merged_at":"2023-06-13T18:32:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"729bc40fbec946ff73515dd08a8245598c17ddd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/4a6c77022e54ee093522d344bad1d98c193505d2","head":{"label":"desaikomal:pr-2230","ref":"pr-2230","sha":"4a6c77022e54ee093522d344bad1d98c193505d2","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Create 3 resource, 10 partition, 3 replicas - each with default weight of 6. \r\nCluster is super tight.\r\nAdd an instance, so capacity become 700\r\nChange the default weight for one resource to 10, this will cause partition movements where n - n+1 contraint in intermediate state is not satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead implemented the ideal-state delta. \r\nIf a partition is moving from one host to another, i double accounted that partition on source host as well as new host as that it what will happen during intermediate stage.\r\n\r\n[TestNG] Running:\r\n  /Users/kdesai/Library/Caches/JetBrains/LinkedInIdea222/temp-testng-customsuite.xml\r\n\r\nStart zookeeper at localhost:2183 in thread main\r\n\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpected :true\r\nActual   :false\r\n<Click to see difference>\r\n\r\n\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:480)\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:37)\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:47)\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.WagedRebalancer.TestWagedRebalanceHardConstraint.validateIdealState(TestWagedRebalanceHardConstraint.java:299)\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.WagedRebalancer.TestWagedRebalanceHardConstraint.testIncreaseResourcePartitionWeight(TestWagedRebalanceHardConstraint.java:201)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:566)\r\n\tat org.testng.internal.MethodInvocationHelper.invokeMethod(MethodInvocationHelper.java:76)\r\n\tat org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeMethod(Invoker.java:673)\r\n\tat org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeTestMethod(Invoker.java:846)\r\n\tat org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeTestMethods(Invoker.java:1170)\r\n\tat org.testng.internal.TestMethodWorker.invokeTestMethods(TestMethodWorker.java:125)\r\n\tat org.testng.internal.TestMethodWorker.run(TestMethodWorker.java:109)\r\n\tat org.testng.TestRunner.runWorkers(TestRunner.java:1147)\r\n\tat org.testng.TestRunner.privateRun(TestRunner.java:749)\r\n\tat org.testng.TestRunner.run(TestRunner.java:600)\r\n\tat org.testng.SuiteRunner.runTest(SuiteRunner.java:317)\r\n\tat org.testng.SuiteRunner.runSequentially(SuiteRunner.java:312)\r\n\tat org.testng.SuiteRunner.privateRun(SuiteRunner.java:274)\r\n\tat org.testng.SuiteRunner.run(SuiteRunner.java:223)\r\n\tat org.testng.SuiteRunnerWorker.runSuite(SuiteRunnerWorker.java:52)\r\n\tat org.testng.SuiteRunnerWorker.run(SuiteRunnerWorker.java:86)\r\n\tat org.testng.TestNG.runSuitesSequentially(TestNG.java:1039)\r\n\tat org.testng.TestNG.runSuitesLocally(TestNG.java:964)\r\n\tat org.testng.TestNG.run(TestNG.java:900)\r\n\tat com.intellij.rt.testng.IDEARemoteTestNG.run(IDEARemoteTestNG.java:66)\r\n\tat com.intellij.rt.testng.RemoteTestNGStarter.main(RemoteTestNGStarter.java:109)\r\n\r\nAfterClass: TestWagedRebalanceHardConstraint called.\r\nShut down zookeeper at port 2183 in thread main\r\n\r\n===============================================\r\nDefault Suite\r\nTotal tests run: 2, Failures: 1, Skips: 0\r\n===============================================\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess finished with exit code 0\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\ntestIncreaseResourcePartitionWeight()\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n- mvn test completed:\r\n- [ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testNoThrottleOnDisabledInstance:231->setupEnvironment:317->setupCluster:436 » ZkClient\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestDelayedAutoRebalance.testDisableDelayRebalanceInResource:169->validateDelayedMovements:310 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceThreadpoolSize.testBatchMessageThreadPoolSize:206 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1331, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 2\r\n\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

So increased the timeout.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTesting done: since this is CI failure, ran into my private branch 3/4 times https://github.com/desaikomal/helix/actions/workflows/Helix-PR-CI.yml\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2237 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR changes an undetermined assertion in unit test.\r\nReason for undetermined assertion is because when subscribe one time watcher on a path with existing persist watcher, we know there will be event missing but the number of event is not determined. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-01T16:25:59Z","updated_at":"2023-06-01T22:55:22Z","closed_at":"2023-06-01T22:55:22Z","merged_at":"2023-06-01T22:55:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"093d60799468ee8d2010376736b892ddcd6b89d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2516/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2516/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2516/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/481acbfdd33ef1ae6131e57773dd858c2515591c","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:recursivePersistImpl","ref":"recursivePersistImpl","sha":"481acbfdd33ef1ae6131e57773dd858c2515591c","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2237\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImplementation of the Distributed Semaphore in Lattice.\r\n\r\nThe functionality of the distributed semaphore is as following:\r\n- A user creates /connects a semaphore client and can either create or \"access\" a semaphore (a znode). A semaphore has an initial capacity and a remaining capacity.\r\n- The user then can acquire a \"Permit\", or ownership of the semaphore, essentially acting as a shared lock. \r\n- The remaining capacity of the semaphore is reduced. If there is no capacity left, a user can not acquire a permit unless one is returned.\r\n\r\nThe permit object acts as a ticket or ownership of a semaphore. When the permit is returned, it is invalidated by a flag (_isacquired object variable).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nUnit tests testing the behavior and functionality of DistributedSemaphore acquire and return methods as well as the creation of the SemaphoreClient and Permit object. Tests under: `TestDistributedSemaphore.java`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-30T22:30:14Z","updated_at":"2023-06-23T23:12:24Z","closed_at":"2023-06-23T23:12:23Z","merged_at":"2023-06-23T23:12:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2737c6200a1cb9a6cbaa157118d163805de0674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2515/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2515/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2515/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/7135bb4674a3efb612a5128aa3a83180f9956f7a","head":{"label":"Marcosrico:semaphoreInterface","ref":"semaphoreInterface","sha":"7135bb4674a3efb612a5128aa3a83180f9956f7a","user":{"login":"Marcosrico","id":55266861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55266861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico","html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":530316861,"node_id":"R_kgDOH5v-PQ","name":"helix","full_name":"Marcosrico/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Marcosrico","id":55266861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55266861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico","html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2521 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe currently don't handle the case where if the user has only one replica and the leader partition comes back on the same host as there are no other replica.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTesting done:\r\nAdded a test scenario in the JSON config file where the partition is brought oneline on the same host and validated that the test passes.\r\n\r\nTestTopStateHandoffMetrics::failed configuration has one additional test scenario added. \r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\nmvn test is in progress (it got interrupted, so will send it once completes)\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testNoThrottleOnDisabledInstance:231->setupEnvironment:317->setupCluster:436 » ZkClient\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkConnectionLost.testDisconnectWhenConnectionBreak:140 » ThreadTimeout Met...\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkConnectionLost.testLostZkConnection:179 » Helix Workflow testLostZkConne...\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterMaintenanceMode.testMaintenanceHistory:412 expected:<EXIT> but was:<ENTER>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.testDeletingRecurrentQueueWithHistory:298 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-30T17:16:52Z","updated_at":"2023-06-05T19:50:08Z","closed_at":"2023-06-05T19:50:07Z","merged_at":"2023-06-05T19:50:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"2568f4a37a497ade21d9d680d2d0e094600bebd2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/90d3b081934d48043d67eef7bef79b01e467c513","head":{"label":"desaikomal:helix-4888","ref":"helix-4888","sha":"90d3b081934d48043d67eef7bef79b01e467c513","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #325 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn TaskStateModelFactory class, we want to name our thread with a sequence number to uniquely identify threads. The mechanics can be simplified by using the BasicThreadPoolFactory which has way for explicitly naming the thread. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nmvn -q test run is in progress, will update it as soon as I get the results.\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-24T17:31:35Z","updated_at":"2023-05-26T00:25:54Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T00:25:53Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T00:25:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ff1033891511e8b15b4a2bd3f2338c5efb6dba3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2507/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2507/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2507/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/df3b850bc7b2044e0f835e0e39257751a3d7752b","head":{"label":"desaikomal:pr-325","ref":"pr-325","sha":"df3b850bc7b2044e0f835e0e39257751a3d7752b","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2485 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhile debugging the failure for the test case in DistributedController test case, realized we are using deprecated verifier. So let us first use the right verifier and see if it helps with resolving the temporary failures. These are all integration tests which depends on ZK timing and so not sure if just replacing correct verifier will help. But first order problem is to use right code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nI created a branch and ran the test 4 times to make sure that there is no regression with using different verifier.\r\nHere is the link to the branch with testing:\r\nhttps://github.com/desaikomal/helix/pull/2\r\n- failure were in different test cases.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-24T06:53:54Z","updated_at":"2023-05-27T01:07:20Z","closed_at":"2023-05-27T01:07:20Z","merged_at":"2023-05-27T01:07:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2d19e6c29e23c3c90f7a24a708684ee5c6849a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/a70739a9477fffbe0d2445a40bd21fe48f266e60","head":{"label":"desaikomal:fix-2485","ref":"fix-2485","sha":"a70739a9477fffbe0d2445a40bd21fe48f266e60","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2503 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe test waits for the update and what is the cache. At the end of the day, callbacks are asynchronous and sometimes they don't get the same count.\r\nIncreased the attempts from 10 to 20. The test doesn't wait by default. Instead if results matches, it will break quickly. Only when things are not converging, it will iterate more.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nI ran the same test through different branch, thanks @xyuanlu for showing how to run the test.\r\nhttps://github.com/desaikomal/helix/pull/1 - i have run successfully couple of times (not exactly 20 times).\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-24T06:40:40Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T18:08:21Z","closed_at":"2023-05-30T18:08:20Z","merged_at":"2023-05-30T18:08:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"20cc6ba0d4d3430438acabaf2ad937a0633d569e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/ee0211137b28c0311202a6127295a0d99b1a03c3","head":{"label":"desaikomal:fix-2503","ref":"fix-2503","sha":"ee0211137b28c0311202a6127295a0d99b1a03c3","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Summary\r\n\r\nAdd support for pluggable external CloudInfoProcessor and CustomizedCloudProperties.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#200 - Link your issue number here: You can write \"Fixes #XXX\". Please use the proper keyword so that the issue gets closed automatically. See https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue\r\nAny of the following keywords can be used: close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHelix currently has cloud support for Azure and CUSTOMIZED cloud provider. In the current state it is difficult to take advantage of CUSTOMIZED cloud provider, as Helix is only able to load implementations of CloudInstanceInfoProcessor which are in `org.apache.helix.cloud.`. This means that folks who wish to implement custom CloudInstanceInfoProcessor need to fork apache/helix add their custom implementation and consume the forked version.\r\n\r\nTo make CUSTOMIZED cloud provider more flexible, we can allow the dynamic import of any class implementing CloudInstanceInfoProcessor on the classpath. This will allow consumers to write their custom implementation as a separate dependency from apache/helix.\r\n\r\nUsers can leverage this feature by specifying the fully qualified class name in the `CLOUD_INFO_PROCESSOR_NAME` cloud-config. This can be updated using the helix-rest:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://helix-rest/admin/v2/clusters/myCluster/addCloudConfig -d '\r\n{\r\n    \"simpleFields\": \r\n    {\r\n        \"CLOUD_ENABLED\": \"true\",\r\n        \"CLOUD_PROVIDER\": \"CUSTOMIZED\",\r\n        \"CLOUD_INFO_SOURCE\": [\"some_source\"],\r\n        \"CLOUD_INFO_PROCESSOR_NAME\": \"com.foo.bar.cloudinfo.CustomInstanceInformationProcessor\"\r\n    }\r\n}'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] TestInstanceAutoJoin#testAutoRegistrationCustomizedFullyQualifiedInfoProcessorPath: Added an end to end integration test which validates custom implementation is dynamically located and properly populates DOMAIN field in instance config\r\n- [x] TestHelixCloudProperty: Added a test for HelixCloudProperty when loading Azure and CUSTOM CloudConfigs\r\n\r\n./scripts/runSingleTest.sh TestInstanceAutoJoin#testAutoRegistrationCustomizedFullyQualifiedInfoProcessorPath 10\r\nAll were passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- (If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.) -->\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nChange is not backwards incompatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n -->\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2438\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhile looking at the failed test run logs it was observed that one of the rebalance operations (the third rebalance call) was not getting invoked. The assertions to verify the MockViewClusterSpectator state failed after the `Thread.sleep() `expired. The likely hypothesis is that the timeout duration of 7 seconds was not sufficient for the ClusterSpectator state to reach steady state. So instead of leveraging `Thread.sleep() `to wait for the cluster to reach steady state in this PR we are using `TestHelper.verify` to check for the desired state.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWaged - Constraint based algorithm has few corner cases where the hard-constraint is not satisfied. Details are documented at Wiki: https://github.com/apache/helix/wiki/WAGED-rebalancer-Hard-Constraint-Scope-Expansion\r\n\r\nGoogle doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uxCqSU0xriUTdZIyxVoEvPMvywRgHCANatUlR0YQojk/edit#\r\n\r\nOriginal proposal was to throttle the ST mesages in intermediate state calculation stage. The alternate proposal is to it in BestPossibleCalcStage() but after the actual calculations are done. This is done later as we don't want to cause ping-pong effect as part of the Baseline or Partial Pipeline calculations.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a data provider, InstanceCapacity which will take into consideration pending messages on the instances.\r\n\r\nPart-2 will introduce the change where this will be used in DelayedAutoRebalancer.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\nTestWagedRebalancer.testInstanceCapacityProvider\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n- [ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testNoThrottleOnDisabledInstance:231->setupEnvironment:317->setupCluster:436 » ZkClient\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterMaintenanceMode.testMaintenanceHistory:412 expected:<EXIT> but was:<ENTER>\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalanceFaultZone.testAddZone:270->validate:318->validateZoneAndTagIsolation:342 expected:<3> but was:<2>\r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalanceTopologyAware.testAddZone:112->TestWagedRebalanceFaultZone.testAddZone:288 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.testDeletingRecurrentQueueWithHistory:298 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceThreadpoolSize.testBatchMessageThreadPoolSize:206 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n* #2200, #2387\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n#### Brief overview of the integration test\r\nIn a nutshell, the integration test verifies that he metrics for the `ClusterStatus` are emitted correctly when participants/controller_participants are added/removed.\r\n\r\n#### What's the failure?\r\nTowards the end of the test, we disconnect all the controller from the super cluster and ensure that there are 0 metrics related to the `ClusterStatus` being emitted.\r\n\r\n#### Analysis\r\nUpon debugging the test failure from the logs, I found a race condition for the last controller `controller_9(CONTROLLER_PARTICIPANT) ` in the super cluster disconnect process which can be explained from the logs below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- Disconnect initiated for **controller_9[CONTROLLER_PARTICPANT]**\r\n2023-05-09T17:14:02.0244076Z 5813977 [ClusterManager_Watcher_CONTROLLER_TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle_controller_9_CONTROLLER_PARTICIPANT_11918] INFO  org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZKHelixManager [] - disconnect controller_9(CONTROLLER_PARTICIPANT) from CONTROLLER_TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle\r\n\r\n--- Message to become leader sent by the

TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle0::TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle0_9\r\n\r\n--- *controller_9** becomes leader for **TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle0_9** due to the StateModel transition\r\n2023-05-09T17:14:03.9794014Z 5815598 [HelixTaskExecutor-message_handle_STATE_TRANSITION] INFO  org.apache.helix.participant.AbstractHelixLeaderStandbyStateModel [] - Helix Service Controller for cluster TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle0_9 on instance controller_9 became LEADER from STANDBY\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the above logs, reset for `TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle0_9` happens before the `controller_9` transitions to being leader [NOTE: Timestamps are very close, and since it's separate thread trying to invoke different methods there is race over here too, which results in reset being processed first] for `TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle0_9` which results in disconnect being not [invoked](https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/1f5c5c82fb5bc8273f3d6e04b4cc245e77ece2c8/helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/participant/DistClusterControllerStateModel.java#L116) as reset only works if the controller is the leader for that resource partition. So, this leaves `controller_9` be the leader despite it's disconnected. \r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nWe should wait for the cluster to stabilize before we disconnect it especially when are taking controllers from the super cluster one after another. \r\n**NOTE: This is not fixing the actual race condition. Fixing the race condition will be prioritized later since it's a larger and complex effort.**\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nRan the `TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecyle` integration test locally 10 times in a loop successfully.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Small bug fixes related to ZK disconnect.\r\n    We added the fix where we retry with exponential backoff.\r\n    There are some new failures in the test because tests have become underministic wrt time to wait.\r\n    So let us remove randomness by explicitly waiting for thread to join.\r\n    Also, retryCount should start with 0 and then increment it.\r\n    This is the same behavior in other Exponential backoff call in other ZK API.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n    Testing Done: mvn test (in zookeeper-api as well as helix-core)\r\n    [ERROR] Failures:\r\n    [ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n    [ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testNoThrottleOnDisabledInstance:231->setupEnvironment:317->setupCluster:436 » ZkClient\r\n    [ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n    [ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeout.testStateTransitionTimeOut:170 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n    [ERROR]   TestWagedRebalanceTopologyAware.testAddZone:112->TestWagedRebalanceFaultZone.testAddZone:288 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n    [ERROR] Tests run: 1326, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2481 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\nThe testcase issues 'disconnect()' from a thread and in the main-thread waits for the status to get updated. It is possible that in disconnect() code path, there can be an exception and we never get to setting the status. Next line has Assert() in place to see if we actually disconnected or not.\r\nSo at least pass the first Assert() as it is created by test logic and not actual code logic.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\nmvn test logs\r\n--------------\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestParticipantFreeze.testUnfreezeParticipant:228 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalanceTopologyAware.testAddZone:112->TestWagedRebalanceFaultZone.testAddZone:270->TestWagedRebalanceFaultZone.validate:318->TestWagedRebalanceFaultZone.validateZoneAndTagIsolation:342 expected:<3> but was:<2>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.testDeletingRecurrentQueueWithHistory:298 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceThreadpoolSize.testBatchMessageThreadPoolSize:206 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1326, Failures: 6, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2299 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWithout the fix, the class `AssignableReplica` is breaking the contract in `Object.hashCode()`. If only override `equals()`, a hashset may contain two equaled objects. See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2265503/why-do-i-need-to-override-the-equals-and-hashcode-methods-in-java.\r\n\r\nOverriding hashCode() in `AssignableReplica` to make it consistent with `equals()`.\r\nAlso changing the appearance of `Set<AssignableReplica>` to `List`, which is the way it should be. In most use cases there is a collection of replicas with same (resource, partition, state), using hashset is confusing to start with.\r\n\r\nThis class is fundamental to WAGED rebalancer. Using list also has performance improvement over set.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1326, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6,965.344 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1326, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/qqu/workspace/qqu-helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 797 classes\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- maven-bundle-plugin:5.1.4:bundle (default-bundle) @ helix-core ---\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2237 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen Zk Client register a one time listener on a path hat has already a persist watcher registered. ZK will over write the persist watcher and only trigger event once when change happen. In Helix ZkClient, we should disable one time wacher registration when _usePersistWatcher is set to true.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestZooKeeperConnection.testPersistWatcher - test native zk client behavior\r\nTestZkClientPersistWatcher.testSubscribeOneTimeChangeWhenUsingPersistWatcher - test throw exception\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2468\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nImplement the very basic part of `CapacityBasedThrottler` in order to have finer control on state transitions, to avoid instance overloading.\r\nSimilar approach is done in WAGED rebalancer for calculating weights and capacity for partition placement, but that only counts for eventual state. Instance might get more during state transition. \r\nThe introduction of this new throttler aims to solve this problem, by dynamically computing the \"headroom\" and deciding how many additional state transitions are allowed. \r\nThis PR only introduce the throttler framework, two data provider interfaces are placeholders for future.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nNew test in `TestCapacityBasedThrottler.java`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nN/A. \r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Since we aren't fixing the actual issue I am marking this as N/A \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe need more context to debug the failing `TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecyle` integration test as we aren't able to reproduce the issue locally. So, we enable `INFO` level logging for `org.apache.helix` package. \r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This change will increase the log size for the tests from ~15 MB to ~50MB. We will revert the logging level back to `ERROR` once we fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2237\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nZkPathRecursiveWatcherTrie will be used as a registry of persistent recursive watchers. When persist recursive watcher is registered on path /X, ZK will send out data change for any data/child changing under the tree structure of /X. The event only include the path of changed ZNode. In ZkClient, when ever we get a dataChange event for path /X/Y/Z, we need to track back the path and notify all registered recursive persist listener and notify them about the node change.\r\nref: https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.7.1/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_WatchPersistentRecursive\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkPathRecursiveWatcherTrie\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 31.577 s - in org.apache.helix.messaging.handling.TestResourceThreadpoolSize\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn our internal test environment, we ran into a bug where during actual ZK connection disconnect,  the Apache ZK client didn't get chance to mark the status of the ZK connection as disconnected as it was busy draining the outgoing message queue in its cleanup() method. \r\nHelix ZKClient provides a useful method to customer where we retryUntilConnected() - ie. we will keep retrying till the connection is re-established.  Lot of Helix CRUD operations use this underlying method. But in the above scenario where Apache ZK client didn't get a chance ever to clean up the queue, we will take long time to converge. \r\n\r\nFix is to retry the request after waiting using exponential back-off. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\ntestRetryUntilConnectedWithZkCleanupStuck() \r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n- The TestRawZKClient has been run in loop for 10 times. \r\n- mvn -q test (running in progres).\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\nRefactoring the testHelixViewAggregator by removing Thread.sleep and using awaitility within the TestHelper to specify a poll frequency for verifications.\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2438\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhile looking at the failed test run logs it was observed that one of the rebalance operations (the third rebalance call) was not getting invoked. The assertions to verify the MockViewClusterSpectator state failed after the `Thread.sleep() `expired. The likely hypothesis is that the timeout duration of 7 seconds was not sufficient for the ClusterSpectator state to reach steady state. So instead of leveraging `Thread.sleep() `to wait for the cluster to reach steady state in this PR we are using `TestHelper.verify` to check for the desired state.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] T E S T S\r\n[INFO]

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2237\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImplementation of LockClient.\r\nLockClient creates a node using the underlying datastore, in this case ZK, with data type LockInfo. User can acquire and release a lock, renew it (if it is of type TTL) and retrieve it.\r\n\r\nA LockInfo object contains important metadata about the lock. This object extends the DataRecord object, a wrapper to the ZNRecord object. LockClient serializes LockInfo using ZNRecord serializer as that is the only serializer currently implemented that works. In the future we would like to make a generic metaClientSerializer (see PR code for details).\r\n\r\nMetaClientFactory, also modified, takes in a generic MetaClientConfig and depending on the dataStore, creates that specific client configuration. Currently, only ZooKeeper is supported, so it will create a ZkMetaClientConfig.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nUnit tests testing the behavior and functionality of LockClient acquire, release, renew, and retrieve methods as well as the creation of the LockClient object. Tests under: `TestLockClient.java`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-20T21:10:10Z","updated_at":"2023-05-22T21:51:04Z","closed_at":"2023-05-22T21:51:04Z","merged_at":"2023-05-22T21:51:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"7aafc9d55fc447d392692995e3bdb58415a1b86c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/f1662804e6f1c4b9f080dd2936a514d952544f1d","head":{"label":"Marcosrico:metaclient","ref":"metaclient","sha":"f1662804e6f1c4b9f080dd2936a514d952544f1d","user":{"login":"Marcosrico","id":55266861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55266861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico","html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":530316861,"node_id":"R_kgDOH5v-PQ","name":"helix","full_name":"Marcosrico/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Marcosrico","id":55266861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55266861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico","html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nStarting a ZK server is very time consuming and it's affecting the time taken to debug the integration tests since each test run starts ZK. This PR aims to optimise the start time.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently `ZkServer.start()` queries all of the network interfaces to find if `localhost` is present in the interfaces whereas it will always be present since we manually add [localhost](https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/386a77d566f1dc0b480c3bcbdb4a2880a8b8a4a9/zookeeper-api/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/zookeeper/zkclient/NetworkUtil.java#L43) to the list of resolved network ips and hostnames.  The call to `NetworkUtil.getLocalhostNames()` is expensive and it is the reason for the increased time to start the Zk server. We also invoke the same method twice one just for logging and other for verifying 😞 \r\n\r\nSince ZKServer never accepts a Zk hostname to connect, the check to verify if the port is busy should be sufficient. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nSince this is a helper class, no unit tests exist for this class.

Issues\r\n\r\nbug=[HELIX-4677](https://jira01.corp.linkedin.com:8443/browse/HELIX-4677)\r\n\r\n- [x] fixes #2404 \r\n- [x] fixes #2229 \r\n- [x] fixes #1979 \r\n- [x] fixes #1832\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Fixing Flaky Unit Test TestClusterAccessor#testClusterFreeze\r\n\r\n#### What is this test doing? \r\n\r\nThis integration test is making a POST request to helix-rest to place cluster TestCluster_0 into CLUSTER_FREEZE status. It then attempts to verify that the following GET request for clusterStatus is in CLUSTER_FREEZE mode.\r\n\r\n#### Why is this test likely flaky?\r\n\r\nFollowing the POST request, we check that the `pauseSignal` which we added exists under the CONTROLLER znode, this will succeed because this znode is written to before the POST responds.\r\n\r\nThe next test is to see if the `clusterMode` is in `CLUSTER_FREEZE`. We also check if the `clusterStatus` is either `IN_PROGRESS` or `COMPLETED`(meaning all state transitions are either canceled or completed and participants are now frozen/paused). The reason the GET request can sometimes return `clusterMode == NORMAL` is because the verification we are doing before we make the GET request is not a definitive signal that the `PAUSE` signal has caused the `clusterMode` to change to `CLUSTER_FREEZE`. This is because a `clusterPause` signal/event has to be enqueued to the `_managementModeEventQueue` and processed before we make the GET for `clusterStatus`. Until it has been processed, the `clusterStatus` will be NORMAL.\r\n\r\nPreviously we were running this verification to check if the clusterStatus znode existed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTestHelper.verify(() -> dataAccessor.getBaseDataAccessor()\r\n        .exists(dataAccessor.keyBuilder().clusterStatus().getPath(), AccessOption.PERSISTENT),\r\n    TestHelper.WAIT_DURATION);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will not necessarily indicate that the pause event has been processed, as there could be an earlier event passed through the `_managementEventPipeline` that causes the znode to be created with `clusterMode == NORMAL`. This would lead us to make the GET request too early and the test to fail here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssert.assertEquals(responseMap.get(\"mode\"), ClusterManagementMode.Type.CLUSTER_FREEZE.name());\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, we will verify that the `clusterStatus` znode has `CLUSTER_FREEZE` mode before we make the GET request. This will ensure that the pause event was already processed. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix TestClusterAccessor#testClusterFreeze successfully run 10x \r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n[x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nStarting a ZK server is very time consuming and it's affecting the productivity while debugging integration tests. This PR tries aims to optimise the start time.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Currently `ZkServer.start()` queries all of the network interfaces to find if `localhost` is present in the interfaces whereas it will always be present since we manually add [localhost](https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/386a77d566f1dc0b480c3bcbdb4a2880a8b8a4a9/zookeeper-api/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/zookeeper/zkclient/NetworkUtil.java#L43) to the list of resolved network ips and hostnames.  The call to `NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces` is very expensive and it is the reason for the increased time to start the Zk server. Also, the sad part is we invoke the same method twice one just for logging and other for verifying 😞 \r\n\r\nSince ZKServer never accepts a Zk hostname to connect the check to verify if the port is busy should be sufficient. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n[x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nSince this is a helper class, no unit tests exist for this class. However, integration tests and helix examples cover this path. I verified that Helix examples were running all good.\r\n\r\n[x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n[x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2441\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs the first PR to address the hard constraint issue during WAGED rebalance overwrites.\r\nThe general idea is to use WAGED constraint based algorithm to handle \"rebalance overwrites\" instead of applying blindly as a afterthought.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposed a new rebalance scope and its cluster model and a few util methods. This is NOT integrated yet with any current flow, so no behavior change with this PR.\r\n\r\nThe new rebalance scope:\r\n1. Assignable replicas are those partitions who miss minActiveReplicas, we need to bring up additional replicas for those.\r\n2. The additional replicas count is determined by current `numReplica`, `minActiveReplica`, and the corresponding state is by state model definition (state count map)\r\n3. Pre-allocate all current assignment on active nodes, so no existing assignment is changed\r\n\r\nEntry point for the logic is in `ClusterModelProvider::generateClusterModelForDelayedRebalanceOverwrites`, major new logic introduced in `DelayedRebalanceUtil.java`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nhelix-core/src/test/java/org/apache/helix/controller/rebalancer/waged/model/TestClusterModelProvider.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-11T16:00:18Z","updated_at":"2023-04-24T18:09:05Z","closed_at":"2023-04-17T19:00:30Z","merged_at":"2023-04-17T19:00:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b35383208625eff0ca6730a2923393c955c649d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d28f4af6ea7e28fb185806b2073a7219d39037f0","head":{"label":"qqu0127:waged-overwrites","ref":"waged-overwrites","sha":"d28f4af6ea7e28fb185806b2073a7219d39037f0","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nProbably Fixes #2192 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\nTheory - We test MultiZK configuration in two mode, dedicated and MSDS (Zooscalability). TestMultiZkHelixJavaApi - is focused on MSDS while ConnectionConfig is focused on dedicated ZK.\r\n\r\nTest is very unstable wrt \"testHelixManager\".\r\nIf MSDS based tests are run prior to Dedicated ZK, the test fails. we wanted to make sure that Dedicated ZK testcases run prior to MSDS and validate test passes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nSame test i ran in loop for 10 times:\r\nSTART TestMultiZkConnectionConfig_testZkRoutingDataSourceConfigs at Tue Apr 11 08:05:59 PDT 2023 END TestMultiZkConnectionConfig_testZkRoutingDataSourceConfigs at Tue Apr 11 08:06:11 PDT 2023\r\n ======================================================================\r\n Attempt 10 org.apache.helix.integration.multizk.TestMultiZkConnectionConfig\r\n ======================================================================\r\nStart zookeeper at localhost:8977 in thread main\r\nStart zookeeper at localhost:8978 in thread main\r\nStart zookeeper at localhost:8979 in thread main\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-11T15:39:11Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T17:04:37Z","closed_at":"2023-04-13T17:04:37Z","merged_at":"2023-04-13T17:04:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"8fac4b2594df3ae9846494f46afa0be4c16a1882","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/97f8108a5df5e40f8c07eb74739eff382f59e730","head":{"label":"desaikomal:multizk","ref":"multizk","sha":"97f8108a5df5e40f8c07eb74739eff382f59e730","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

The event only include the path of changed ZNode.\r\n\r\nIn ZkClient, when ever we get a dataChange event for path /X/Y/Z, we need to track back the path and notify all registered recursive persist listener and notify them about the node change.\r\nref: https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.7.1/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_WatchPersistentRecursive\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkPathRecursiveWatcherTrie\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-06T16:42:43Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T16:32:02Z","closed_at":"2023-04-06T21:19:06Z","merged_at":"2023-04-06T21:19:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd0d829fee636872641ac55f5b1407d4f4c8d446","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/a6b5ccf9f1ba11e765a903378c61377bdedb5e6c","head":{"label":"desaikomal:ci-failure","ref":"ci-failure","sha":"a6b5ccf9f1ba11e765a903378c61377bdedb5e6c","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2237\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBefore ZK 3.6, all zk watchers are one time watcher. ZkClient used to resubscribe every time when an event happens. \r\nThis change adopts ZK persist watcher. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n- TestUtil.java : A helper class in metaclient to get the ZK registered watcher and type\r\n- TestZkMetaClient:testDirectChildChangeListener, testDataChangeListener\r\n- TestZkClientPersistWatcher\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-05T06:51:55Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T16:29:55Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T16:29:54Z","merged_at":"2023-04-25T16:29:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"22144a78b09a64ef579309f289a4331c9cf90c1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/7efe6ffafb4c91af504d950135597866b6e03b59","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:testDataPersist_1","ref":"testDataPersist_1","sha":"7efe6ffafb4c91af504d950135597866b6e03b59","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

standalone classes for partial and global rebalance to make the class more modular and easier to manage.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2430\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRefactor `WagedRebalancer` by separating out components to their standalone classes.\r\nCurrently the WagedRebalancer class is complicated and contains multiple processes. With everything in one class, it's hard to read and even worse to manage complexity. \r\nCreating their classes for partial and global rebanace have a clear cut on responsibility, and make it possible for future refactoring toward microservices.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n1. Move partial and global rebalance process from WagedRebalancer to their own classes\r\n2. Remove process-specific member variables and methods from WagedRebalancer\r\n3. Add clarifying comments for partial and global rebalance.\r\n\r\nNo new logic is introduced, this PR is pure refactoring.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nExisting tests in `TestWagedRebalancer`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\nTest for `TestWagedRebalancer`\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.535 s - in org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.waged.TestWagedRebalancer\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/qqu/workspace/qqu-helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 936 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  40.842 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-04-03T15:42:46-04:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-03T19:43:40Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T04:54:17Z","closed_at":"2023-04-06T04:54:17Z","merged_at":"2023-04-06T04:54:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e93568d63d1d90b13d0e5fe43a9be5c84551025","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/90c365cfb1f81f8c13a4cb54da38db0de5a32a75","head":{"label":"qqu0127:waged-refactor","ref":"waged-refactor","sha":"90c365cfb1f81f8c13a4cb54da38db0de5a32a75","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2414 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR\r\nWe have seen afterClass(org.apache.helix.integration.multizk.TestMultiZkConnectionConfig) failing. The possible cause is that TestMultiZkHelixJavaApis re-initializes the _zkClient connection. Parent class TestMultiZkConnectionConfig already creates _zkClient in beforeClass().\r\n\r\nSo it is possible that we have dangling zkclient which in the afterClass cleanup causes the failure.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testNoThrottleOnDisabledInstance:231->setupEnvironment:317->setupCluster:436 » ZkClient\r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.stopDeleteJobAndResumeRecurrentQueue:123 » Helix Failed ...\r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.testDeletingRecurrentQueueWithHistory:298 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle.testClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle:297 Remaining MBeans:\r\n...\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1323, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M3:test (default-test) on project helix-core: There are test failures.\r\n[ERROR] \r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-23T12:32:26Z","updated_at":"2023-04-01T14:47:03Z","closed_at":"2023-03-25T20:58:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e508fd552e50a779c21ecc207935abbe512f5f74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/2b77f6a41935cf8fa2b62969dbe9f242505dbe8d","head":{"label":"desaikomal:bugs","ref":"bugs","sha":"2b77f6a41935cf8fa2b62969dbe9f242505dbe8d","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2237\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHad an offline discussion with other committers. \r\nSince operation retry waits for connect state change event, it will retry when reconnect succeeded and retry will be canceled when reconnect errored or timed out. There is no need to have 2 configurable timeout for CRUD operation retry and reconnect retry.\r\nThis change remove crud operation retry timeout.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2237\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nImplementing TTL node create and renew methods. The `expiry_time` instance variable in the `MetaClient.Stat` is not implemented as the current way ZkClient is setup doesn't allow for it (needs a `ContainerManager`, see comment in `ZkMetaClientTestBase` for more information on this issue).  Ticket to fix the setup has been filed and will be picked up when there's available bandwidth.\r\n\r\nOther minor fixes and removal of unnecessary imports.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n`testCreateTTL()` and `testRenewTTL()` tests end to end behavior of a TTL node.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.
