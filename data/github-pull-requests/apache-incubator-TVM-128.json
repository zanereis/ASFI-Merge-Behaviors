is a followup of #2020 , this PR implemented the infrastructure to do backward folding of scale on axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\nFold the scaling of axis(usually caused by BatchNorm) into weight of conv2d in the past. For example\r\n\r\nOld:\r\n```\r\n%1 = conv2d(%1, %w, data_layout=\"NHWC\")\r\n%2 = multiply(%x, %scale)\r\n```\r\nTransformed:\r\n```\r\n# scale weight's output channel\r\n%1 = multiply(%w, expand_dims(%scale, axis=1, num_newaxis=3))\r\n%2 = conv2d(%x, %1, data_layout=\"NHWC\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther constant folding can fold the multiplication and we remove the scaling in the network.\r\n\r\n## The Algorithm\r\nThe general idea is similar to the Forward algorithm.  We pass additional argument ```(axes, scale)```, when doing transformation, to request the result to satisfy\r\n```\r\nresult = value\r\nfor i, k in enumerate(axes):\r\n   k-ith dimension of result *= i-th dimension of scale\r\n```\r\nThe problem is again we don;t want to blindly propagate scale backward it won't get consumed. So we run a forward \"preparation phase\", which propagates the demand of the potential axes scaling.\r\n\r\nThe new pass is more general than the FoldScaleAxis in nnvm\r\n- The new pass support arbitrary scaling of multiple axes(although the further implementation is necessary), which could be helpful in NHWCc case,\r\n- The new pass support folding backward into sum of two of conv2d, which was not possible in NNVM.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-29T00:04:08Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T02:44:10Z","closed_at":"2018-10-30T02:43:38Z","merged_at":"2018-10-30T02:43:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5103bbcdfba4170f8ba16f4cb373869cade8cca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/914438191c19ac02fc190686a4f93dfa236c2d34","head":{"label":"tqchen:master","ref":"master","sha":"914438191c19ac02fc190686a4f93dfa236c2d34","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen

is a first serious attempt to implement an NN related optimization pass on relay. This PR contains the following changes:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make squeeze's attrs numpy compatible\r\n- [x] Add option to type resolver to write back checked_type to type_annotation if the original one is None\r\n    - There could be some debate on whether we should do so, but it is in general helpful in NN optimizations, where later phase of optimization will rely on knowing types of all arguments  @jroesch \r\n- [x] Support a general FoldScaleAxis Forward \r\n   - This pass assumes that the program is in dataflow form and inlines all lets\r\n   - So far only forward direction is implemented.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this can serve as an example of how optimizations can be done in NNVMv2(relay) IR, and how the infrastructure of relay makes writing optimization in a more principled fashion.\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\nFold the scaling of axis(usually caused by BatchNorm) into weight of conv2d in the future. For example\r\n\r\nOld:\r\n```\r\n%1 = multiply(%x, %scale)\r\n%2 = conv2d(%1, %w, data_layout=\"NHWC\")\r\n```\r\nTransformed:\r\n```\r\n# scale weight's input channel\r\n%1 = multiply(%w, expand_dims(%scale, axis=1, num_newaxis=2))\r\n%2 = conv2d(%x, %1, data_layout=\"NHWC\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther constant folding can fold the multiplication and we remove the scaling in the network.\r\n\r\n## The Algorithm\r\nWhile so far only the forward direction is implemented. The general idea is that we transform Expr to tuple of ```(value, axes, scale)```, where the final result satisfies:\r\n```\r\nresult = value\r\nfor i, k in enumerate(axes):\r\n   k-ith dimension of result *= i-th dimension of scale\r\n```\r\nThen we can propagate this signal along and fold the scale if necessary.  However, it is possible that certain scale may never be consumed if there is no dense/conv2d that follow multiplication.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure all the scale we sent out can be consumed eventually, we run a backward \"preparation phase\", which propagates the demand of the potential axes scaling back to its input.\r\n\r\nThe new pass is more general than the FoldScaleAxis in

would like to be able to evaluate Relay's performance on an LSTM, particularly since Relay can directly incorporate control flow. However, I could not find a concise example of an LSTM in NNVM to port over. @merrymercy pointed me to his own prior implementation of an LSTM cell, which is what I ported over. \r\n\r\nHowever, in order to get this to match up with the other examples, I would also need to set up the rest of the network and load in a benchmark; I would appreciate any pointers as to how I could proceed, since I am not familiar with LSTMs. Namely, a pointer to NNVM implementations I could point over would be most helpful for being able to set up comparisons. (@tqchen, @merrymercy)\r\n\r\nI would also appreciate any advice on how to best present this example (e.g., references to include).\r\n\r\nEdit: Full disclosure, this variant of an LSTM is still an unrolled loop because we haven't merged in planned changes for abstract data types in Relay. Relay can currently handle a loop via recursion but without ADTs, it can't take in an arbitrary-length input

Add `update` to dispatchers so that `alter_op_layout` can provide config for updated operators.\r\n* Register NCHWc's `compute`, `schedule` and `args_to_workload` to autotvm\r\n\r\nThe whole process becomes,\r\n- Tuning: tune with origin workload, but users can choose to use NCHWc compute & schedule.\r\n- AlterLayout: extract config using origin workload, replace conv op with NCHWc implement, update dispatcher with NCHWc workload and config\r\n- Compute & schedule: normal way as in autotvm.

might cause TupleTypeNode to be printed incorrectly.\r\nit doesnt show in http://ci.tvm.ai:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/PR-1989/1/pipeline/141, but if you run it on local machine you will see what get compared being NodeBase and TupleType.\r\n\r\nAlso as a side thought can we write a giant macro that make sure everything get did right (all field get visited, typekey match, declare_node_type_info match, etc?) I can do some macro metaprogramming, so I can take up the work.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://docs.tvm.ai/contribute/ for useful information and tips.

The runtime just processes added function expanding arguments by \"var_arg\" and writes to file specific data, by default it is a stdout, but log file could be specified by env variable TVM_TRACE, also tracing process could be disable/enable.\r\nExample:\r\nexport TVM_TRACE=trace_log_file=path/to/file:process_tracing=1\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-24T11:31:41Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T06:46:34Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T06:44:28Z","merged_at":"2019-01-08T06:44:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"a12c556a08b7a6e19c313c2a1230002fc71f0de4","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

`dilate` is a separate operation and one has to call `dilate` + `conv2d` to compose dilated convolution. \r\nThe problems:\r\n* Sometimes it is better to combine both into a single operator because we may want to write the expresion of dilated convolution directly instread of constructing a dilated kernel and then call `compute_inline`.\r\n* The workload in AutoTVM does not reflect dilation. For example, we will use the same configuration for 5x5 kernel and 3x3 kernel with dilation=2 because they have the same workload.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `dilation` as a new argument to `conv2d` / `depthwise_conv2d`. If dilation is used, it will call `nn.dilate` internally in conv2d (like `nn.pad`). The workload is also updated.

PR recovers the testing API to construct the normal workloads in relay. It contains the following changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor ir_pass.free_vars to return vars in post-dfs order @MarisaKirisame \r\n   - This allows us to directly use this to list unbound vars, which corresponds to old nnvm.symbol.list_arguments\r\n- [x] Enable batch_norm to infer the type of the gamma, beta, moving_mean @slyubomirsky \r\n- [x] Disable node generic inheritance TupleWrapper\r\n   - This is because batch_norm API now returns a tuple, which differs from traditional batch_norm in the inference API\r\n   - This is a reasonable change as it makes batch_norm functional and opens for

[x] Introduce AttrsEqualHandler to enable customized equal comparator\r\n   - This enables remap of function shapeVar if necessary\r\n- [x] Rewrite AlphaEqual to support deep comparison into Attrs\r\n   - The Type and normal IndexExpr are compared with normal deep comparison\r\n   - The Relay::Expr is compared with graph equality by putting each equivalent pair into equal_map and only allow one equal node to be mapped from the source. This enforces the equality of the graph.\r\n- [x] Allow optional remapping of free_var, which exposes as graph_equal, and should be able to guarantee equality among serialized pairs.\r\n- [x] Move relay/pass/alpha_eq.cc-> relay/ir/alpha_equal.cc , as this is quite build into the core semantics of ir\r\n- [x] Move relay/pass/type_functor.h -> relay/ir/type_functor.h, merge type_visitor.h into type_functor.h\r\n\r\nIn general, the new functor style comparator is preferred over TypeVisitor, and maybe we want to update other implementations to this new style.

PR implements the evaluation machinery for Relay, including basic passes for lowering and transforming Relay programs to make them suitable for compilation. \r\n\r\n### Passes\r\n- [x] FuseOps, is a phase which implements the machinery for operator fusion, as well as marking defintions which can be fused and lowered. A future PR will complete the fusion pass by actually partitioning the ops like the NNVM algorithm.\r\n- [x] LowerOps, is a phase which collects the set of operations used by an expression and converts them into `LoweredFunc` using the appropriate TVM operator and schedule.\r\n\r\n### Interpreter\r\nThis PR ships a simple interpreter for Relay programs, which can be used as its reference semantics. \r\nThe interpretation of operator calls utilizes TVM compiled operators on CPU, but the evaluation of other expressions is naive.\r\n\r\n### TVM Graph Runtime.\r\n\r\nThis PR ships a compiler located in `to_tvm.py` which converts a Relay program into a TVM graph, as well as using the above passes to generate a `tvm::Module` enabling users to deploy a subset of Relay programs to the TVM RTS.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nWe ship some more tests for both the evaluator and the RTS, as well as a couple new cases for type inference.\r\n\r\nThis is blocked on #2026 and #2025.","created_at":"2018-10-22T20:05:23Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T04:39:38Z","closed_at":"2018-10-30T22:29:37Z","merged_at":"2018-10-30T22:29:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"10ea05e64508309e834f9b983037c96e3231e706","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

Fix onnx to nnvm converter part 1: Pad operator\r\n\r\nRemaining problems:\r\n\r\n- tvm don't support real shape operator, it is currently hacked by bypass with input symbol and use reshape_like to skip that. However, I found some ONNX models does actually do something to the Shape, in which case the current hack won't work\r\n- ONNX supports unsqueeze (N, ) to zero dim integer N, which is not supported by

is a clean refactor PR to attempt stablize the relay python IR building API, it also contains fixes and patches to enable text format. \r\n\r\nOne of the general guidelines behind this refactor are:\r\n\r\n- Minimum abstraction when possible (simplification of IRBuilder)\r\n- Python API consistency (env.merge->env.update)\r\n- Make ir_pass style consistent\r\n   - Expr is always the first argument\r\n   - Not require env to be present, when necessary, pass as a second argument\r\n\r\n## List of Changes\r\n- [x]  Simplify ir_builder to scope_builder cc @jroesch \r\n   -  ScopeBuilder is only used to build if and let scopes.\r\n   - Use relay.Function to build functions (single way to build functions)\r\n- [x] Rewrite all the test cases with the new style.\r\n- [x] Add text print test to each op, fix problems that surface due to the new testcases.\r\n- [x] Improve the BroadcastRel to handle symbolic case cc @jroesch \r\n- [x] Fix TupleWrapper cc @slyubomirsky \r\n    - To make sure python unpack works, we need to throw index error when there is out of bound access\r\n    - TupleWrapper cannot assume the input field is a tuple type\r\n- [x] Enable TulpleGetItem type inference with incomplete type\r\n- [x] Fix dead code elimination when type is bool cc @MarisaKirisame \r\n- [x] Fix LeakyReluAttrs  cc @siju-samuel \r\n- [x] Merge reduce tests into a more concise functioncc @siju-samuel \r\n- [x] Rename TypeParam->TypeVar as suggested by @joshpoll

Relay nodes no longer segfaults, but numerous issues came up when trying to write even these simple tests. I am curious for input about the best ways to address some of them, as some are not obvious.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it would be nice if round-trip serialization preserved alpha-equality, as one would expect it to. However, that is not the case, as there are numerous places where we check structural equality by pointer equality, as with vars and attrs. How should that be addressed?\r\n\r\nPerhaps serialization tests should be separate from the IR node tests, so we could try many different cases
