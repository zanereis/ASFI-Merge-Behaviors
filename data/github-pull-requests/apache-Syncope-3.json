This should make the process clearer, and generally prevent an invalid attribute name being coerced\nunexpectedly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2143\">2143</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed previously deprecated internal classes and methods. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2094\">2094</a></li>\n<li>Build change: the built jar's OSGi manifest no longer imports itself. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2158\">2158</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When tracking source positions, if the first node was a TextNode, its position was incorrectly set\nto <code>-1.</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2106\">2106</a></li>\n<li>When connecting (or redirecting) to URLs with characters such as <code>{</code>, <code>}</code> in the path, a Malformed URL exception would\nbe thrown (if in development), or the URL might otherwise not be escaped correctly (if in\nproduction). The URL encoding process has been improved to handle these characters\ncorrectly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2142\">2142</a></li>\n<li>When using <code>W3CDom</code> with a custom output Document, a Null Pointer Exception would be\nthrown. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2114\">2114</a></li>\n<li>The <code>:has()</code> selector did not match correctly when using sibling combinators (like\ne.g.: <code>h1:has(+h2)</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2137\">2137</a></li>\n<li>The <code>:empty</code> selector incorrectly matched elements that started with a blank text node and were followed by\nnon-empty nodes, due to an incorrect short-circuit. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2130\">2130</a></li>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail with &quot;Did not find balanced marker&quot; when building a selector for elements that had\na <code>(</code> or <code>[</code> in their class names. And selectors with those characters escaped would not match as\nexpected. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2146\">2146</a></li>\n<li>Updated <code>Entities.escape(string)</code> to make the escaped text suitable for both text nodes and attributes (previously was\nonly for text nodes). This does not impact the output of <code>Element.html()</code> which correctly applies a minimal escape\ndepending on if the use will be for text data or in a quoted\nattribute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1278\">1278</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[io.github.git-commit-id:git-commit-id-maven-plugin](https://github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin) from 9.0.0 to 9.0.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/releases\">io.github.git-commit-id:git-commit-id-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Version 9.0.1 is finally there and includes various <a href=\"https://github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues?q=milestone%3A9.0.1&amp;closed=1\">bug-fixes and improvements</a> :-)</p>\n<h2>New Features / Bug-Fixes:</h2>\n<p>The main key-aspects that have been improved or being worked on are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues/754\">#754</a> / <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues/760\">#760</a>: Fix an issue where empty git.properties had been generated in submodules when <code>injectAllReactorProjects=true</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bump several maven plugins</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bump <code>org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin </code> from <code>3.3.1</code> to <code>3.4.0</code></li>\n<li>bump <code>org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-release-plugin</code> from <code>3.0.1</code> to <code>3.1.0</code></li>\n<li>bump <code>org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin</code> from <code>3.2.5</code> to <code>3.3.0</code></li>\n<li>bump <code>org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin</code> from <code>3.3.2</code> to <code>3.4.0</code></li>\n<li>bump <code>org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin</code> from <code>3.6.1</code> to <code>3.7.1</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Getting the latest release</h2>\n<p>The plugin is available from Maven Central (<a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.github.git-commit-id%20AND%20a:git-commit-id-maven-plugin\">see here</a>), so you don't have to configure any additional repositories to use this plugin. All you need to do is to configure it inside your project as dependency:</p>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;io.github.git-commit-id&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;git-commit-id-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;9.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Getting the latest snapshot (build automatically)</h2>\n<p>If you can't wait for the next release, you can also get the latest snapshot version from sonatype, that is being deployed automatically by github actions:</p>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;pluginRepositories&gt;\n    &lt;pluginRepository&gt;\n        &lt;id&gt;sonatype-snapshots&lt;/id&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;Sonatype Snapshots&lt;/name&gt;\n         &lt;url&gt;https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/&lt;/url&gt;\n    &lt;/pluginRepository&gt;\n&lt;/pluginRepositories&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Even though the github actions will only deploy a new snapshot once all tests have finished, it is recommended to rely on the released and more stable version.</p>\n<h2>Known Issues / Limitations:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin is unfortunately not working with Heroku which is due to the fact how Heroku works. In summary Heroku does not copy over the .git-repository but in order to determine the git properties this plugin relies on the fact that it has access to the git-repository. A somewhat <em>workaround</em> to get some information is outlined in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin/issues/279#issuecomment-301284022\">ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin#279</a></li>\n<li>Using maven's plugin prefix resolution (e.g. <code>mvn com.test.plugins:myPlugin:myMojo</code>) might result in unresolved properties even with <code>&lt;injectAllReactorProjects&gt;true&lt;/injectAllReactorProjects&gt;</code>.
