directly. This may address <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6657\">&quot;Could not find <code>some-dependency</code>&quot; errors</a> that some users have reported (which might be a result of users' excluding <code>guava-parent</code>). (c6d35cf1a5)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Changed <code>Multisets.unmodifiableMultiset(set).removeIf(predicate)</code> to throw an exception always, even if nothing matches <code>predicate</code>. (61dbccfda3)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Fixed the behavior of <code>Graph</code>/<code>ValueGraph</code> views for a node when that node is removed from the graph. (950799691c)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Fixed <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> under <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6634\">Windows <em>services</em>, a rare use case</a>. (The fix actually covers only Java 9+ because Java 8 would require an additional approach. Let us know if you need support under Java 8.) (f87f68cd3e)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Made <code>MediaType.parse</code> allow and skip over whitespace around the <code>/</code> and <code>=</code> separator tokens in addition to the <code>;</code> separator, for which it was already being allowed. (2786f83291)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Tweaked <code>Futures.getChecked</code> constructor-selection behavior: The method continues to prefer to call constructors with a <code>String</code> parameter, but now it breaks ties based on whether the constructor has a <code>Throwable</code> parameter. Beyond that, the choice of constructor remains undefined. (For this and other reasons, we discourage the use of <code>getChecked</code>.)

directly. This may address <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6657\">&quot;Could not find <code>some-dependency</code>&quot; errors</a> that some users have reported (which might be a result of users' excluding <code>guava-parent</code>). (c6d35cf1a5)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Changed <code>Multisets.unmodifiableMultiset(set).removeIf(predicate)</code> to throw an exception always, even if nothing matches <code>predicate</code>. (61dbccfda3)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Fixed the behavior of <code>Graph</code>/<code>ValueGraph</code> views for a node when that node is removed from the graph. (950799691c)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Fixed <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> under <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6634\">Windows <em>services</em>, a rare use case</a>. (The fix actually covers only Java 9+ because Java 8 would require an additional approach. Let us know if you need support under Java 8.) (f87f68cd3e)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Made <code>MediaType.parse</code> allow and skip over whitespace around the <code>/</code> and <code>=</code> separator tokens in addition to the <code>;</code> separator, for which it was already being allowed. (2786f83291)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Tweaked <code>Futures.getChecked</code> constructor-selection behavior: The method continues to prefer to call constructors with a <code>String</code> parameter, but now it breaks ties based on whether the constructor has a <code>Throwable</code> parameter. Beyond that, the choice of constructor remains undefined. (For this and other reasons, we discourage the use of <code>getChecked</code>.)
