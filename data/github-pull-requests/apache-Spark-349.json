What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDue to a limitation of hive metastore(table location must be directory path, not file path), we always store `path` for data source table in storage properties, instead of the `locationUri` field. However, we should not expose this difference to `CatalogTable` level, but just treat it as a hack in `HiveExternalCatalog`, like we store table schema of data source table in table properties.\n\nThis PR unifies `path` and `locationUri` outside of `HiveExternalCatalog`, both data source table and hive serde table should use the `locationUri` field.\n\nThis PR also unifies the way we handle default table location for managed table. Previously, the default table location of hive serde managed table is set by external catalog, but the one of data source table is set by command. After this PR, we follow the hive way and the default table location is always set by external catalog.\n\nFor managed non-file-based tables, we will assign a default table location and create an empty directory for it, the table location will be removed when the table is dropped. This is reasonable as metastore doesn't care about whether a table is file-based or not, and an empty table directory has no harm.\nFor external non-file-based tables, ideally we can omit the table location, but due to a hive metastore issue, we will assign a random location to it, and remove it right after the table is created. See SPARK-15269 for more details. This is fine as it's well isolated in `HiveExternalCatalog`.\n\nTo keep the existing behaviour of the `path` option, in this PR we always add the `locationUri` to storage properties using key `path`, before passing storage properties to `DataSource` as data source options.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-09T13:20:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T01:07:36Z","closed_at":"2016-11-03T01:07:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91de6352a0b6a00854a82e2b63c32ebf77996d6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1bcb495307b72b831e2b1aff540d6000019b973","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:path","ref":"path","sha":"d1bcb495307b72b831e2b1aff540d6000019b973","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

is a backport of #14270. Because the spark.internal.config system\ndoes not exists in branch 1.6, a simpler substitution scheme for ${} in\nthe spark.metrics.namespace value, using only Spark configuration had to\nbe added to preserve the behaviour discussed in the tickets and tested.\n\nThis backport is contributed by Criteo SA under the Apache v2 licence.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdding a new property to SparkConf called spark.metrics.namespace that allows users to\nset a custom namespace for executor and driver metrics in the metrics systems.\n\nBy default, the root namespace used for driver or executor metrics is\nthe value of `spark.app.id`. However, often times, users want to be able to track the metrics\nacross apps for driver and executor metrics, which is hard to do with application ID\n(i.e. `spark.app.id`) since it changes with every invocation of the app. For such use cases,\nusers can set the `spark.metrics.namespace` property to any given value\nor to another spark configuration key reference like `${spark.app.name}`\nwhich is then used to populate the root namespace of the metrics system\n(with the app name in our example). `spark.metrics.namespace` property can be set to any\narbitrary spark property key, whose value would be used to set the root namespace of the\nmetrics system. Non driver and executor metrics are never prefixed with `spark.app.id`, nor\ndoes the `spark.metrics.namespace` property have any such affect on such metrics.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new unit tests, modified existing unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-09T11:51:42Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T15:06:25Z","closed_at":"2016-09-23T08:44:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"08650ac178d99a8b1f5363351a2b66f329c7eebb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c1c57fbb8593346410995578668cc7bff79f77e0","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:backport-SPARK-5847","ref":"backport-SPARK-5847","sha":"c1c57fbb8593346410995578668cc7bff79f77e0","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen not using spark-submit, user configuration for the JVM is ignored when creating the SparkContext.  This is because the JVM is started before the SparkConf object is initialized.  This change allows user to specify --conf args on the command line that will be used when launching the java gateway to configure the JVM.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nStarted a plain Python shell with this command and verified the JVM was configured with the correct amount of memory. \n\n```\nSPARK_HOME=$PWD PYTHONPATH=python:python/lib/py4j-0.10.3-src.zip python - --conf spark.driver.memory=4g\n```\n\nNote, the additional '-' is needed for the cmd line args to not be processed when invoking the interpreter.\n","created_at":"2016-09-09T00:10:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T01:01:35Z","closed_at":"2016-09-09T00:25:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d52ab9b6ac5c03339f716728befb12bc461dac04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/100e442983bd5f546a8dad149543a26be90ee622","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:python-gateway-conf-SPARK-17387","ref":"python-gateway-conf-SPARK-17387","sha":"100e442983bd5f546a8dad149543a26be90ee622","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNew implementation of the Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm (PAVA) in mllib.IsotonicRegression, which used under the hood by ml.regression.IsotonicRegression. The previous implementation could have factorial complexity in the worst case. This implementation, which closely follows those in scikit-learn and the R `iso` package, runs in quadratic time in the worst case.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests in both `mllib` and `ml` passed before and after this patch. Scaling properties were tested by running the `poolAdjacentViolators` method in [scala-benchmarking-template](https://github.com/sirthias/scala-benchmarking-template) with the input generated by\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nval x = (1 to length).toArray.map(_.toDouble)\r\nval y = x.reverse.zipWithIndex.map{ case (yi, i) => if (i % 2 == 1) yi - 1.5 else yi}\r\nval w = Array.fill(length)(1d)\r\n\r\nval input: Array[(Double, Double, Double)] = (y zip x zip w) map{ case ((y, x), w) => (y, x, w)}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this patch:\r\n\r\n| Input Length | Time (us) |\r\n| --: | --: |\r\n| 100 | 1.35 |\r\n| 200 | 3.14 |\r\n| 400 | 116.10 |\r\n| 800 | 2134225.90 |\r\n\r\nAfter this patch:\r\n\r\n| Input Length | Time (us) |\r\n| --: | --: |\r\n| 100 | 1.25 |\r\n| 200 | 2.53 |\r\n| 400 | 5.86 |\r\n| 800 | 10.55 |\r\n\r\nBenchmarking was also performed with randomly-generated y values, with similar results.\r\n","created_at":"2016-09-08T22:01:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T21:23:10Z","closed_at":"2017-01-23T21:23:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e13ad7438e5b353a6ef53526613086fead87fe23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0aeca09c0ea234d8a61664f2827abd80d7850c5b","head":{"label":"neggert:SPARK-17455-isoreg-algo","ref":"SPARK-17455-isoreg-algo","sha":"0aeca09c0ea234d8a61664f2827abd80d7850c5b","user":{"login":"neggert","id":1271014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzEwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1271014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert","html_url":"https://github.com/neggert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62832461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjgzMjQ2MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"neggert/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"neggert","id":1271014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzEwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1271014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert","html_url":"https://github.com/neggert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neggert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/neggert/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds methods for extracting major and minor versions as Int types in Scala from a Spark version string.\n\nMotivation: There are many hacks within Spark's codebase to identify and compare Spark versions. We should add a simple utility to standardize these code paths, especially since there have been mistakes made in the past. This will let us add unit tests as well.  Currently, I want this functionality to check Spark versions to provide backwards compatibility for ML model persistence.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests\n","created_at":"2016-09-08T21:15:39Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T17:49:26Z","closed_at":"2016-09-09T12:37:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4e793ec000c747f2abc97cce58fba518216f6d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8978cb33f35b0b2a544c29eb19e8b740637e83d8","head":{"label":"jkbradley:version-parsing","ref":"version-parsing","sha":"8978cb33f35b0b2a544c29eb19e8b740637e83d8","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore this change, we would always allocate 64MB per aggregation task for the first-level hash map storage, even when running in low-memory situations such as local mode. This changes it to use the memory manager default page size, which is automatically reduced from 64MB in these situations.\n\ncc @ooq @JoshRosen \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually with `bin/spark-shell --master=local[32]` and verifying that `(1 to math.pow(10, 3).toInt).toDF(\"n\").withColumn(\"m\", 'n % 2).groupBy('m).agg(sum('n)).show` does not

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17451\n\n`CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` in some failure cases exits the JVM. While this does not have any issue, from the driver UI there is no specific reason captured for this. In this PR, I am adding functionality to `exitExecutor` to notify driver that the executor is exiting.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan the change over a test env and took down shuffle service before the executor could register to it. In the driver logs, where the job failure reason is mentioned (ie. `Job aborted due to stage ...` it gives the correct reason:\n\nBefore:\n`ExecutorLostFailure (executor ZZZZZZZZZ exited caused by one of the running tasks) Reason: Remote RPC client disassociated. Likely due to containers exceeding thresholds, or network issues. Check driver logs for WARN messages.`\n\nAfter:\n`ExecutorLostFailure (executor ZZZZZZZZZ exited caused by one of the running tasks) Reason: Unable to create executor due to java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Timeout waiting for task.`\n","created_at":"2016-09-08T14:45:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T00:07:52Z","closed_at":"2016-09-15T17:25:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c04752cf1513465385c34449466007d7373ca1ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15013/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15013/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15013/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/71fa2e32bba298920f974c652b24983306068b09","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:SPARK-17451_inform_driver","ref":"SPARK-17451_inform_driver","sha":"71fa2e32bba298920f974c652b24983306068b09","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. `SparkLauncher` provides `stopIfInterrupted` method to allow ensuring `SparkApplication` stops if tracking process dies. \n2.  `SparkLauncher` provides `startApplicationInProcess` method to start application using reflection in another Thread instead of launching childProcess and relying on `spark-submit` binary.\n\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI ran following Manual tests:\n1. `startApplication` with request to `stopIfInterrupted`, then send interrupt signal to the process.\n  Result:  The `childprocess` kills Spark Application and terminates.\n2. `startApplicationInProcess`  with request to `stopIfInterrupted`, then send interrupt signal to the process.\n  Result:  The shutdownHook in LauncherBackend kills Spark Application and before termination.\n3. `startApplication` without `stopIfInterrupted`, then send interrupt signal to the process.\n  Result:  The `childprocess` terminates without killing the Spark Application.\n4. `startApplicationInProcess` without `stopIfInterrupted`, then send interrupt signal to the process.\n  Result:  The process terminates without killing Spark Application.\n","created_at":"2016-09-08T03:34:34Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T00:33:10Z","closed_at":"2017-09-27T00:33:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"604099bae7b9cdad74a809b18e2ea0e9bf98995d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15009/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15009/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15009/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/10513ec4a1cee2de26104945dc2eae54efeed9d2","head":{"label":"kishorvpatil:SPARK-17443","ref":"SPARK-17443","sha":"10513ec4a1cee2de26104945dc2eae54efeed9d2","user":{"login":"kishorvpatil","id":6090397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTAzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6090397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil","html_url":"https://github.com/kishorvpatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59697532,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTY5NzUzMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"kishorvpatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kishorvpatil","id":6090397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTAzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6090397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil","html_url":"https://github.com/kishorvpatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kishorvpatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe Antlr lexer we use to tokenize a SQL string may wrongly tokenize a fully qualified identifier as a decimal number token. For example, table identifier `default.123_table` is wrongly tokenized as\n\n```\ndefault // Matches lexer rule IDENTIFIER\n.123 // Matches lexer rule DECIMAL_VALUE\n_TABLE // Matches lexer rule IDENTIFIER\n```\n\nThe correct tokenization for `default.123_table` should be:\n\n```\ndefault // Matches lexer rule IDENTIFIER, \n. // Matches a single dot\n123_TABLE // Matches lexer rule IDENTIFIER\n```\n\nThis PR fix the Antlr grammar so that it can tokenize fully qualified identifier correctly:\n1. Fully qualified table name can be parsed correctly. For example, `select * from database.123_suffix`.\n2. Fully qualified column name can be parsed correctly, for example `select a.123_suffix from a`.  \n### Before change\n#### Case 1: Failed to parse fully qualified column name\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"select a.123_column from a\").show\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\nextraneous input '.123' expecting {<EOF>, \n...\n, IDENTIFIER, BACKQUOTED_IDENTIFIER}(line 1, pos 8)\n== SQL ==\nselect a.123_column from a\n--------^^^\n```\n#### Case 2: Failed to parse fully qualified table name\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"select * from default.123_table\")\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\nextraneous input '.123' expecting {<EOF>, \n...\nIDENTIFIER, BACKQUOTED_IDENTIFIER}(line 1, pos 21)\n\n== SQL ==\nselect * from default.123_table\n---------------------^^^\n```\n### After Change\n#### Case 1: fully qualified column name, no ParseException thrown\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"select a.123_column from a\").show\n```\n#### Case 2: fully qualified table name, no ParseException thrown\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"select * from default.123_table\")\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor the following `ALTER TABLE` DDL, we should issue an exception when the target table is a `VIEW`:\n\n``` SQL\n ALTER TABLE viewName SET LOCATION

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe Scala version of `SparkContext` has a handy field called `uiWebUrl` that tells you which URL the SparkUI spawned by that instance lives at. This is often very useful because the value for `spark.ui.port` in the config is only a suggestion; if that port number is taken by another Spark instance on the same machine, Spark will just keep incrementing the port until it finds a free one. So, on a machine with a lot of running PySpark instances, you often have to start trying all of them one-by-one until you find your application name.\n\nScala users have a way around this with `uiWebUrl` but Java and Python users do not. This pull request fixes this in the most straightforward way possible, simply propagating this field through the `JavaSparkContext` and into pyspark through the Java gateway.\n\nPlease let me know if any additional documentation/testing is needed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests were run to make sure there were no regressions, and a binary distribution was created and tested manually for the correct value of `sc.uiWebPort` in a variety of circumstances.\n","created_at":"2016-09-07T20:11:44Z","updated_at":"2016-12-16T18:37:48Z","closed_at":"2016-09-20T09:51:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9d716308757283e7f74854b22c4b69421da2d1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb13f43f20ca35a1bbbc45c413f15ac350917ff9","head":{"label":"rubikloud:pyspark-uiweburl","ref":"pyspark-uiweburl","sha":"cb13f43f20ca35a1bbbc45c413f15ac350917ff9","user":{"login":"rubikloud","id":3832824,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4MzI4MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3832824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rubikloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67639739,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NzYzOTczOQ==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"rubikloud/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rubikloud","id":3832824,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4MzI4MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3832824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rubikloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubikloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rubikloud/spark-public","description":"Mirror

secrets leveldb isn't being moved if you run spark shuffle services without yarn nm recovery on and then turn it on.  This fixes that.  I unfortunately missed this when I ported the patch from our internal branch 2 to master branch due to the changes for the recovery path.  Note this only applies to master since it is the only place the yarn nm recovery dir is used.\n\nUnit tests ran and tested on 8 node cluster.  Fresh startup with NM recovery, fresh startup no nm recovery, switching between no nm recovery and recovery.  Also tested running applications to make sure wasn't affected by rolling

version of [PR-9457](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/9457), rebased on latest Spark master, and using mllib-local).\n\nThis implements a parallel version of personalized pagerank, which runs all propagations for a list of source vertices in parallel.\n\nI ran a few benchmarks on the full [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/) graph. When running personalized pagerank for only one source node, the existing implementation is twice as fast as the parallel one (because of the SparseVector overhead). However for 10 source nodes, the parallel implementation is four times as fast. When increasing the number of source nodes, this difference becomes even greater.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n### motivation\r\n\r\nThe various 2G limit in Spark. \r\n1. When reading the data block is stored in the disk, the following code fragment is called. \r\n   \r\n   ``` scala\r\n     val iterToReturn: Iterator[Any] = {\r\n       val diskBytes = diskStore.getBytes(blockId)\r\n       if (level.deserialized) {\r\n         val diskValues = serializerManager.dataDeserializeStream(\r\n           blockId,\r\n           diskBytes.toInputStream(dispose = true))(info.classTag)\r\n         maybeCacheDiskValuesInMemory(info, blockId, level, diskValues)\r\n       } else {\r\n         val stream = maybeCacheDiskBytesInMemory(info, blockId, level, diskBytes)\r\n           .map {_.toInputStream(dispose = false)}\r\n           .getOrElse { diskBytes.toInputStream(dispose = true) }\r\n         serializerManager.dataDeserializeStream(blockId, stream)(info.classTag)\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   ``` scala\r\n     def getBytes(blockId: BlockId): ChunkedByteBuffer = {\r\n       val file = diskManager.getFile(blockId.name)\r\n       val channel = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"r\").getChannel\r\n       Utils.tryWithSafeFinally {\r\n         // For small files, directly read rather than memory map\r\n         if (file.length < minMemoryMapBytes) {\r\n           val buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(file.length.toInt)\r\n           channel.position(0)\r\n           while (buf.remaining() != 0) {\r\n             if (channel.read(buf) == -1) {\r\n               throw new IOException(\"Reached EOF before filling buffer\\n\" +\r\n                 s\"offset=0\\nfile=${file.getAbsolutePath}\\nbuf.remaining=${buf.remaining}\")\r\n             }\r\n           }\r\n           buf.flip()\r\n           new ChunkedByteBuffer(buf)\r\n         } else {\r\n           new ChunkedByteBuffer(channel.map(MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0, file.length))\r\n         }\r\n       } {\r\n         channel.close()\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   The above code has the following problems:  \r\n   - `channel.map(MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0, file.length)` returns an instance of `MappedByteBuffer`. the size of `MappedByteBuffer` can not exceed 2G. \r\n   - When a `Iterator[Any]` is generated, need to load all the data into the memory,this may take up a lot of memory.\r\n2. When using kryo serialized data, the following code fragment is called: \r\n   \r\n   ``` scala\r\n   \r\n     override def serialize[T: ClassTag](t: T): ByteBuffer = {\r\n       output.clear()\r\n       val kryo = borrowKryo()\r\n       try {\r\n         kryo.writeClassAndObject(output, t)\r\n       } catch {\r\n         case e: KryoException if e.getMessage.startsWith(\"Buffer overflow\") =>\r\n           throw new SparkException(s\"Kryo serialization failed: ${e.getMessage}. To avoid this, \" +\r\n             \"increase spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max value.\")\r\n       } finally {\r\n         releaseKryo(kryo)\r\n       }\r\n       ByteBuffer.wrap(output.toBytes)\r\n     }\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   The above code has the following problems:\r\n   - The serialization data is stored in the `output` internal `byte[]`, the size of `byte[]` can not exceed 2G. \r\n3. When RPC writes data to be sent to the Channel, the following code fragment is called: \r\n   \r\n   ``` scala\r\n     public long transferTo(final WritableByteChannel target, final long position) throws IOException {\r\n       Preconditions.checkArgument(position == totalBytesTransferred, \"Invalid position.\");\r\n       // Bytes written for header in this call.\r\n       long writtenHeader = 0;\r\n       if (header.readableBytes() > 0) {\r\n         writtenHeader = copyByteBuf(header, target);\r\n         totalBytesTransferred += writtenHeader;\r\n         if (header.readableBytes() > 0) {\r\n           return writtenHeader;\r\n         }\r\n       }\r\n   \r\n       // Bytes written for body in this call.\r\n       long writtenBody = 0;\r\n       if (body instanceof FileRegion) {\r\n         writtenBody = ((FileRegion) body).transferTo(target, totalBytesTransferred - headerLength);\r\n       } else if (body instanceof ByteBuf) {\r\n         writtenBody = copyByteBuf((ByteBuf) body, target);\r\n       }\r\n       totalBytesTransferred += writtenBody;\r\n       return writtenHeader + writtenBody;\r\n     }\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   The above code has the following problems: \r\n   - the size of ByteBuf cannot exceed 2G \r\n   - cannot transfer data over 2G in memory\r\n4. When decodes the RPC message received, the following code fragment is called: \r\n   \r\n   ``` scala\r\n   public final class MessageDecoder extends MessageToMessageDecoder<ByteBuf> {\r\n   \r\n     private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MessageDecoder.class);\r\n   \r\n     @Override\r\n     public void decode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, ByteBuf in, List<Object> out) {\r\n       Message.Type msgType = Message.Type.decode(in);\r\n       Message decoded = decode(msgType, in);\r\n       assert decoded.type() == msgType;\r\n       logger.trace(\"Received message {}: {}\", msgType, decoded);\r\n       out.add(decoded);\r\n     }\r\n   \r\n     private Message decode(Message.Type msgType, ByteBuf in) {\r\n       switch (msgType) {\r\n         case ChunkFetchRequest:\r\n           return ChunkFetchRequest.decode(in);\r\n   \r\n         case ChunkFetchSuccess:\r\n           return ChunkFetchSuccess.decode(in);\r\n   \r\n         case ChunkFetchFailure:\r\n           return ChunkFetchFailure.decode(in);\r\n   \r\n         default:\r\n           throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unexpected message type: \" + msgType);\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   The above code has the following problems: \r\n   - the size of ByteBuf cannot exceed 2G \r\n   - Must be in the receiver to complete the data can be decoded\r\n### Goals\r\n- Setup for eliminating the various 2G limit in Spark.   (The 2G limit 1,2,3,4)\r\n- Support back-pressure flow control for remote data reading(experimental goal).  (The 2G limit 4)\r\n- Add buffer pool(long-range goal). \r\n### Design\r\n#### Setup for eliminating the various 2G limit in Spark.\r\n##### Replace ByteBuffer with ChunkedByteBuffer. (The 2G limit 1,2)\r\n- Support reference counting, a necessary condition to the feature of the buffer pool \r\n    [Reference counted objects](http://netty.io/wiki/reference-counted-objects.html)\r\n- Support serialization for easy transport \r\n- Support slice duplicate and copy operation \r\n- Can be efficiently converted to `InputStream`, `ByteBuffer`, `byte[]` and `ByteBuf`, etc. \r\n1. Move the ChunkedByteBuffer class to `common/network-common/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/buffer/`. \r\n2. Modify `ManagedBuffer.nioByteBuffer`'s return value to ChunkedByteBuffer instance.(The 2G limit 1)\r\n3. Modify the parameter of `SerializerInstance.deserialize` and the return value of `SerializerInstance.serialize` to ChunkedByteBuffer instance. (The 2G limit 2)\r\n   \r\n   ``` scala\r\n   def serialize[T: ClassTag](t: T): ChunkedByteBuffer = {\r\n     output.clear()\r\n     val out = ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream.newInstance()\r\n     output.setOutputStream(out)\r\n     val kryo = borrowKryo()\r\n     kryo.writeClassAndObject(output, t)\r\n     output.close()\r\n     out.toChunkedByteBuffer\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n4. Other changes. \r\n##### Replace ByteBuf with InputStream.\r\n1. Modify `NioManagedBuffer.convertToNetty` method returns InputStream instances when data is larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE. (The 2G limit 3)\r\n2. Add InputStreamManagedBuffer class, used to convert InputStream instance to ManagedBuffer instance. (The 2G limit 4)\r\n3. Modify MessageWithHeader classes, support processing InputStream instance (The 2G limit 3)\r\n4. Modify the parameters of the `Encodable.encode` method to OutputStream instance. (The 2G limit 4)\r\n5. Modify the parameters of the decode method of the classes who implement the Encodable interface to InputStream instance.It can handle mixed storage data  (The 2G limit 3) \r\n   \r\n   ``` scala\r\n   public InputStream toInputStream() throws IOException {\r\n     ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream out = ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream.newInstance();\r\n     Encoders.Bytes.encode(out, type().id());\r\n     encodeWithoutBlockData(out);\r\n     // out.toChunkedByteBuffer().toInputStream() data in memory\r\n     // blockData.createInputStream()  data in hard disk(FileInputStream)\r\n     return new SequenceInputStream(out.toChunkedByteBuffer().toInputStream(),\r\n         blockData.createInputStream());\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n6. Modify TransportFrameDecoder class, use `LinkedList<ByteBuf>` to represent the Frame, remove the size limit of Frame.  The 2G limit 4) \r\n7. Add ByteBufInputStream class, used to convert `LinkedList<ByteBuf>` instance to InputStream instance.  (The 2G limit 4) \r\n8. Modify the parameters of `RpcHandler.receive` method to InputStream instance.  (The 2G limit 4) \r\n#### Read data\r\n##### Local data\r\n1. Only the data stored in the memory is represented by ChunkedByteBuffer, the other is represented by ManagedBuffer.  (The 2G limit 1) \r\n   - Modify `DiskStore.getBytes`'s return value type to  ManagedBuffer instance,  which calls `ManagedBuffer.nioByteBuffer` only when the memory has enough space to store the ManagedBuffer data.\r\n##### Remote Data (The 2G limit 4)\r\n\r\nThere are three options: \r\n1. Add InputStreamInterceptor to support propagate back-pressure to shuffle server(The option has been implemented): \r\n   - When the number of ByteBuf in the cache exceeds a certain amount, call `channel.config ().SetAutoRead (false)` disable AUTO_READ, no longer automatically call `channle.read ()`. \r\n   - When the number of ByteBuf in the cache is smaller than a certain amount, call `channel.config().setAutoRead(true)` enable AUTO_READ . \r\n   - The advantage of this option is to support propagate back-pressure; drawback is that can lead semantic change the existing API, in some cases the IO retry function is invalid. \r\n2.  When the size of message is greater than a certain value, the message is written to disk, not take up memory. ma\r\n   - The advantage of this options is to take up very little memory, the disadvantage is to increase the disk IO. \r\n3. Combined with buffer pool, qs far as possible stores data in memory. \r\n   - Write message to the buffer pool when there has enough memory, otherwise write on disk. \r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n#13584 resolved the issue of features and label columns conflict with `RFormula` default ones when loading libsvm data, but it still left some issues should be resolved:\n\n1, It’s not necessary to check and rename label column.\nSince we have considerations on the design of `RFormula`, it can handle the case of label column already exists(with restriction of the existing label column should be numeric/boolean type). So it’s not necessary to change the column name to avoid conflict. If the label column is not numeric/boolean type, `RFormula` will throw exception.\n\n2, We should rename features column name to new one if there is conflict, but appending a random value is enough since it was used internally only. We done similar work when implementing `SQLTransformer`.\n\n3, We should set correct new features column for the estimators. Take `GLM` as example:\n`GLM` estimator should set features column with the changed one(rFormula.getFeaturesCol) rather than the default “features”. Although it’s same when training model, but it involves problems when predicting. The following is the prediction result of GLM before this PR:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1962026/18308227/84c3c452-74a8-11e6-9caa-9d6d846cc957.png)\nWe should drop the internal used feature column name, otherwise, it will appear on the prediction DataFrame which will confused users. And this behavior is same as other scenarios which does not exist column name conflict.\nAfter this PR:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1962026/18308240/92082a04-74a8-11e6-9226-801f52b856d9.png)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is a follow up of SPARK-17356. Current implementation of `TreeNode.toJSON` recursively converts all fields of TreeNode to JSON, even if the field is of type `Seq` or type Map. This may trigger out of memory exception in cases like:\n1. the Seq or Map can be very big. Converting them to JSON may take huge memory, which may trigger out of memory error.\n2. Some user space input may also be propagated to the Plan. The user space input can be of arbitrary type, and may also be self-referencing. Trying to print user space input to JSON may trigger out of memory error or stack overflow error.\n\nFor a code example, please check the Jira description of SPARK-17426.\n\nIn this PR, we refactor the `TreeNode.toJSON` so that we only convert a field to JSON string if the field is a safe type.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test.\n","created_at":"2016-09-07T05:01:02Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T11:39:44Z","closed_at":"2016-09-16T11:39:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d7119ef8bb2120b4cf35433c7e3aa78769bf914","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/145175393f9d6526429cdada0a1db78ca8fe2998","head":{"label":"clockfly:json_oom2","ref":"json_oom2","sha":"145175393f9d6526429cdada0a1db78ca8fe2998","user":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57937220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzkzNzIyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"clockfly/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we create a filestream on a directory that has partitioned subdirs (i.e. dir/x=y/), then ListingFileCatalog.allFiles returns the files in the dir as Seq[String] which internally is a Stream[String]. This is because of this [line](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/PartitioningAwareFileCatalog.scala#L93), where a LinkedHashSet.values.toSeq returns Stream. Then when the [FileStreamSource](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/FileStreamSource.scala#L79) filters this Stream[String] to remove the seen files, it creates a new Stream[String], which has a filter function that has a $outer reference to the FileStreamSource (in Scala 2.10). Trying to serialize this Stream[String] causes NotSerializableException. This will happened even if there is just one file in the dir.\n\nIts important to note that this behavior is different in Scala 2.11. There is no $outer reference to FileStreamSource, so it does not throw NotSerializableException. However, with a large sequence of files (tested with 10000 files), it throws StackOverflowError. This is because how Stream class is implemented. Its basically like a linked list, and attempting to serialize a long Stream requires _recursively_ going through linked list, thus resulting in StackOverflowError.\n\nIn short, across both Scala 2.10 and 2.11, serialization fails when both the following conditions are true.\n- file stream defined on a partitioned directory\n- directory has 10k+ files\n\nThe right solution is to convert the seq to an array before writing to the log. This PR implements this fix in two ways.\n- Changing all uses for HDFSMetadataLog to ensure Array is used instead of Seq\n- Added a `require` in HDFSMetadataLog such that it is never used with type Seq\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit test that test that ensures the file stream source can handle with 10000 files. This tests fails in both Scala 2.10 and 2.11 with different failures as indicated above.\n","created_at":"2016-09-07T00:27:15Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T02:36:21Z","closed_at":"2016-09-07T02:36:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8528d06e8a7d8b9c77f7281d55475368491fa67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14987/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14987/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14987/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9bcbb087d2935657a30eb9bc6b52ea6fbed65edf","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-17372","ref":"SPARK-17372","sha":"9bcbb087d2935657a30eb9bc6b52ea6fbed65edf","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nModifies the `build/mvn` and `build/sbt-launch-lib.bash` scripts so that they check the Java version and omit the `-XX:MaxPermSize=512M` option for Java versions >= 8.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan the build on Linux and Mac with Java 7 and 8, from `build/mvn` and `dev/run-tests`. Also tested Java 8 with `JAVA_7_HOME` pointing to a Java 7 installation.\n\nCurrently, `dev/run-tests` has a few remaining instances of the MaxPermSize warning, apparently due to another code path to spawning a JVM. Keeping this PR as a WIP until the output of `dev/run-tests` is completely clean.\n","created_at":"2016-09-06T23:27:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T22:44:58Z","closed_at":"2016-09-07T22:44:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27fb584fc69d5cd68be47dda88fb35c3e22357e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14986/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14986/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14986/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8561a14649c11503831118f7b9c68e4acbb6fc1","head":{"label":"frreiss:fred-17421","ref":"fred-17421","sha":"e8561a14649c11503831118f7b9c68e4acbb6fc1","user":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61155195,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTE1NTE5NQ==","name":"spark-fred","full_name":"frreiss/spark-fred","private":false,"owner":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss/spark-fred","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n### Design\n#### Setup for eliminating the various 2G limit in Spark.\n##### Replace ByteBuffer with ChunkedByteBuffer.\n1. Move the ChunkedByteBuffer class to `common/network-common/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/buffer/`\n2. Modify `ManagedBuffer.nioByteBuffer`'s return value to ChunkedByteBuffer instance.\n3. Modify the parameter of `SerializerInstance.deserialize` and the return value of `SerializerInstance.serialize` ChunkedByteBuffer instance.\n4. Other changes.\n##### Replace ByteBuf with InputStream.\n1. Add InputStreamManagedBuffer class, used to convert InputStream instance to ManagedBuffer instance.\n2. Modify `NioManagedBuffer.convertToNetty` method returns InputStream instances when data is larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE. \n3. Modify the parameters of the `Encodable.encode` method to OutputStream instance. \n4. Modify the parameters of the decode method of the classes who implement the Encodable interface to InputStream instance.\n5. Modify TransportFrameDecoder class, use `LinkedList<ByteBuf>` to represent the Frame, remove the size limit of Frame.\n6. Add ByteBufInputStream class, used to convert `LinkedList<ByteBuf>` instance to InputStream instance.  \n7. Modify the parameters of `RpcHandler.receive` method to InputStream instance.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTODO

is a backport of PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14915 to branch 1.6.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nclass `org.apache.spark.sql.types.Metadata` is widely used in mllib to store some ml attributes. `Metadata` is commonly stored in `Alias` expression. \n\n```\ncase class Alias(child: Expression, name: String)(\n    val exprId: ExprId = NamedExpression.newExprId,\n    val qualifier: Option[String] = None,\n    val explicitMetadata: Option[Metadata] = None,\n    override val isGenerated: java.lang.Boolean = false)\n```\n\nThe `Metadata` can take a big memory footprint since the number of attributes is big ( in scale of million). When `toJSON` is called on `Alias` expression, the `Metadata` will also be converted to a big JSON string. \nIf a plan contains many such kind of `Alias` expressions, it may trigger out of memory error when `toJSON` is called, since converting all `Metadata` references to JSON will take huge memory.\n\nWith this PR, we will skip scanning Metadata when doing JSON conversion. For a reproducer of the OOM, and analysis, please look at jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17356. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-06T10:12:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T00:03:38Z","closed_at":"2016-09-07T00:03:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05733bfaf0ce16eb1c2ac44bba9adc1f60102995","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b0b4b9e4f0756f2940d58e934a4e06c176146306","head":{"label":"clockfly:json_oom_1.6","ref":"json_oom_1.6","sha":"b0b4b9e4f0756f2940d58e934a4e06c176146306","user":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57937220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzkzNzIyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"clockfly/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter we adding a new field `stats` into `CatalogTable`, we should not expose Hive-specific Stats metadata to `MetastoreRelation`. It complicates all the related codes. It also introduces a bug in `SHOW CREATE TABLE`. The statistics-related table properties should be skipped by `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, since it could be incorrect in the newly created table. See the Hive JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13792\r\n\r\nAlso fix the issue to fill Hive-generated RowCounts to our stats. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to handle Hive-specific Stats metadata

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`DataSourceStrategy` does not consider `SQLConf` in `Context` and always match column names. For instance, `HiveContext` uses case insensitive configuration, but it's ignored in `DataSourceStrategy`. This issue was originally registered at SPARK-11301 against 1.6.0 and seemed to be fixed at that time, but Apache Spark 1.6.2 still handles **partitioned column name** in a case-sensitive way always. This is incorrect like the following.\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE t(a int) PARTITIONED BY (b string) STORED AS PARQUET\")\nscala> sql(\"INSERT INTO TABLE t PARTITION(b='P') SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1) t\")\nscala> sql(\"INSERT INTO TABLE t PARTITION(b='Q') SELECT * FROM (SELECT 2) t\")\nscala> sql(\"SELECT * FROM T WHERE B='P'\").show\n+---+---+\n|  a|  b|\n+---+---+\n|  1|  P|\n|  2|  Q|\n+---+---+\n```\n\nThe result is the same with `set spark.sql.caseSensitive=false`. Here is the result in [Databricks CE](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/6660119172909095/3421754458488607/5162191866050912/latest.html) .\n\nThis PR reads the configuration and handle the column name comparison accordingly.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins test with a modified

a virtualenv for isolation and easy installation of `pep8` and `pylint` by the `lint-python` linter script.\n\nThis involves 2 changes in this script:\n- it creates a virtualenv if we are not in one. This way, we can use pip to install development environment's dependencies (which are different from the \"prod\" environment, for instance we don't want to install pep or pylint on prod)\n- dependencies are described in `requirements.txt`. This will \"freeze\" the version of the tools used. We don't want the HEAD starting breaking because a new version of pylint has been posted on pypi which add new checks. sphinx version is also \"frozen\".\n\nThis basically reverts 85a50a6352b72c4619d010e29e3a76774dbc0c71\n\nMight have been a solution to SPARK-9385 (see #7704)\n\nLot of new tests introduced by the newer version of pylint have been disabled. I propose to fix issues in various pull requests (obviously most 'import' order errors should be fixed by my other pull requests such as #14830 for documentation examples, which is part of the effort on code style described in #14567). Each subsequent pull request will fix one or more error and reenable the according pylint check.\n\nList of new disabled tests:\n- bad-super-call\n- consider-iterating-dictionary\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `SessionCatalog`, we have several operations(`getTableMetadata`, `tableExists`, `renameTable`, `dropTable`, `loopupRelation`) that handle both temp views and metastore tables/views. They can save some lines of code for some commands that need to deal with both temp views and metastore tables/views, but also introduce bugs for other commands, because the operation names say nothing about temp views and are very likely to be misused:\n- `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`/`CREATE TABLE USING` will fail if a same-name temp view exits\n- `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable` with overwrite mode will mistakenly drop a same-name temp view.\n- `Catalog.dropTempView` may drop metastore table mistakenly\n- `ALTER TABLE RECOVER PARTITIONS`/`LOAD DATA`/`TRUNCATE TABLE`/`SHOW CREATE TABLE` should report \"table not found\" instead of \"temp view is not supported\", if a same-name temp view exists, because these commands don't need to deal with temp views.\n\nIn some commands we support temp views mistakenly without mentioning it in document: `ShowTablePropertiesCommand`, `ShowColumnsCommand`, `Catalog.listColumns`.\nThis PR remove the temp view support in `ShowTablePropertiesCommand`, as temp view doesn't have properties. And explicitly document that `ShowColumnsCommand` and `Catalog.listColumns` support temp view.\n\nMixing the handling of temp views and metastore tables/views also makes it harder to implement thread-safe operations. e.g. `AlterViewAsCommand` checks `isTemporaryTable` first then `createTempView`, which is not atomic. Most temp view related operations in `SessionCatalog` hold a lock on the `SessionCatalog` object, which is unnecessary.\n\nThis PR separates the management of temp views and metastore tables/views in `SessionCatalog`, any commands that need to deal with temp views should explicitly call temp view related operations in `SessionCatalog`, to fix existing bugs and prevent future bug like this.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests and 3 new tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-05T14:04:07Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T12:33:26Z","closed_at":"2016-10-18T13:12:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e3de4ab804a91b663f08108cf7abce93361e8d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f42135586cdb9b71d44b9294a7f0d502a1da56ff","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:temp-view","ref":"temp-view","sha":"f42135586cdb9b71d44b9294a7f0d502a1da56ff","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe root cause that we would ignore SparkConf when launching JVM is that SparkConf require JVM to be created first.  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/conf.py#L106\nIn this PR, I would defer the launching of JVM until SparkContext is created so that we can pass SparkConf to JVM correctly.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nLike the description in  [SPARK-4502](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4502), we have the same problem in Baidu and our user's parquet file has complex nested parquet struct(400+ fields and 4 layer nested) so this problem brings unnecessary data read and time spend. This pr fixed the problem and main fix ideas list as follows:\n1.  Add booleanConf `spark.sql.parquet.nestColumnPruning`, when it’s closed, same logical with before\n2.  In `FileSourceStrategy`, traverse `projects[NamedExpression]` and generate the access path of nested struct.\n   For example:  in query `select people.addr.city from table`\n   project getStructField('city', getStructField('addr', AttributeRefence('people'))) will have the access path ['people', 'addr', 'city']\n3. get StructField recursively by the access path\n4. Merge structType of fields in same structType and merge filter attributes\n   For example:  the json format of struct type \n\n```\nroot\n    |-- people: struct (nullable = true)\n    |-- addr: struct (nullable = true)\n    |    |-- city: string (nullable = true)\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nroot\n    |-- people: struct (nullable = true)\n    |-- addr: struct (nullable = true)\n    |    |-- zip_code: string (nullable = true)\n```\n\nwill merge to \n\n```\nroot\n    |-- people: struct (nullable = true)\n    |-- addr: struct (nullable = true)\n    |    |-- city: string (nullable = true)\n    |    |-- zip_code: string (nullable = true)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadd new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt's really weird that we allow users to specify database in both from table name and to table name\n in `ALTER TABLE RENAME TO`, while logically we can't support rename a table to a different database.\n\nBoth postgres and MySQL disallow this syntax, it's reasonable to follow them and simply our code.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we trying to read a table and then write to the same table using the `Overwrite` save mode, we got a very confusing error message:\nFor

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes a `java.io.StreamCorruptedException` error affecting remote reads of cached values when certain data types are used. The problem stems from #11801 / SPARK-13990, a patch to have Spark automatically pick the \"best\" serializer when caching RDDs. If PySpark cached a PythonRDD, then this would be cached as an `RDD[Array[Byte]]` and the automatic serializer selection would pick KryoSerializer for replication and block transfer. However, the `getRemoteValues()` / `getRemoteBytes()` code path did not pass proper class tags in order to enable the same serializer to be used during deserialization, causing Java to be inappropriately used instead of Kryo, leading to the StreamCorruptedException.\n\nWe already fixed a similar bug in #14311, which dealt with similar issues in block replication. Prior to that patch, it seems that we had no tests to ensure that block replication actually succeeded. Similarly, prior to this bug fix patch it looks like we had no tests to perform remote reads of cached data, which is why this bug was able to remain latent for so long.\n\nThis patch addresses the bug by modifying `BlockManager`'s `get()` and  `getRemoteValues()` methods to accept ClassTags, allowing the proper class tag to be threaded in the `getOrElseUpdate` code path (which is used by

propose a more reasonable (?) and deterministic result in this and other corner cases.\n\nRevise semantics of ProbabilisticClassifierModel thresholds so that classes can only be predicted if they exceed their threshold (meaning no class may be predicted), and otherwise ordering by highest probability, then lowest threshold, then by class index.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting and

Also, it seems `DateType` and `TimestampType` could be inferred.\n\nAs far as I know, it is pretty common to use both for a partition column.\n\nThis PR fixes the incorrect `DecimalType` try and also

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14531.\n\nThe existing `CREATE TABLE LIKE` command has multiple issues:\n- The generated table is non-empty when the source table is a data source table. The major reason is the data source table is using the table property `path` to store the location of table contents. Currently, we keep it unchanged. Thus, we still create the same table with the same location.\n- The table type of the generated table is `EXTERNAL` when the source table is an external Hive Serde table. Currently, we explicitly set it to `MANAGED`, but Hive is checking the table property `EXTERNAL` to decide whether the table is `EXTERNAL` or not. (See https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java#L1407-L1408) Thus, the created table is still `EXTERNAL`. \n- When the source table is a `VIEW`, the metadata of the generated table contains the original view text and view original text. So far, this does not break anything, but it could cause something wrong in Hive. (For example, https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java#L1405-L1406)\n- The issue regarding the table `comment`. To follow what Hive does, the table comment should be cleaned, but the column comments should be still kept.\n- The `INDEX` table is not supported. Thus, we should throw an exception in this case. \n- `owner` should not be retained. `ToHiveTable` set it [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e679bc3c1cd418ef0025d2ecbc547c9660cac433/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L793) no matter which value we set in `CatalogTable`. We set it to an empty string for avoiding the confusing output in Explain.\n- Add a support for temp tables\n- Like Hive, we should not copy the table properties from the source table to the created table, especially for the statistics-related properties, which could be wrong in the created table.\n- `unsupportedFeatures` should not be copied from the source table. The created table does not have these unsupported features.\n- When the type of source table is a view, the target table is using the default format of data source tables: `spark.sql.sources.default`.\n\nThis PR is to fix the above issues. \n### How was this patch tested?\n\nImprove the test coverage by adding more test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request implements the most expedient change to fix SPARK-17386: Use a default trigger interval of 100ms instead of polling continuously for new data by default. I've changed the default value used in both `StreamingQueryManager` and `StreamTest` and created a new constant to facilitate changing both of those defaults simultaneously in the future.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAll existing regression tests pass, and most of those tests use the default trigger intervals that this PR changes.\n","created_at":"2016-09-03T00:00:35Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T23:58:02Z","closed_at":"2016-09-07T23:58:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43f489e98491705a9013740d5ebc06c5f15b6d33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14945/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14945/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14945/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b1e7fd55adaa7faf5344ea5ddc135cf9cbaf3507","head":{"label":"frreiss:fred-17386","ref":"fred-17386","sha":"b1e7fd55adaa7faf5344ea5ddc135cf9cbaf3507","user":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61155195,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTE1NTE5NQ==","name":"spark-fred","full_name":"frreiss/spark-fred","private":false,"owner":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss/spark-fred","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBackports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14941 in 2.0. \n\nThis patch fixes a bug in the vectorized parquet reader that's caused by re-using the same dictionary column vector while reading consecutive row groups. Specifically, this issue manifests for a certain distribution of dictionary/plain encoded data while we read/populate the underlying bit packed dictionary data into a column-vector based data structure.\n\nManually tested on datasets provided by the community. Thanks to Chris Perluss and Keith Kraus for their invaluable help in tracking down this issue!\n\nAuthor: Sameer Agarwal sameerag@cs.berkeley.edu\n\nCloses #14941 from sameeragarwal/parquet-exception-2.\n","created_at":"2016-09-02T23:17:00Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T22:22:25Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T22:22:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69f472ae03ffcde9b99195cdeb42917f99806fcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14944/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14944/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14944/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/facf221006295f8984498de20c66da78cb0d42fa","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:branch-2.0","ref":"branch-2.0","sha":"facf221006295f8984498de20c66da78cb0d42fa","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

make the log file more readable, rework some of the logging done\nby the AM:\n- log executor command / env just once, since they're all almost the same;\n  the information that changes, such as executor ID, is already available\n  in other log messages.\n- avoid printing logs when nothing happens, especially when updating the\n  container requests in the allocator.\n- print fewer log messages when requesting many unlocalized executors,\n  instead of repeating the same message multiple times.\n- removed some logs that seemed unnecessary.\n\nIn the process, I slightly fixed up the wording in a few log messages, and\ndid some minor clean up of method arguments that were redundant.\n\nTested by running existing unit tests, and analyzing the logs of an\napplication that exercises dynamic allocation by forcing executors\nto be allocated and be killed in waves.\n","created_at":"2016-09-02T22:30:18Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T16:35:44Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T22:57:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f39af6773b77d6381888ee04815920ceb9997d47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14943/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14943/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14943/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef0c058a48fe021d347100e26f56e9835c236ac8","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-15891","ref":"SPARK-15891","sha":"ef0c058a48fe021d347100e26f56e9835c236ac8","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes a bug in the vectorized parquet reader that's caused by re-using the same dictionary column vector while reading consecutive row groups. Specifically, this issue manifests for a certain distribution of dictionary/plain encoded data while we read/populate the underlying bit packed dictionary data into a column-vector based data structure.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested on datasets provided by the community.

the labelPropagation of graphx lib, node is initialized with a unique\nlabel and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have, but ignore the label it currently have. I think it is unreasonable, because the labe a node had is also useful. When a node trend to has a stable label, this means there is an association between two iterations, so a node not only affected by its neighbors, but also its current label.\nso I change the code, and use both the label of its neighbors and itself.\n\nThis iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form\ncommunities. But the communities of the LabelPropagation often discontinuous.\nBecause when the label that most of its neighbors currents have are many,e.g, node \"0\" has 6 neigbors labed {\"1\",\"1\",\"2\",\"2\",\"3\",\"3\"},it maybe randomly select a label. in order to get a stable label of communities, and prevent the randomness, so I chose the max lable of node.\n\nyou can test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nthe `catalogString` for `ArrayType` and `MapType` currently calls the `simpleString` method on its children. This is a problem when the child is a struct, the `struct.simpleString` implementation truncates the number of fields it shows (25 at max). This breaks the generation of a proper `catalogString`, and has shown to cause errors while writing to Hive.\n\nThis PR fixes this by providing proper `catalogString` implementations for `ArrayData` or `MapData`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded testing for `catalogString` to `DataTypeSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-09-02T15:11:40Z","updated_at":"2016-09-03T17:04:24Z","closed_at":"2016-09-03T17:04:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bcc1e9c451b98abf2e4f31af9c5b83c33d884fd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14938/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14938/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14938/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b57bbb6704cd360427126da2e2e1ef2e8f758e93","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17335","ref":"SPARK-17335","sha":"b57bbb6704cd360427126da2e2e1ef2e8f758e93","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

This can happen easily if the prior map task is waiting for a network timeout when its stage is resubmitted.\n\nThis can cause unnecessary stage resubmits, sometimes multiple times as fetch fails cause a cascade of shuffle file invalidations, and confusing FetchFailure messages that report shuffle index files missing from the local disk.\n\nGiven that IndexShuffleBlockResolver commits data atomically, it seems unnecessary to ever delete committed task output: even in the rare case that a task is failed after it finishes committing shuffle output, it should be safe to retain that output.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPrior to the fix proposed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14931, I was able to reproduce this behavior by killing slaves in the middle of a large shuffle. After this patch, stages were no longer resubmitted multiple times due to shuffle index loss.\n\ncc @JoshRosen @vanzin

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDAGScheduler invalidates shuffle files when an executor loss event occurs, but not when the external shuffle service is enabled. This is because when shuffle service is on, the shuffle file lifetime can exceed the executor lifetime.\n\nHowever, it also doesn't invalidate shuffle files when the shuffle service itself is lost (due to whole slave loss). This can cause long hangs when slaves are lost since the file loss is not detected until a subsequent stage attempts to read the shuffle files.\n\nThe proposed fix is to also invalidate shuffle files when an executor is lost due to a `SlaveLost` event.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests, also verified on an actual cluster that slave loss invalidates shuffle files immediately as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds better error messages for malformed record when reading a JSON file using DataFrameReader.  \n\nFor example, for query:\n\n```\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\nval corruptRecords = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(\"\"\"{\"a\":{, b:3}\"\"\" :: Nil)\nval schema = StructType(StructField(\"a\", StringType, true) :: Nil)\nval jsonDF = spark.read.schema(schema).json(corruptRecords)\n```\n\n**Before change:**\nWe silently replace corrupted line with null\n\n```\nscala> jsonDF.show\n+----+\n|   a|\n+----+\n|null|\n+----+\n```\n\n**After change:**\nAdd an explicit warning message:\n\n```\nscala> jsonDF.show\n16/09/02 14:43:16 WARN JacksonParser: Found at least one malformed records (sample: {\"a\":{, b:3}). The JSON reader will replace\nall malformed records with placeholder null in current PERMISSIVE parser mode.\nTo find out which corrupted records have been replaced with null, please use the\ndefault inferred schema instead of providing a custom schema.\n\nCode example to print all malformed records (scala):\n===================================================\n// The corrupted record exists in column _corrupt_record.\nval parsedJson = spark.read.json(\"/path/to/json/file/test.json\")\n\n+----+\n|   a|\n+----+\n|null|\n+----+\n```\n### \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn LongToUnsafeRowMap, we use offset of a value as pointer, stored in a array also in the page for chained values. The offset is not portable, because Platform.LONG_ARRAY_OFFSET will be different with different JVM Heap size, then the deserialized LongToUnsafeRowMap will be corrupt.\n\nThis PR will change to use portable address (without Platform.LONG_ARRAY_OFFSET).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case with random generated keys, to improve the coverage. But this test is not a regression test, that could require a Spark cluster that have at least 32G heap in driver or executor.\n","created_at":"2016-09-01T20:59:09Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T21:24:18Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T17:49:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e6ad1d6d26bbf6a2185152d2938cda2521544e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/09e1c8959b45c1d9a514702fb5c4f9bd607ac955","head":{"label":"davies:longmap","ref":"longmap","sha":"09e1c8959b45c1d9a514702fb5c4f9bd607ac955","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror
