versions:\r\n\r\n```console\r\napache-airflow==2.8.3\r\napache-airflow-providers-amazon==8.19.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now I have a broken DAG:\r\n```console\r\nBroken DAG: [/opt/airflow/dags/distributor_catalogue.py]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/models/baseoperator.py\", line 265, in

region is this one:\r\n```python\r\nEcsRunTaskOperator.partial(\r\n    task_id=\"task_id\",\r\n    aws_conn_id=\"aws_manual_test\",\r\n    cluster=\"tf_ecs_airflow\",\r\n

why it is broken?\r\nThanks a lot :face_holding_back_tears: (edited) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis happen because partial check signature, and if argument not exists in any MRO references it will failed.\r\nWe grab `region` directly from kwargs and remove it, for avoid provide it into the BaseOperator.\r\n\r\nFix pretty simple, add `region` into `AwsBaseOperator` / `AwsBaseSensor` signatures, it should fix all operators which migrated to this helper operators and use deprecated `region` attribute over Dynamic Task Mapping \r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33400\r\n\r\nCurrently `scopes` for google libraries are taken from connection parameters, this PR creates an additional parameter `impersonation_scopes` that will be used in situations when `impersonation_chain` is being used.\r\n\r\nThe flow to get credentials for gcp providers goes something like this\r\n\r\n1. A library like bigquery will call get_credentials() https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/00cd44e4ccb4a7d6406e75d3cf8f80277545d5d2/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/bigquery.py#L163\r\n2. This is provided by GoogleBaseHook https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/00cd44e4ccb4a7d6406e75d3cf8f80277545d5d2/airflow/providers/google/common/hooks/base_google.py#L307\r\n3. This then makes a call to `self.scopes()` https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/00cd44e4ccb4a7d6406e75d3cf8f80277545d5d2/airflow/providers/google/common/hooks/base_google.py#L290 \r\n4. scopes will then return scopes from connection extras or default (in `_get_scopes()`) https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/00cd44e4ccb4a7d6406e75d3cf8f80277545d5d2/airflow/providers/google/common/hooks/base_google.py#L414\r\n\r\nPossible alternative solutions\r\n\r\n1. Override `scopes()` definition in custom hook - as detailed in above issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33400#issuecomment-1678606598\r\n2. Introduce a parameter called `scopes` - it would be confusing what takes precedence if there is scopes in parameter and connection\r\n3. Create a class for impersonation https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/google.auth.impersonated_credentials.html \r\n\r\nI would need some help testing and bringing this over the finish line\r\n\r\nShould be able to do something like\r\n\r\n```py\r\nbq_hook = BigQueryHook(\r\n    gcp_conn_id=\"my_con\",\r\n    impersonation_chain=\"service-account@myproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\r\n    use_legacy_sql=False,\r\n    location=\"us\",\r\n    api_resource_configs={\"query\": {\"useQueryCache\": False, \"priority\": \"BATCH\"}},\r\n    scopes = (\r\n    \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\",\r\n    \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\",\r\n    ),\r\n)\r\nbq_hook.scopes  # check that it got set\r\n```","created_at":"2024-03-15T05:31:52Z","updated_at":"2024-03-31T17:32:31Z","closed_at":"2024-03-30T08:03:39Z","merged_at":"2024-03-30T08:03:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f513472a72c04757a3fd16d4805b9048253a05c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

PR adds a config to avoid immediately running a DAG run when first unpausing a DAG with `catchup=False`.\r\n\r\nThis is a common issue during e.g. migrations, where people expect that unpausing a DAG with `catchup=False` will wait for the next interval to complete, and only then run the first interval. However, it currently immediately executes the first DAG runs.\r\n\r\nSince this would be a breaking change, I suggest this behaviour should be fixed in Airflow 3.0.0. To support this temporarily in Airflow 2.*, I suggest introducing a config `AIRFLOW__SCHEDULER__CATCHUP_FALSE_NO_DAGRUN_AIRFLOW_2_FIX`, which is default `False`, but can be set to `True` to enable this fix.\r\n\r\nCreating a draft for feedback. TODOs are add tests, docs, and support all timetables (currently only cron-based timetable supported).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

log dir permission was changed by log handler, we've implemented also changing permissions of parent folders recursively, however it was quite a bit too much to change it for home directory where the log folder could have been created - because in some cases changing permissions might lead to unexpected side-effects - such as loosing ability to login to ssh server.\r\n\r\nFixes:

This workflow calls the regular unit test 1) workflow\r\n   for each such special case - adding one more level of indirection\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

was going to ask this as a question, but decided to do it as a PR instead given how simple the change is.\r\n\r\nI was writing a listener, and it seems extremely hard to get some information on the error in the `on_task_instance_failed` callback, because the error is not passed as a parameter to the callback itself :disappointed:\r\n\r\nIt's [written to the context](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9e97433dc3368138431305c5161a007e4fc5f227/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L2809-L2810) a bit further down, but we don't have that yet when the callback is called.\r\n\r\nWe cannot add an extra parameter now because it'd be a breaking change, but what do you think about storing the error in the TaskInstance object before calling `on_task_instance_failed` ?

#38107 switched to smaller ARM instances, and removed moving docker service to tmpfs, but it also removed docker service starting from the instances. As an effect cache building would be much slower - because it would not use the remote docker builder (as the remote docker instance was not running). MUCH slower. The effect of it was not noticeable in the PR but full cache rebuild would take about an hour or so.\r\n\r\nStarting docker service on remote machine should fix it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

UV tool is iterating super-quickly with multiple releases a week and until it slows down we do not want to be notified about every release. Still in the CI the update will be running and we will be able to see if there is a new version, but canary builds will not fail when new version of uv is released. The build will fail when a new version of `pip` is released and we will still be able to update uv independently by running the same pre-commmit manually.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

a new PR based on #37927 where the feature branch merge got messed up...\r\n\r\nFix for unhandled exceptions raised in the triggerer tests on the queue listener thread.\r\n\r\nThe queue listener was being killed due to missing a reference to the triggerer_job. Fixing this resulted in console logging during tests. So changes also include disabling the console logging handler / queue listener during tests.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a bug in tests/jobs/test_triggerer_job.py::test_trigger_create_race_condition_18392 which caused another unhandled exception.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```\r\ntests/jobs/test_triggerer_job.py::test_trigger_logging_sensitive_info

After discussion on the [airflow dev list](https://lists.apache.org/thread/hy9cjnplsyqcmpojl2q0c71thwbos77g) we came to an agreement that the operator could be added as part of the Microsoft Azure provider.  This is my initial commit so any suggestions are welcome, I still need to add examples and propably need to update some docstrings but this PR can already give an idea of what will be added.  I already created a PR so I can see what comes out of the Airflow QA.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, our article on how we use the operator at Infrabel has been published on the Apache Airflow medium:\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/apache-airflow/optimizing-integration-with-the-ms-graph-api-and-power-bi-with-the-msgraphasyncoperator-in-airflow-d1071f7c1b62\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

is another step of decomposing our workflows and introducing more DRY approach for GitHub Actions workflows we have. Building cache started to take more time and space as we started to build 5 images at the same time with Python 3.12 inclusion, so optimizing the builds now is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThere are several optimizations here:\r\n\r\n1) Instead of building images in parallel on bigger instances, we\r\n   rather choose to start small ARM instances with less CPUs but\r\n   build one image per instance. This will make them generally\r\n   faster with the same price (less contention) at the expense\r\n   of using more AMD instances to drive them\r\n\r\n2) However we also make sure to build both AMD and ARM cache at\r\n   the same time in parallel - the AMD on the driving AMD instance and\r\n   the ARM on the ARM instance. This will make the AMD instances also\r\n   busy while ARM instance is building their images - and AMD instance\r\n   will be finishing faster in general rather than waiting for all the\r\n   5 images to complete.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish it we change the parallelism model when the `--prepare-buildx-cache` command is used - instead of parallelising with python versions we parallelise with the platforms, which allows to run both AMD and ARM image in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis change also removes building ARM image in build-images step as it is not really needed for anything - we already do such build in the CI workflow and builing it again in \"build images\" workflow is superfluous.\r\n\r\nBuilds on changes implemented in #37865 and #38057\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

case images are built in the \"pull-request-target\" workflow, we should skip the builds \"in-workflow\" - but just \"skipping\" them is no good because skip state propagates to downstream jobs - but this leads - in naive implementation of build matrix to a number of jobs that start and end immediately.\r\n\r\nInstead we can simply use empty matrix for the builds - this will make it much better

actions has strange and complex way of getting conditional jobs. When you want a job to depend on another job to be running when it is either successful of fully skipped, you have to write a rather peculiar condition:\r\n\r\n```\r\nalways() && !failure() && !cancelled()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it turned out that this condition does not propoagate to to task that depends on the downstream tasks - for example if \"wait-for-ci-images\" had this condition and preceding \"build-ci-images\" was skipped, the \"wait-for-ci-images\" was happily running, but any of the other jobs that depended on \"wait-for-ci-images\" has been skipped :(. Simply - skipping tasks immediately propagates to all the downstream tasks and we cannot easily mitigate it.\r\n\r\nThis means that we have to come back to a solution that was implemented before #38057 - where instead of skipping the whole job, we skip all the steps in this kob. That makes it a little more clunky but makes the skipping status not propagate to downstream jobs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

It also add the possibility to fully disable probes.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to use `httpGet` probe rather than the `exec` one configured at the moment, I figured out that it would be simpler to be able to fully customize the probe rather that to add many variables. \r\n\r\nExample of the probe I would like to use \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    readinessProbe:                  \r\n      failureThreshold: 10\r\n      httpGet:                                \r\n        path: /flower/\r\n        port: 5555                     \r\n        scheme: HTTP   \r\n      initialDelaySeconds: 10                 \r\n      periodSeconds: 5\r\n      successThreshold: 1\r\n      timeoutSeconds: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want a probe like this because I use `FLOWER_URL_PREFIX=/flower` and I need the probe to be able to query the right path.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Initially I had fixed #37891 and realised that a bigger effort is needed to move everything to breeze. This PR moves issue generation from prepare_release_issue.py to breeze release-management and introduces two new commands.\r\n\r\nThe usage looks like this:\r\n```\r\nbreeze release-management generate-issue-content-core --previous-release 1.9.0 --current-release 1.10.0 --verbose\r\nbreeze release-management generate-issue-content-helm-chart --previous-release 1.6.0 --current-release 1.8.0 --verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested for helm chart as well as airflow core.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n```\r\nroot@d4e667edbe5e:~/clone/airflow# ./dev/prepare_release_issue.py generate-issue-content --previous-release 1.9.0 --current-release ${VERSION}\r\nRetrieving PR#3701: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3701\r\nRetrieving PR#3720: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3720\r\nRetrieving PR#3708: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3708\r\nRetrieving PR#3700: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3700\r\nRetrieving PR#3703: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3703\r\nRetrieving PR#3660: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3660\r\nRetrieving PR#24: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24\r\nRetrieving 7 PRs  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00\r\nWe are kindly requesting that contributors to [Apache Airflow RC 1.10.0](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/1.10.0/) help test the RC.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know by commenting if the issue is addressed in the latest RC.\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Fix run_unit_tests.sh (#24)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24): @afarbos\r\n- [ ] [[AIRFLOW-2817] Force explicit choice on GPL dependency (#3660)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3660): @bolkedebruin\r\n- [ ] [[AIRFLOW-2140] Don't require kubernetes for the SparkSubmit hook (#3700)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3700): @ashb\r\n- [ ] [[AIRFLOW-2856] Pass in SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE=yes ENV to docker run (#3701)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3701): @andscoop\r\n- [ ] [[AIRFLOW-2857] Fix broken RTD env  (#3703)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3703): @tedmiston\r\n- [ ] [[AIRFLOW-2859] Implement own UtcDateTime (#3708)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3708): @bolkedebruin\r\n- [ ] [[AIRFLOW-2870] Use abstract TaskInstance for migration (#3720)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3720): @bolkedebruin\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to all who contributed to the release (probably not a complete list!):\r\n@afarbos @andscoop @tedmiston @ashb @bolkedebruin\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n(new-env) ➜  airflow git:(issueContentToBreeze) ✗ breeze release-management generate-issue-content-core --previous-release 1.9.0 --current-release 1.10.0 --verbose\r\n/Users/adesai/.local/pipx/venvs/apache-airflow-breeze/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3/__init__.py:34: NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2.0 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently the 'ssl' module is compiled with 'LibreSSL 2.8.3'.

No documentation is provided, intentionally, since the AIP-61 feature is not yet complete. I am slowly implementing pieces instead of one giant PR. A warning is shown if a user attempts to provide a value for this parameter to any operators.\r\n\r\nI've done manual UAT with these changes (hello world dag, triggere dag, mapped task, task flow, etc) and all seems to be functioning.\r\n\r\nI have some open question in the code which I've annotated with comments in the PR as well.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#36484\r\n\r\nThis PR renames `SparkSubmitOperator`'s fields' names to comply with templated fields validation.\r\nIt also optimizes derived `SparkJDBCOperator` constructor by delegating parents' attributes to `**kwargs` to avoid repetition of parameters (templated fields were among them).\r\nTests were added for both operators to ensure correct templating.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the

need to exclude Cassandra separately, in order to make sure that cassandra drivers are not installed in the Python 3.12 image when preparing it from the main branch.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking the dependencies are cached from the main branch when image is built, which means that the resulting image will still have cassandra driver even if we remove it in final pyproject.toml.\r\n\r\nThe way how to get rid of it is two fold:\r\n\r\n1) add the exclusion to main\r\n2) after it is merged, increase the EPOCH number in the Dockerfile.ci\r\n   in the PR that adds Python 3.12

order to better address chicken-egg provider problem (in the light of upcoming release of 2.9.0 and separated FAB provider, we should make sure that providers released together with Airflow in the same pre-release version, but also with another providers they refer to, have the same suffix for version.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n* FAB released with dev0 should refer to airflow >= x.y.z.dev0\r\n* FAB released with b0 (normalized from beta0) should refer to airflow>=x.y.zb0\r\n* Postgres released with rc1 should refer to common-sql >= x.y.zrc1\r\n\r\nThis will only work when the packages released are released together in a single wave (which we should do now for Airlfow and FAB.\r\n\r\nLater on - this will be less of a problem, because this is the only time where we do not have the X.Y.Z version of Airflow released and mandatory provider (FAB) has >=X.Y.Z. At the same time airflow has fab set as mandatory provider so we need to make sure both of them are released in the same wave.\r\n\r\nBy releasing them together, we solve the chicken-egg provider problem for mandatory providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
