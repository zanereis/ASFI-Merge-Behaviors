Overview\r\n\r\nAfter fix of `fake_db` function `mem3_shards` stopped silently failing and exposed race condition in  \r\n`mem3_shards_changes_test_` test. What was going on,  the changes listener started in the test's setup was crashing when tried to register on unstarted `couch_event` server, so the test was either fast enough to do assertions before of that or failed on a dead listener process.\r\n    \r\nThis fix removing dependency on mocking all modules involved and just uses standard test_util's start and stop couch. Module's start moved into the test body  to avoid masking a potential failure in setup.\r\n\r\nAlso the tests `mem3_sync_security_test` and `mem3_util_test` been modified to avoid setup and teardown side effects.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nMinimal run  `make eunit apps=mem3 suites=mem3_sync_security_test,mem3_util_test,mem3_shards` should pass, along with complete mem3 test suite

jobs are backed off based on the number of consecutive crashes,\r\nthat is, we count the number of crashes in a row and then penalize jobs with an\r\nexponential wait based that number. After a job runs without crashing for 2\r\nminutes, we consider it healthy and stop going back in its history and looking\r\nfor crashes.\r\n\r\nPreviously a job's state was set to `crashing` only if there were any\r\nconsecutive errors. So it could have ran for 3 minutes, then user deletes the\r\nsource database, job crashes and stops. Until it runs again the state would\r\nhave been shown as `pending`. For internal accounting purposes that's correct\r\nbut it is confusing for the user because the last event in its history is a\r\ncrash.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes sure that if the last even in job's history is a crash user\r\nwill see the jobs as `crashing` with the respective crash reason.

Overview\r\n\r\nWith db headers moved into engine's state, any `fake_db` call that is trying to setup sequences for tests (e.g. in mem3_shards) crashing with context setup failed.\r\n\r\nIt's not trivial to compose a proper `engine` field outside of couch app, so instead this fix makes `fake_db` to set engine transparently, unless it provided explicitly in a payload.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nWithout this change running `make eunit apps=mem3 suites=mem3_shards` would crash with \r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    *** context setup failed ***\r\n**in function erlang:setelement/3\r\n  called as setelement(undefined,{db,1,<<\"dbs\">>,undefined,\r\n    {couch_bt_engine,undefined},\r\n    nil,nil,undefined,undefined,\r\n    {user_ctx,null,[],undefined},\r\n    [],undefined,nil,nil,...},0)\r\nin call from test_util:'-fake_db/1-fun-0-'/3 (src/test_util.erl, line 244)\r\nin call from lists:foldl/3 (lists.erl, line 1261)\r\nin call from

Skipped: 0.  Passed: 10.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was not exposed by travis because in eunit crash in context setup doesn't count as a failure.\r\n\r\nWith this change the same command should pass successfully with `All 11 tests passed.`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

supersedes #1200.\r\n\r\n## New Behaviour\r\n\r\nThis variant introduces no new config variable and no formula, instead, there is a set of three hurdles each doc write has to pass:\r\n\r\n1. doc body size\r\n2. individual attachment size\r\n3. length of multipart representation of full doc body and including attachments.\r\n\r\nThe validation path is now the following:\r\n\r\n- If a new doc body is > `max_document_size`, we throw an error.\r\n- If a new attachment is > `max_attachment_size`, we throw an error.\r\n- If the new doc body plus new and/or existing attachments is > `max_http_request_size`, we throw an error.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThis is again just a sketch to show how something like this could look like. The patch is fairly minimal, but it does include a full additional `?JSON_ENCODE` of the doc body, and some munging of the attachment stubs, that I’d like to get a performance review for. I’m sure we can make this fast if we need to, but that would require a larger patch, so it’s this sketch for now.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility \r\n\r\nThis also sets the max_document_size to 2 GB, to restore 1.x and 2.0.x compatibility as per https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1200#issuecomment-370489809\r\n\r\nI’d suggest we make this a BC change in 3.0 to the suggest 64MB or whatever we feel is appropriate then.\r\n\r\n## Formalities \r\n\r\n- [x] Includes tests \r\n- [ ] Documentation has been updated // waiting for consensus before doing this\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-29T11:24:38Z","updated_at":"2022-06-07T20:15:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1253/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1253/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1253/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/e2f556d44d3d1a618aa47f54b9e592f946fb32f7","head":{"label":"janl:feat/max-req-size","ref":"feat/max-req-size","sha":"e2f556d44d3d1a618aa47f54b9e592f946fb32f7","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":701515,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDE1MTU=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"janl/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/janl/couchdb","description":"Mirror

when the server decided too much data was sent in the client's\r\nrequest, it would immediately send a 413 response and close the socket. In the\r\nmeantime there could be unread data on the socket since the client keeps\r\nstreaming data. When this happens the connection is reset instead of going\r\nthrough regular close sequence. The client, specifically the replicator client,\r\ndetected the reset before it had a chance to process the 413 response. This\r\nlead to a retry, since it was interpreted as generic network error, instead of\r\na proper 413 HTTP error.\r\n\r\nThe improvement is to flush the receive socket before and after sending a 413\r\nresponse, then close the connection. This reduces the chance of the socket\r\nbeing closed with unread data, avoids a TCP reset, and gives the client a\r\nbetter chance of parsing the 413 response. This is mostly geared to work with\r\nthe replicator client but should help other clients as well.\r\n\r\nAlso the connection on both the server and the client sides is closed after a\r\n413 event. This avoids a few race conditions were it is not clear how much data\r\nis on the socket after the 413 is processed. On the server side, the `close`\r\nresponse header is set and socket is closed. On the client side, a flag is set\r\nsuch that right before the worker release back to the pool it is stopped, which\r\ncloses the socket.\r\n\r\nAlso re-enable the previously disabled `replicate_one_with_attachment` test.\r\n\r\nTo test run this for a while:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake soak-eunit apps=couch_replicator suites=couch_replicator_small_max_request_size_target\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nAs discussed in\r\nhttp://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/binaryhandling.html, the\r\nbin_opt_info option can have the compiler print information about\r\nbinary optimizations. Typically, it issues warnings about code that\r\ncan not be optimized. For example, with the option enabled, it warns\r\nabout this line of code (among many others) like this:\r\n```\r\nsrc/chttpd/src/chttpd_auth_cache.erl:183: Warning: NOT OPTIMIZED: sub binary is used or returned\r\n```\r\nNot only should having this option enabled draw awareness to existing\r\nsub-optimal binary constructs, it should help developers avoid\r\ncreating new ones.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\nThis is a compiler configuration change, so test it by running `make clean && make`. You should now see numerous warnings about failed binary optimizations such as\r\n```\r\n/Users/jay/proj/couchdb/src/couch_replicator/src/couch_replicator_api_wrap.erl:401: Warning: INFO: matching anything else but a plain variable to the left of binary pattern will prevent delayed sub binary optimization; SUGGEST changing argument

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

That it didn't is presumably a dialyzer bug. In any case, run `make dialyze` should show no additional type check errors.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could

PR addresses a number of issues with the Compaction Daemon when run under a db-per-user scenario:\r\n\r\n1. with many database and/or many view groups in one or more databases, checking whether a file should be compacted can create significant CPU load. This PR both:\r\n   1. spaces the `check_interval` from 5 minutes to 60 minutes,\r\n   2. and introduces a 3 second `snooze_period` between compacting any two files.\r\n2. when a view index is opened or closed, we send a `notice` level log line. In this scenario, this balloons the log file for no good benefit. The logs are not demoted to `debug`.\r\n\r\n- [x] code works\r\n- [x] no tests\r\n- [x] documented in

the text below is written in a style that would allow it to be included in the CouchDB 2.2.0 documentation and/or release notes.*\r\n\r\n# CouchDB Request Size Limits\r\n\r\nThere are multiple configuration variables for CouchDB that determine request size limits. This document explains the configuration variables, how they work together, and why they exist in the first place\r\n\r\n## Why Limit Requests by Size\r\n\r\nAllowing requests of unlimited size to any network server is a [denial of service vector](wikipedia: denial of service). To allow safe operation of CouchDB, even on a network with hostile third parties, various request size limits exist.\r\n\r\n## The Request Size Limits\r\n\r\n`max_http_request_size`: the maximum number bytes a request to a CouchDB server can have.\r\n\r\n`max_document_size`: the maximum number of bytes for a JSON document written to CouchDB.\r\n\r\n`max_attachment_size`: the maximum number of bytes for any one attachment written to CouchDB.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct ways of getting data into CouchDB:\r\n\r\n1. The standard JSON Document API, which uses plain JSON, if binary data is involved, it has to be encoded as base64. The base64 option only exists for legacy reasons and it is not recommended to be used.\r\n2. The standalone attachment API, which allows transferring of binary attachment data without encoding as base64.\r\n3. The multipart HTTP API: it allows the mix of JSON data and binary attachment data without encoding as base64. The CouchDB replicator uses this.\r\n\r\nIn version 2.1, CouchDB started enforcing a 64MB limit for `max_http_request_size` on all requests, but did not apply this to the standalone attachment API.\r\n\r\nThis had the unfortunate side effect that one could create a doc that is smaller than `max_http_request_size` with an attachment that is bigger than `max_http_request_size`. In addition, one could create a doc with two or more attachments that were each smaller than `max_http_request_size` but together bigger than `max_http_request_size`. The result in this scenario now is that these documents could no longer be replicated to CouchDB nodes with the same default configuration (or even to the same node).\r\n\r\nRegardless to say, this is a very unfortunate user experience: create a number of documents with attachments, and at some not immediately obvious point, replications start failing.\r\n\r\n### Large Documents and Attachments\r\n\r\nWhile CouchDB works reasonably well with almost any sort of JSON data sizes and attachment sizes. The development team makes recommendations as to the various limits for ideal and optimal uses. CouchDB users may vary from these recommendations, but will need to be okay with the resulting operational implications, like increased CPU & RAM usage as well as increased latency for many core operations.\r\n\r\nBefore CouchDB 2.1.0 there were no real limits imposed, and before CouchDB 2.2.0 the available limits weren’t applied uniformly, leading to surprising behaviour as for example  outlined above.\r\n\r\nCouchDB 2.2.0 and later aims to have a complete set of limits that avoids any unexpected behaviour, but the limits imposed won’t be set by default in order to preserve backwards compatibility. Starting with \r\n\r\nCouchDB 3.0.0 the recommended limits will be set by default and users migrating from earlier versions of CouchDB need to adjust them, if their use-case requires it. The CouchDB team might produce a utility script that would allow to determine the required settings from an existing CouchDB installation, if resources can be made available for this.\r\n\r\nStarting with CouchDB 2.2.0, the CouchDB distribution will come with an additional configuration file local.ini-recommended* with the developer-recommended defaults and explanations for what happens when these defaults are exceeded.\r\n\r\n*An alternative solution could avoid using the `max_attachments_per_doc` and reject attachment additions based on the existing doc + attachments size plus the new attachment size, but this PR/Discussion suggests that having another config value with sensible defaults here will nudge users into doing the right thing*\r\n\r\n## Limits by Version\r\n\r\nIn order to account for all use-cases and the interplay of the different APIs, CouchDB 2.2.0 introduces a new limit `max_attachments_per_document`. This allows the application of a formula to show the interplay of all limits:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmax_http_request_size = max_document_size + multipart HTTP boundary data\r\n                        + max_attachments_per_doc\r\n                        * (max_attachment_size + multipart HTTP boundary data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this formula, any doc update (JSON or attachments) can check whether it would exceed `max_http_request_size` which would cause replication to fail.\r\n\r\nCouchDB Version | `max_http_request_size` | `max_document_size` | `max_attachment_size` | `max_attachments_per_document*`\r\n----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------\r\n2.0.0 and earlier | unlimited | 4GB | N/a | N/a\r\n2.1.0 | 64MB | 4GB | Unlimited | N/a\r\n2.2.0* | 64MB | 4GB | Unlimited | Unlimited\r\n3.0.0* | 64MB | 4MB | 6MB | 10\r\n\r\n* Proposed names and values\r\n\r\nThe table shows the approximate sizes (sans HTTP multipart boundaries) for all limits. CouchDB versions earlier than 3.0.0 will still encounter the behaviour of not being able to replicate documents that have attachments that alone or together exceed `max_http_request_size`.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nThis draft implementation introduces the new `max_attachments_per_document` to show how it could work. Tests will need to be added to validate that all three API routes are covered (casual review suggests they are, but we do, of course need tests). I stopped short of adding tests so we can discuss the details of this suggestion first.\r\n\r\n# To 2.2.0 or not to 2.2.0\r\n\r\nSince we started on [the 2.2.0 milestone](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/milestone/3), this might be too big a thing to discuss and finish. I’d be very okay with bumping this to 2.3.0 as long as we document the behaviour in the 2.2.0 release notes.","created_at":"2018-03-03T14:24:03Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T18:58:35Z","closed_at":"2018-03-29T11:26:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"966c21c45ff702093c24341d0c7c36443d0f96ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":594290962,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTQyOTA5NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"6d2faa","default":false,"description":""},{"id":594291183,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTQyOTExODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"5EBEFF","default":true,"description":null},{"id":594291312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTQyOTEzMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"91CA55","default":false,"description":null},{"id":659572454,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NTk1NzI0NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/need%20more%20info","name":"need

Overview\r\n\r\nCouchDB currently has support for `_bulk_get` requests which are intended to improve performance of client pull replications, by allowing the client to request multiple documents in one request. But current implementation has some limitations namely: attachment bodies can only be encoded inline (base64) not as MIME multipart bodies. Another issue which is much more important I believe: current _bulk_get implementation in CouchDB is not compatible with the [Couchbase Lite 1.4.x](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/tree/release/1.4.1) for iOS and Android which powers plenty of CouchDB mobile clients (in our company as well) as a replication and persistence layer. This is because CBL's `BulkDownloader` accepts [multipart/related content type](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/blob/release/1.4.1/Source/CBLBulkDownloader.m#L85) and not `application/json`. I understand that probably this was done to make life easier for web clients and in-browser DBs such as [PouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb) or whatnot, but still this functionality might be extended to provide even more use cases for CouchDB’s `_bulk_get`. In order to sum up I believe that this is a must-have feature. \r\nThis PR adds support for `multipart/related`/`multipart/mixed` bulk get response which is compatible with Couchbase Lite and [Sync Gateway](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/wiki/Bulk-GET) implementations. At first I implemented this functionality in our own CouchDB 2.x fork which we run in production, because this was very crucial for us, as I mentioned before, but then we realised that it would be great to contribute this to the upstream CouchDB as well. \r\nLogic and implementation is pretty straightforward and compact: depending on the `case MochiReq:accepts_content_type(\"multipart/mixed\" or \"multipart/related\")` I pick either a default CouchDB's `_bulk_get` implementation or a multipart one which is based on existing `couch_doc:doc_to_multi_part_stream()` and `couch_httpd_db:encode_multipart_stream()` functionality.\r\nWe’ve already tested this with some of our production CouchDB databases and speedup was very perceptible. I think this feature will be very useful because there may be a lot of Couchbase Lite <-> CouchDB users who can't benefit from the` _bulk_get` because of `application/json`-only response. Moreover this is a completely additive change which doesn't break or change existing functionality. Test suite is completely based on the `chttpd_db_bulk_get_test` I've just changed test fixture and some helpers a little bit.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nFor testing create a `db1`, put some docs there: \r\n```\r\ncurl -u admin:pass -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1\r\ncurl -u admin:pass -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1/doc1 -d '{\"type\":\"a\"}'\r\ncurl -u admin:pass -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1/doc2 -d '{\"type\":\"a\"}'\r\ncurl -u admin:pass -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1/doc3 -d '{\"type\":\"b\"}'\r\n```\r\nAlso add attachments for some of the docs (.png images or whatnot). \r\nAdd this request body to `bulkGetBody.txt`file (revisions have to be the same as in the corresponding documents):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"docs\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"doc1\",\r\n\t\t\t\"rev\": \"3-22e6a8c0ef498f4d23b76ecaa58125ab\"\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"doc2\",\r\n\t\t\t\"rev\": \"4-cf4a89993599f6e8c0e3b22d617284b5\"\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"doc3\",\r\n\t\t\t\"rev\": \"14-db7f140e90ac3c45f7610eb496d1f883\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter this you can execute this curl command:\r\n```\r\ncurl -u admin:pass -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Accept: multipart/related\" -H \"X-Accept-Part-Encoding: gzip\" --data \"@bulkGetBody.txt\" -o \"response.txt\" http://127.0.0.1:5983/db1/_bulk_get?revs=true&attachments=true\r\n```\r\nThen in the `response.txt` you can observe this:\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----------------------------6ee0167da37f8532e116048afff16018\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\n\r\n{\"_id\":\"doc1\",\"_rev\":\"3-22e6a8c0ef498f4d23b76ecaa58125ab\",\"type\":\"global-local\",\"_revisions\":{\"start\":3,\"ids\":[\"22e6a8c0ef498f4d23b76ecaa58125ab\",\"2a72890299a3d2039bdbcf8ef995e11a\",\"3b39bc699524dd81add4d6c082a7246c\"]}}\r\n-----------------------------6ee0167da37f8532e116048afff16018\r\nX-Doc-Id: doc2\r\nX-Rev-Id: 4-cf4a89993599f6e8c0e3b22d617284b5\r\nContent-Type: multipart/related;

In order to do this just set [_canBulkGet](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/blob/release/1.4.1/Source/CBLRestPuller.m#L488) variable to `YES` and then replicate db1 to iOS mobile device.\r\n \r\nI checked `Documentation reflects the changes` checkbox because I described the change quite meticulously and if this PR will be merged I would be delighted to update CouchDB docs as well. By the way I wasn't able to find a description for current `_bulk_doc` request in the docs  either so I can contribute to both.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

we run Jenkins CI builds on 11 platforms:\r\n\r\nErlang 18.3 + [centos6|centos7|debian8|debian9|ubuntu1404|ubuntu1604]\r\n\"Default\" (ships-with-the-distro) Erlang + [same list but not centos6]\r\n\r\nThe intent was ensure that CouchDB ran fine both with our preferred\r\nErlang version (right now, 18.3) as well as the Erlang that ships with\r\nvarious common distributions. This would help ease consumption of\r\nCouchDB by end users, we thought.\r\n\r\nWith CouchDB 2.1.0 we started providing convenience binary packages,\r\nbuilt with Erlang 18.3. This (along with Docker) has become the most\r\ncommon way people consume CouchDB today. Those binaries are generated\r\ndirectly from the Jenkins builds.\r\n\r\nFurther, Travis CI already runs our test suite against a variety of\r\nErlang distributions, from 16B03 right through 20.1 (as of today).\r\n\r\nThere is little value in the extra Jenkins runs at this point, beyond\r\ncatching any vagaries of distro-specific Erlang weirdness that we\r\nwould probably wash our hands of anyway.\r\n\r\nThis change removes 5 of our 11 platform builds. This will be valuable\r\nas we move towards regression testing other platforms (ppc64le, arm).\r\nIt also lightens our load on the ASF Jenkins infrastructure.\r\n\r\nNOTE that we will still need to maintain the Docker image for\r\nubuntu1404erlangdefault, as this contains 16B03, the earliest version\r\nof Erlang that we support.

Overview\r\n\r\nThe spec of `couch_key_tree:merge/2` doesn't include the `path()`\r\ntype. However we pass `path()` in few places. One of such places is\r\n`couch_db:prep_and_validate_replicated_updates/5`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{NewTree, _} = couch_key_tree:merge(AccTree,\r\n    couch_doc:to_path(NewDoc), RevsLimit),\r\nNewTree\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe spec for `couch_doc:to_path/1` is defined as:\r\n```\r\n-spec to_path(#doc{}) -> path().\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `path()` type to `couch_key_tree:merge/2` spec.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun dialyzer tool and make sure there are no complains about `couch_key_tree:merge`\r\n1. Prepare for analysis:\r\n  ```\r\nmake build-plt\r\n  ```\r\n2. Run analysis \r\n  ```\r\nmake dialyze apps=couch\r\n  ```\r\nThe dialyzer might fail but it shouldn't fail in analysis of `couch_key_tree`, `couch_db` or `test_engine_util`.\r\n\r\n##

Overview\r\n\r\nThe `couch_att:from_disk_term` function is responible for conversion of\r\na disk format to #att{} record. However the way it is called\r\nproduces a dialyzer complaint.\r\nBecause `couch_att:from_disk_term` is always called as\r\n`[couch_att:from_disk_term(Db, T) || T <- Doc1#doc.atts]`.\r\n\r\nThe `atts` field of `#doc{}` record is defined as\r\n`[couch_att:att()] | binary()`\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because `att()` definition doesn't include disk\r\nformat representation. This commit adds disk format to the spec.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun dialyzer tool and make sure there are no complains about `couch_att:from_disk_term`\r\n1. Prepare for analysis:\r\n  ```\r\nmake build-plt\r\n  ```\r\n2. Run analysis \r\n  ```\r\nmake dialyze apps=couch\r\n  ```\r\nThe dialyzer might fail but it shouldn't fail in analysis of couch_att.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-01T22:02:02Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T11:41:44Z","closed_at":"2018-03-09T11:41:44Z","merged_at":"2018-03-09T11:41:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c26bc301a2793b83205a197ef16bf449fbc4f9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1190/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1190/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1190/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/af4ad038a9349a7d1768b0ceadf7b99d6a1e2484","head":{"label":"cloudant:fix-dialyzer-couch_att","ref":"fix-dialyzer-couch_att","sha":"af4ad038a9349a7d1768b0ceadf7b99d6a1e2484","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

But it can also be used to purge any document (deleted or non-deleted) with any number of revisions.\r\n\r\nClustered Purge was designed to maintain eventual consistency and prevent unnecessary invalidation of secondary indexes. For this, every database keeps track of a certain number of historical purges requested in the database, as well as its current ``purge_seq``. Internal replications and secondary indexes process database's purges and periodically update their corresponding purge checkpoint documents to report ``purge_seq`` processed by them. To ensure eventual consistency, the database will remove store historical purges only after they have been processed by internal replication jobs and secondary indexes.\r\n\r\n## Testing

The motivation for this ground work is NOT to break internal replication between nodes. \r\n\r\nFor clustered purge during internal replication, additional step was added to synchronize purges. This work involves creating a stub function for synchronizing purges that returns an empty list of purges, as well as, creating duplicates of some other functions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we added logic to support downgrade of couch database to the previous format in case of the need of rollback of clustered purge.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\nThere's no behavior changes so the existing test suite covers the existing logic.\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue number\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-3326\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\nWe are going to open another PR for COUCHDB-3326 which is the main Clustered Purge work that will be asking to merge into this PR.

Overview\r\n\r\nImplement pluggable authentication and session support for replicator\r\n\r\nPreviously replicator used only basic authentication. It was simple and\r\nstraightforward. However, with PBKDF2 hashing becoming the default it would be\r\nnice not to do all the password verification work with every single request,\r\nand instead take advantage of session (cookie) based authentication.\r\n\r\n ### Description\r\n\r\nThis commit implements session based authentication via a plugin mechanism.\r\nThe list of available replicator auth modules is configurable:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[replicator]\r\nauth_plugins = couch_replicator_auth_session,couch_replicator_auth_noop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plugins will be tried in order. The first one to successfully initialize\r\nwill end up being used for that endpoint (source or target).\r\n\r\nDuring the initialization callback, a plugin could decide it cannot be used in\r\nthe current context. In that case it signals to be \"ignored\". The plugin\r\nframework will then skip over it and try to initialize the next on in the list.\r\n\r\n`couch_replicator_auth_basic` effectively implements the old behavior. This\r\nplugin should normally be used as a default catch-all at the end of the plugin\r\nlist. In some cases, it might be useful to enforce exclusive use of\r\nsession-based auth and fail replication jobs if it is not available.\r\n\r\n`couch_replicator_auth_session` does most of the work of handling session based\r\nauthentication. On initialization, it strips away basic auth credentials from\r\nheaders and url to avoid basic auth being used on the server. Then it is in\r\ncharge of periodically issuing POST requests to `_session`, updating the\r\nheaders of each request with the latest cookie value, and possibly picking up\r\nnew session cookie if the server can issue them along with reglar responses.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #1153 this work also removes OAuth 1.0 support. After\r\nserver-side support was removed, it had stopped working anyway since the main\r\noauth app was removed. However, with the plugin framework in place it would be\r\npossible for someone to implement it as a separate module not entangled with\r\nthe rest of the replicator code.\r\n\r\nFixes

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen we tested CouchDB 2.1 with our production DB which contains gazillion of different documents `couch_mrview_util:reduced_external_size()` crashed with `badmatch` error randomly because of some broken docs in our DB. This is because `full_reduce` returned response in the format `{_, _}` (no nested tuple)  and not `{ok, {_, _}}` as was expected there. After this crash CouchDB was broken completely for me. In order to fix this I added an additional \"match-anything\" case clause, because even if we had something really broken in our DB, CouchDB still should handle this more gracefully I believe. \r\n\r\nP.S. I wasn't sure what is better: add a wildcard `_` after `{ok, {_, _}} -> 0` or  just replace latter with it. Feel free to suggest.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nUnfortunately can't describe formal steps because this thing happened randomly for us several times on one of the production databases. But I think expecting that `full_reduce` may return another response is good instead of crashing Couch and polluting logs.\r\n\r\nUPD: Managed to reproduce this issue with this simple ddoc in the db:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"_id\": \"_design/index\",\r\n  \"_rev\": \"2-451ebcdefd873e3a8f76e6b3dfb83db4\",\r\n  \"language\": \"javascript\",\r\n  \"views\": {\r\n    \"type\": {\r\n      \"map\": \"function(doc){if(doc.type){log(\\\"index/type: \\\"+JSON.stringify(doc));emit(doc.type)}}\",\r\n      \"options\": {\r\n        \"seq_indexed\": true\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n

Overview\r\n\r\nThis issue hit me when I was implementing support for custom `validate_doc_read` functions (written in both native Erlang and JS), because `validate_doc_update` is not sufficient for our production use case.\r\n\r\nWhen you implement `validate_doc_update` as an Erlang function it doesn't work because of a missing case clause, namely: when `couch_query_servers:try_compile()` calls `ddoc` in the `couch_native_process` for a native `validate_doc_update` the return value may be an atom `ok` or `true` but in case of JS function we have `1`. I added an additional guard check for all these situations in the `validate_doc_update` and now it works for Erlang functions as well. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nImplement `validate_doc_update` as Erlang function in the design doc (`\"language\": \"erlang\"`), run CouchDB with `--enable-erlang-views` and update some docs in the db in order to trigger this call.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR contains small fixes for some minor flaws in CouchDB which affected me during the development of the new functionality.\r\n\r\n1. Proper error handling of `file:open/2` calls in `couch_file.erl`. According to Erlang [file module docs](http://erlang.org/doc/man/file.html#open-2) `open` returns `{error, Reason}`  in case of failure but in the `couch_file:sync` and `init` functions there are no such checks. Consequently when I received `{error, emfile}` kind of error, process crashed with `badmatch` instead of proper error. \r\n2. When you implement `validate_doc_update` as an Erlang function it doesn't work because of a missing case clause, namely: when `couch_query_servers:try_compile()` calls `proc_prompt_raw()` which in turn calls `erlang:apply()` for a native function the return value of it is an atom `ok` or `true` but in case of JS function we have response code `1`. I added a more general check in the `validate_doc_update` and now it works for Erlang functions as well. This was crucial in our case because JS functions are much slower and in our production system we are going to use validation functions implemented in Erlang.\r\n3. When we tested CouchDB 2.1 with our production DB which contains gazillion of different document `couch_mrview_util:reduced_external_size()` crashed with `badmatch` randomly because of some broken docs in our DB. This is because `full_reduce` returned response in the format `{_, _}` and not `{ok, {_, _}}` as was expected there. After this crash CouchDB was broken completely for me. In order to fix this I added an additional \"match-anything\" `case` clause, because even if we had something really broken in our DB, CouchDB still should handle this more gracefully I believe. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThese fixes were tested and they resolved all the problems i reported.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-14T14:33:38Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T15:29:03Z","closed_at":"2018-02-14T15:29:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6febf972ba1ef7d7bcdba0f7056a5d9a9a50d8da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/68c1ee927e92245103022cd839459a9821c48c7d","head":{"label":"Spotme:master","ref":"master","sha":"68c1ee927e92245103022cd839459a9821c48c7d","user":{"login":"Spotme","id":673891,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY3Mzg5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/673891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme","html_url":"https://github.com/Spotme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spotme/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d3a28715376c745a77224e65f4389cd3a31f6eec","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

https://github.com/pierrekilly/couchdb-documentation/tree/bcrypt-hashing\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [X] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\nI have forked and updated the documentation but I have an issue with it: [in the Hashing passwords section in the Security chapter](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/intro/security.html?highlight=Hashing%20Passwords) I would like to add that starting from the next release bcrypt is supported but the next release doesn't

 New endpoint is added to make sure we are not mutating response\r\n    depending on the object we receive in POST\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n * The implementation is taken from previously merged

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nIn the https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1032, queries are supported to `_all_docs`, `_design_docs` and `_local_docs` to address the requirement in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/820.\r\nHowever, the response schema changes depending on what is POSTed. This makes it quite hard to interact with from static type languages. So we plan to move the implementation to separate endpoint. As the first step, this PR is used to remove queries for _all_docs,  _design_docs and _local_docs.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nCurrent behaviour of DB creation in a cluster degraded situation is not consistent with the general behaviour described for document creation in the same situation.\r\n\r\n> The number of copies of a document with the same revision that have to be read before CouchDB returns with a 200 is equal to a half of total copies of the document plus one. It is the same for the number of nodes that need to save a document before a write is returned with 201. If there are less nodes than that number, then 202 is returned. Both read and write numbers can be specified with a request as r and w parameters accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour for database creation in a cluster is:\r\n - Database creation returns 201 - Created if all nodes responds ok\r\n - Database creation returns 202 - Accepted if the quorum is met\r\n - Database creation returns 500 - Error if the responses are bellow quorum\r\n\r\nThe quorum is the default: Number of nodes/2 +1\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the database creation result with the following behaviour:\r\n- Database creation returns 201 - Creation if the quorum is met\r\n- Database creation returns 202 - Accepted if at least one node responds ok\r\n- Database creation returns 500 - Error if there is no correct response from any node\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n- All previous tests are ok\r\n- I've focused on chttpd and javascript tests \r\n- I've skiped reduce_builtin.js test as it is failing even in master branch\r\n`test/javascript/tests/reduce_builtin.js                        \r\n    Error: {gen_server,call,[<0.2426.1>,{get_state,49},infinity]}`\r\n\r\n`make check apps=chttpd ignore_js_suites=reduce_builtin`\r\n\r\nI didn't identify testing infrastructure for testing cluster degradation issues. So I decided to add some support for testing in different cluster conditions. Now make has two more task:\r\n- test-cluster-with-quorum, which launch a three node cluster and stops one node then executes the tests\r\n- test-cluster-without-quorum which launch a three node cluster and stops two nodes then executes the tests\r\n\r\nThis PR can be tested in this way\r\n```\r\n make test-cluster-with-quorum\r\n make test-cluster-without-quorum\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\nIssue #603 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests; (DB creation yes, Cluster degradation no)\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

However, for basic authentication, the credential information is also saved in `headers` field and exposed to users. The aim of this PR is to hide credential information even if customer uses basic authentication case.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \"source\": {\r\n    \"headers\": {\r\n      \"Authorization\": *****\r\n

Overview\r\n\r\nI've accidentally overrode custom 2 mins timeout for `should_create_delete_database_continuously` tests to default 5 sec with`?_test` wrapper.  It went unnoticed in local tests and travis, since in general \"should_create_delete_database_continuously (100 times)\" passes within 1.096s, but Jenkins prove to be more sensitive.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nStandard `make eunit apps=couch` should pass. More importantly Jenkins now should not throw timeout on this test.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nFixes: #1122 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nThere are mouthful depreciation warning on epi compilation on none-ancient versions of erlang\r\n```\r\nWarning: erl_scan:token_info/2: removed in 19.0; use erl_scan:{category,column,line,location,symbol,text}/1 instead\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe module `couch_epi_codegen` actually decides what scan token to use based on `function_exported`, but the warning is thrown anyway.\r\n\r\nThe patch changes runtime choice between `erl_scan:token_info` and `erl_scan:line` to compilation conditional one based in rebar's `platform_define`.\r\n\r\nThis is getting rid of compilation deprecation warning and also should speed up things a bit.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nBasic recompile to confirm the warning is gone and `make eunit apps=couch_epi` to ensure that things are not broken.\r\n\r\nI've tested it on:\r\n- 17.5\r\n- 18.3\r\n- 19.3\r\n- 20.2\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-12T15:07:49Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T17:05:27Z","closed_at":"2018-01-12T17:05:16Z","merged_at":"2018-01-12T17:05:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"1768aeab8b9100034e374a45f1bc9b7bd72dad2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/4649ab8844a04dec1eaaf50632d7b33b3e67ac55","head":{"label":"apache:remove-warning-in-epi_codegen","ref":"remove-warning-in-epi_codegen","sha":"4649ab8844a04dec1eaaf50632d7b33b3e67ac55","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless
