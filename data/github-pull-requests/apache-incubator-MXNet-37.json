Description ##\r\nnumpy compatible multinomial\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@haojin2 @reminisce

Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-11T02:52:06Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T01:31:48Z","closed_at":"2019-06-12T01:31:48Z","merged_at":"2019-06-12T01:31:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"d32a3da7a7d8291cf383d5cf7b34533733317cd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":998884732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTg4ODQ3MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Quantization","name":"Quantization","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Issues/Feature

Description ##\r\nData Augmentation tutorial used Augmenters rather than Gluon Transforms. Updates have to been made to the tutorial to use Transforms, and new images have been hosted on web-data repository.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-10T18:48:37Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T20:46:32Z","closed_at":"2019-06-13T20:46:32Z","merged_at":"2019-06-13T20:46:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b58cf0ad55402f577288548403d433e4e4c9687a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis is a rebase version of [https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13757](url)\r\n\r\n## Details ##\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/a38278ddebfcc9459d64237086cd7977ec20c70e/example/image-classification/train_imagenet.py#L42\r\n\r\nWhen I try to train imagenet with this line commented, the train-accuracy reaches 99% while the validation-accuracy is only less than 50% (single machine, 8 GPUs, global batchsize=2048, Resnet50, fp32). Absolutely this is overfitting.\r\n\r\nThen I uncomment this line and try again with the same experiment settings. This time both train and validation accuracy converge to about 66%, which looks like normal result.\r\n\r\nThus, it seems that this data augmentation is pretty important for ImageNet training. Perhaps it will be better to uncomment this as default, so that future developers won't get confused by the overfitting issue.\r\n\r\nMy commits enable data-augmentation with command-line argument.","created_at":"2019-06-09T08:33:37Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T16:27:50Z","closed_at":"2019-07-11T22:18:36Z","merged_at":"2019-07-11T22:18:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"554b1965595fbac10052ce23987773c185ef5e04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR is waiting for code review"},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to fix this issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15183\r\nThe callback function `delete_entry` is invoked in the CAPI. In the original code, the callback function may be invoked before the context is registered. So we need to switch this two lines to make sure the context has been registered.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-07T23:10:19Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T05:12:22Z","closed_at":"2019-06-08T05:12:22Z","merged_at":"2019-06-08T05:12:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5874ddf0195f8eb49c42b320bfe685dab5c2a7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708215424,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMTU0MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Autograd","name":"Autograd","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

[x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nHi, there.\r\nIn the PR #14615, @yuxihu added `Add MXEnginePushAsync` and `MXEnginePushSync` C APIs.\r\n\r\n`MXEnginePushAsync` and `MXEnginePushSync` needs `VarHandle`s of `NDArray`s.\r\nHowever, MXNet doesn't expose the API to get the VarHandle of a NDArray.\r\n\r\nAfter the discussion with @szha, We considered that it's more elegant to add `MXEnginePushAsyncND` and `MXEnginePushSyncND` C APIs, whose arguments are `NDArrayHandle`s, rather than `VarHandle`s.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add MXEnginePushAsyncND and MXEnginePushSyncND C APIs\r\n- [x] Add the related unittest.\r\n- [x] Add a simple example:

Description ##\r\nRelated Issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15172\r\n\r\nHi, there.\r\nThe operator `mx.nd.contrib.boolean_mask` gives the wrong gradient.\r\nI have fixed it and add a unittest.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support Gradient Addition for boolean mask operator\r\n- [x] Fix the gradient bug\r\n- [x] Add a related unittest\r\n\r\n## Comment\r\nIn the CPU backward of boolean mask, it uses `BooleanMaskBackwardCPUWriteKernel` kernel to accelerate when req is `WriteTo`.","created_at":"2019-06-07T07:11:22Z","updated_at":"2019-06-09T05:12:48Z","closed_at":"2019-06-09T05:08:27Z","merged_at":"2019-06-09T05:08:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"8d8c5d523348e872433b54911c6aba47c986f58f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":206159502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDYxNTk1MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

reverts commit 65434886f6caa7210ed3ff39cd4e950c023d8328.\r\nAlso upgrades archive utility and fixes: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15084\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\n- Archive utility version 2.26 doesn't support sizes greater than 4GB. With this FC PR and the compile flags mentioned in the issue, the libmxnet.a archive grows beyond 4 GB. \r\n- The PR uses a newer archive utility version which handles such archive sizes. The current utility version wont support it, please see : https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14625\r\n- Upgrading this archive utility means that we are forcing the users to use this version of archive utility with make to build mxnet with this set of build flags.\r\n- As discussed with @larroy offline there is a bigger problem related to code bloat which should be addressed and I have opened an issue for this : https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15182\r\n- Having said that, I am suggesting that we update archive utility and update our docs. The user impact is all developers/end users who build from source and use this combination of flags. They have to upgrade their ar utility. In ubuntu 16.04 it may not be easy (build from source is one way). I am not aware of a better solution in the short term so that we can continue adding/modifying mxnet code. Other suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-07T00:40:14Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T19:16:32Z","closed_at":"2019-06-17T21:50:21Z","merged_at":"2019-06-17T21:50:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"cab1dfad37f044d691e7c4ea81d73463cfcf0c8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

[MXNET-1413], where #1413 refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR enables fusion of pointwise ops for GPU context, using runtime compilation (NVRTC). I will make and post a design doc in the near future.\r\n\r\nWork done by me, @Caenorst, @nvchai and @MoisesHer.\r\n\r\n**Important note**: this is **NOT** meant to compete with other long term compilation strategies for MXNet (like integration with TVM etc.). It is intended as a short term solution (and so e.g. does not tackle harder problems like fusion with convolutions/gemms) while those long term solutions are in development.\r\n\r\nThis is the first stage of this effort, focusing on pointwise ops that do not change the shape of the output (+ slices). Future PRs will tackle broadcast ops.\r\n\r\nFYI @zheng-da @junrushao1994 @eric-haibin-lin @szha @KellenSunderland @nvchai \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The fusion is controlled by MXNET_USE_FUSION env variable and currently on by default for GPU context (mostly to see how it will behave in the CI environment) - I will probably change it to opt-in later in the review process. \r\n- It supports both forward and backward pass\r\n- It supports rebinding with different shapes without the need of recompilation of the generated kernel.\r\n- It currently supports Symbol, Module and Gluon (only hybridized without inlining, so mostly static_alloc=True) API.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-06T22:08:25Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T18:49:49Z","closed_at":"2019-11-01T04:07:25Z","merged_at":"2019-11-01T04:07:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"4149f8b8752989fce5d80cc13f92d99774988b4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nMXNet will try to reuse NDArray during memory planning, so we need to ensure weight NDArray is still holding the original trunk data by checking its version.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @zheng-da \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-06T07:41:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T07:00:57Z","closed_at":"2019-06-11T05:53:18Z","merged_at":"2019-06-11T05:53:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b2ae571964ddebfe3965ae109364f02d10812e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nfix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15152\r\n\r\n**In summary:**\r\nroot cause of failure is num of GPUs changed from 2 to 1. NODE_LINUX_GPU is G3.8x wiht 2 GPUs and NODE_LINUX_GPU_P3 is P3.2x with 1 GPU\r\n\r\nso\r\n\r\ncontexts =[mx.gpu(0), mx.gpu(1)]  ->  [mx.gpu(0)] \r\nb length changed from 2 to 1\r\nb = [mx.nd.ones(shape, ctx) for ctx in contexts]\r\n\r\nIt seems in kvstore, when pushing a list, only len list lenght >1 , aggregation happens, and everything will be on the same context during update. But when lenght = 1, the sum/aggregation won't happen, causing update with ndarray on different context failed.

In the first version I've deliberately broken test_py2_gpu.ps1 (see line 27), so we should see that test fail and report an exit code of 0x0.

Description ##\r\nrelease notes for 1.5.0 release \r\nDo not merge until vote for 1.5.0 release is passed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T16:31:22Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T16:05:33Z","closed_at":"2019-07-23T16:05:33Z","merged_at":"2019-07-23T16:05:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"858e17115e5240553f5e7fe932643c3850433b72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis is the work in progress of the changes discussed in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15069. In stead of the original design which is to add a new api, get_summary(), to return the aggregate stats in JSON, I added a few parameters to the existing dumps().\r\n\r\nNow dumps() (MXAggregateProfileStatsPrint) supports new parameters: format which controls the return string format, sort_by which specifies by which stat should the entries be sorted, and ascending which specify whether to sort ascendingly.\r\n\r\nNew api reset() is removed from the original proposal.\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] adding parameters to

your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T01:47:40Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T03:14:17Z","closed_at":"2019-07-11T03:14:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f80d55747199e4ac48461cd32f81ba64be0708eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/034e57fe3dbd6eb88d66876a33d1937aa8423cd3","head":{"label":"xinyu-intel:naive","ref":"naive","sha":"034e57fe3dbd6eb88d66876a33d1937aa8423cd3","user":{"login":"xinyu-intel","id":17897736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17897736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123092331,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMwOTIzMzE=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"xinyu-intel/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinyu-intel","id":17897736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17897736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1294\r\n\r\nDuring data parallel training , the parameters of each layer is synchronized through parameter server after slicing them into smaller slices and synchronizing them independent to each other based on their priority. Currently priority of a layer is set as its negative index.\r\n\r\nFor more details, refer https://anandj.in/wp-content/uploads/sysml.pdf.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

directory.","created_at":"2019-06-01T20:12:26Z","updated_at":"2019-06-02T16:20:50Z","closed_at":"2019-06-02T16:20:50Z","merged_at":"2019-06-02T16:20:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"52f77c971e8a6e5c8c6942345fd6cfd058377d69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/501e30ecf5fae737c9cbe9a95c12f4cf66ff6e02","head":{"label":"Chouffe:arthur/clojure-fix-image-test-dependency-s3","ref":"arthur/clojure-fix-image-test-dependency-s3","sha":"501e30ecf5fae737c9cbe9a95c12f4cf66ff6e02","user":{"login":"Chouffe","id":2046602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDY2MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2046602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe","html_url":"https://github.com/Chouffe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":177818044,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzc4MTgwNDQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Chouffe/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Chouffe","id":2046602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDY2MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2046602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe","html_url":"https://github.com/Chouffe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chouffe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Chouffe/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

is a bug in the implementation for higher order gradient of `log`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/7b343d1fcde73b61322985580080333d9eee9e82/src/operator/tensor/elemwise_unary_op_basic.cc#L1077-L1079\r\n\r\nWe multiply  `gx * gx` where `gx = ograd * f'(x)`, getting `ograd^2 * f'(x)^2`, however we want only `ograd * f'(x)^2` which can be achieved in a similar fashion to the implementation of `_backward_log10/2`.\r\n\r\nI have validated the expected results for grad on `x`.\r\n```python\r\nfrom mxnet import nd, autograd\r\nimport numpy\r\nimport math\r\n\r\nop = lambda x: nd.log(x)\r\ngrad_op = lambda x: 1/x\r\ngrad_grad_op = lambda

(grad_op(x) * head_grad_grads).asnumpy()\r\n\r\nnumpy.testing.assert_allclose(x.grad.asnumpy(), expected_grad_grad_x, rtol=1e-7, atol=1e-7)\r\nnumpy.testing.assert_allclose(head_grads.grad.asnumpy(), expected_head_grad, rtol=1e-7, atol=1e-7)\r\n```\r\nWhich fails with current code.\r\n\r\nHave confirmed the behaviour with Pytorch as well.\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nimport numpy\r\nimport math\r\n\r\nop = lambda x: torch.log(x)\r\ngrad_op = lambda x: 1/x\r\ngrad_grad_op = lambda x: (-1/x**2)\r\n\r\nx = torch.randn(2,3)\r\nhead_grads = torch.randn(2,3)\r\nhead_grad_grads =

Description ##\r\n\r\nUsers want to bring a FP32 model, to convert it to a mixed precision model to run inference on it. This work leverages the existing work already done by @ptrendx, @Caenorst with AMP and tries to provide users with conversion APIs to convert their symbolic model or gluon model to a mixed precision model. This also adds the necessary C APIs, so that similar support for conversion APIs can be added in other frontends.\r\n\r\nThanks to all involved in prior discussions, suggestions and design review of the project (sincere apologies if I missed someone):\r\n@ptrendx, @rahul003, Sudipta Sengupta (AWS) (@sudiptasengupta), Poorna Chand Srinivas Perumalla (@bhagatindia) (AWS), Wei Xiao (AWS), @Vikas89, @lupesko, @pengzhao-intel , @ZhennanQin \r\n\r\n \r\n## API Additions (Python) ##\r\n\r\n1. Converting a symbolic model:\r\n```\r\nconvert_model(sym, arg_params, aux_params, target_dtype=\"float16\",\r\n              target_dtype_ops=None, fp32_ops=None,\r\n              conditional_fp32_ops=None, excluded_sym_names=None,\r\n              cast_optional_params=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Converting a gluon model (hybrid block):\r\n```\r\nconvert_hybrid_block(block, target_dtype=\"float16\", target_dtype_ops=None,\r\n                     fp32_ops=None, conditional_fp32_ops=None, excluded_sym_names=None,\r\n                     ctx=mx.gpu(0), cast_optional_params=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Converting a symbol:\r\n```\r\nconvert_symbol(sym, target_dtype=\"float16\", target_dtype_ops=None,\r\n               fp32_ops=None, conditional_fp32_ops=None,\r\n               excluded_sym_names=None, data_names=None, cast_optional_params=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Refactoring or Existing code changes ##\r\n### Module API (executor_group.py) ###\r\n1. Added support for retrieving input_types from the symbol and updating the input_types dict used in simple_bind.\r\n\r\n### Gluon API (parameter.py) ###\r\n1. Refactored code to support loading params from param_dict as well as file. This is used in the convert_hybrid_block API.\r\n\r\n### Test Utils API (test_utils.py) ###\r\n1. Copied download_model from example/image-classification/common/modelzoo.py to test_utils since this is a common use case and used in the tests\r\n\r\n### AMP Tests ###\r\n1. Moved the AMP tests to gpu directory since wanted to limit AMP tests to one file and wanted to add some additional tests to it which work only on GPU.\r\n\r\n## Additions ##\r\n1. Added APIs mentioned above in python/mxnet/contrib/amp/amp.py.\r\n2. C API for symbol conversion.\r\n2. Added nnvm pass in src/nnvm/low_precision_pass.cc\r\n3. Added example, tutorials and tests.\r\n\r\nFixes : https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14584\r\nDoc: https://tinyurl.com/y42kx9hl\r\n\r\nOther Flaky Tests/Bug Fixes:\r\n1. Attempts to fix: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14978\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title

(except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nWhen np_shape is turned on, the unknown parameter shapes should be -1 instead of 0.

free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n`np_shape` semantics was introduced to support future NumPy operators where scalar tensors and zero-size tensors are common to see. Due to the concern on the potential issues of backward compatibility when this semantics is enabled, such as different handling on scalar tensors w/ or w/o this semantics, [serializing/deserializing was simply marked as unsupported](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/5fc4fc53df74f276aafa51208142e657e9cfe42d/src/ndarray/ndarray.cc#L1585) when this semantics is enabled.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) developers want to enable this semantics in their work to support zero-size tensors. Simply disabling serializing/deserializing ndarrays of all types: dense, sparse, zero-size, and scalars would make their unit tests fail in `np_shape` semantics.\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration, we decided to loosen the constraint to support serialization/deserialization in the semantics of `np_shape` for ndarrays satisfying ALL the following three conditions as it would be the same as handling future NumPy ndarrays.\r\n1. The storage type MUST be default type, i.e. this is a dense ndarray.\r\n2. The ndarray CANNOT be a zero-size ndarray, i.e. with shape like `(2, 0, 3)`.\r\n3. The ndarray CANNOT be a scalar ndarray, i.e. with shape `()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title

Description ##\r\nThis PR restores the `NDArray::Save/Load` functions to 1.4.1 for keeping backward compatibility for saving/loading zero-size tensors. The issue was reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14954#issuecomment-492867737 by @DickJC123.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15063. I will rebase this PR after https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15063 is merged.\r\n\r\n@DickJC123 Since we are not going to have the NumPy shape semantics in the next release, I simply reverted the changes for serialization functions introduced by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14661. After careful thinking, I find that it's required to depend on the compatibility mode to save/load ndarrays in legacy/numpy shape semantics (we will also need a magic version number to guard this when loading). We will deal with it after introducing NumPy operators. Right now, I added `CHECK` in save/load functions indicating that numpy shape semantics cannot be turned on.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

(except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nPrevents divisions by zero in the NER example\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ X ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ X ] fix divisions by zero in NER metrics \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- this change is not backward incompatible\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-24T23:06:03Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T06:09:45Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T06:09:45Z","merged_at":"2019-05-28T06:09:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"bbab5276bed11a4f0806d7c7483c294d37d6dd2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556117,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTYxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":718413113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg0MTMxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Example","name":"Example","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n- moved train loop outside `fit()` into a new `train_epoch()` method. This allows tasks with custom train loop to use Estimator by simply overriding the `train_epoch()` method.\r\n- update precision for learning rate in LoggingHandler to accurately display low values\r\n- fix reading optimizer name from trainer object in LoggingHandler\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR renames `np_compat` to `np_shape` for being more specific, since it only affects the shape inference logic. This needs to be merged to 1.5 release.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2019-05-24T19:50:45Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T00:36:44Z","closed_at":"2019-05-26T05:21:05Z","merged_at":"2019-05-26T05:21:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"7edd69eb93462f040253600e8372d1ce0e859a2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR eliminates the test flakiness described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15034 (non-deterministic low-probability test_operator_gpu.py:test_rnntanh_bidirectional failures on P40)\r\n\r\nThe fix was to move the cudnn workspace from a per-op-instance permanent allocation to use the shared TempSpace resource.  Note that for temporary additional workspace, operators typically request space from the shared global TempSpace resource that is maintained for each gpu worker.  This was in fact the approach taken by cudnn_rnn-inl.h before it was combined with rnn-inl.h by  https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14476.  So in a sense, this PR simply reverts the portion of the 14476 PR that correlates with the flakiness, a much better result than having to revert the entire PR.\r\n\r\nSome minor code cleanup was performed around now-unused RNNOp data members `dropout_states_` and `dropout_bytes_`.\r\n \r\n@shza @lihaofd @ptrendx \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-24T00:59:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-25T05:13:40Z","closed_at":"2019-05-25T05:13:40Z","merged_at":"2019-05-25T05:13:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"136a5df3cd37ad20ffe72fd69a22ef55e3b64c25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":775221378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NzUyMjEzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/RNN","name":"RNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds a fused operator that fuses the split, bias addition, activation and multiplication operations. The code is a work in progress as it only implements the forward op for now and includes a dummy backward op implementation. When this operator is used for half precision tensors, it is required that the last dimension be a multiple of 2 in order to use the vectorized half type.\r\n\r\nThis PR is meant to be placeholder until operator fusion method is implemented in mxnet. If the fusion method does not work out for this operator, I will try to make the operator more generic and add a graph optimization pass.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds a fused slice sum operator that fuses the slice operation with a sum operation. The code is a work in progress as it only implements the forward op for now and includes a dummy backward op implementation. When the slice_sum operator is used for half precision tensors, it is required that the last dimension be a multiple of 2 in order to use the vectorized half type. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###
