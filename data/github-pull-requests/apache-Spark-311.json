What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using PySpark broadcast variables in a multi-threaded environment,  `SparkContext._pickled_broadcast_vars` becomes a shared resource.  A race condition can occur when broadcast variables that are pickled from one thread get added to the shared ` _pickled_broadcast_vars` and become part of the python command from another thread.  This PR introduces a thread-safe pickled registry using thread local storage so that when python command is pickled (causing the broadcast variable to be pickled and added to the registry) each thread will have their own view of the pickle registry to retrieve and clear the broadcast variables used.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test that causes this race condition using another

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using PySpark broadcast variables in a multi-threaded environment,  `SparkContext._pickled_broadcast_vars` becomes a shared resource.  A race condition can occur when broadcast variables that are pickled from one thread get added to the shared ` _pickled_broadcast_vars` and become part of the python command from another thread.  This PR introduces a thread-safe pickled registry using thread local storage so that when python command is pickled (causing the broadcast variable to be pickled and added to the registry) each thread will have their own view of the pickle registry to retrieve and clear the broadcast variables used.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test that causes this race condition using another thread.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-02T21:43:27Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T16:37:38Z","closed_at":"2017-08-03T16:37:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45a20e0acc95e0377da6787a763463a9d752d151","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18823/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18823/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18823/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/67b14db47b79e320ab93440de558b1716f3a4152","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:branch-2.2","ref":"branch-2.2","sha":"67b14db47b79e320ab93440de558b1716f3a4152","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently `df.na.replace(\"*\", Map[String, String](\"NULL\" -> null))` will produce exception.\r\nThis PR enables passing null/None as value in the replacement map in DataFrame.replace().\r\nNote that the replacement map keys and values should still be the same type, while the values can have a mix of null/None and that type.\r\nThis PR enables following operations for example:\r\n`df.na.replace(\"*\", Map[String, String](\"NULL\" -> null))`(scala)\r\n`df.na.replace(\"*\", Map[Any, Any](60 -> null, 70 -> 80))`(scala)\r\n`df.na.replace('Alice', None)`(python)\r\n`df.na.replace([10, 20])`(python, replacing with None is by default)\r\nOne use case could be: I want to replace all the empty strings with null/None because they were incorrectly generated and then drop all null/None data\r\n`df.na.replace(\"*\", Map(\"\" -> null)).na.drop()`(scala)\r\n`df.replace(u'', None).dropna()`(python)\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn executor, toTaskFailedReason is converted to toTaskCommitDeniedReason to avoid the inconsistency of taskState. In JobProgressListener, add case TaskCommitDenied so that now the stage killed number is been incremented other than failed number.\r\nThis pull request is picked up from: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18070 using commit: ff93ade0248baf3793ab55659042f9d7b8efbdef\r\nThe case match for TaskCommitDenied is added incrementing the correct num of killed after pull/18070.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRun a normal speculative job and check the Stage UI page, should have no failed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the Master ui add \"log directory\" display, is conducive to users to quickly find the log directory path.\r\n\r\nIn the spark application development process, we not only view the executor log and driver log, but also to see the master log and worker log, but the current UI will not show the master and worker log path, resulting in the user is not very clear to find the log path. So, I add \"log directory\" display.\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26266482/28864517-60fd4a7a-779f-11e7-896c-195646af01a0.png)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWindow rangeBetween() API should allow literal boundary, that means, the window range frame can calculate frame of double/date/timestamp.\r\n\r\nExample of the use case can be:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n\tval_timestamp,\r\n\tcate,\r\n\tavg(val_timestamp) OVER(PARTITION BY cate ORDER BY val_timestamp RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND interval 23 days 4 hours FOLLOWING)\r\nFROM testData\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the Window `rangeBetween` and `rowsBetween` API, while the legacy user code should still be valid.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new test cases both in `DataFrameWindowFunctionsSuite` and in `window.sql`.","created_at":"2017-08-02T07:40:17Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T05:26:35Z","closed_at":"2017-08-09T05:26:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"426f82f1d002be678f04ad0ff80dd216c125f211","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cec519b8cfbf1ed2a3107056ef5281a5be75ec54","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:literal-boundary","ref":"literal-boundary","sha":"cec519b8cfbf1ed2a3107056ef5281a5be75ec54","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUsing zstd compression for Spark jobs spilling 100s of TBs of data, we could reduce the amount of data written to disk by as much as 50%. This translates to significant latency gain because of reduced disk io operations. There is a degradation CPU time by 2 - 5% because of zstd compression overhead, but for jobs which are bottlenecked by disk IO, this hit can be taken. \r\n\r\n## Benchmark \r\nPlease note that this benchmark is using real world compute heavy production workload spilling TBs of data to disk\r\n\r\n|         | zstd performance as compred to LZ4   |\r\n| ------------- | -----:|\r\n| spill/shuffle bytes    | -48% |\r\n| cpu time    |    + 3% | \r\n| cpu reservation time       |    -40%|\r\n| latency     |     -40% |\r\n\r\n  \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by running few jobs spilling large amount of data on the cluster and amount of intermediate data written to disk reduced by as much as 50%.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-02T00:46:05Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T13:56:55Z","closed_at":"2017-11-01T13:56:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d16294211378003f7e10fa38b5eca215b8a277c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95e6b8bbda5404ba25f0fe84cdd59562f4f8f481","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:skedia/upstream_zstd","ref":"skedia/upstream_zstd","sha":"95e6b8bbda5404ba25f0fe84cdd59562f4f8f481","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn case of datasource tables (when they are stored in non-hive compatible way) , the schema information is recorded as table properties in hive meta-store. The alterTableStats method needs to get the schema information from table properties for data source tables before recording the column level statistics. Currently, we don't get the correct schema information and fail with java.util.NoSuchElement exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nA new test case is added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen I was investigating a flaky test, I realized that many places don't check the return value of `HDFSMetadataLog.get(batchId: Long): Option[T]`. When a batch is supposed to be there, the caller just ignores None rather than throwing an error. If some bug causes a query doesn't generate a batch metadata file, this behavior will hide it and allow the query continuing to run and finally delete metadata logs and make it hard to debug.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that places calling HDFSMetadataLog.get always check the return value.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins","created_at":"2017-08-01T18:27:53Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T04:04:29Z","closed_at":"2017-08-09T03:23:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aed0d908133aa4b50d188ff2222b9b1ede5147f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18799/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18799/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18799/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/16b02da4f75f7838006ce8a03d63e04d8bc21455","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-21596","ref":"SPARK-21596","sha":"16b02da4f75f7838006ce8a03d63e04d8bc21455","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe spark history server doesn't clean up certain history files outside the retention window leading to thousands of such files lingering around on our servers.  The log checking and clean up logic skipped 0 byte files and expired inprogress or complete history files that weren't properly parseable (not able to extract an app id or otherwise parse...)  Note these files most likely appeared to due aborted jobs or earlier spark/file system driver bugs.  To mitigate this, FsHistoryProvider.checkForLogs now internally identifies these untracked files and will remove them if they expire outside the cleaner retention window.\r\n\r\nThis is currently controlled via configuration spark.history.fs.cleaner.aggressive=true to perform more aggressive cleaning.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nImplemented a unit test that exercises the above cases without and without the aggressive cleaning to ensure correct results in all cases.  Note that FsHistoryProvider at one place uses the file system to get the current time and and at other times the local system time, this seems inconsistent/buggy but I did not attempt to fix in this commit.  I was forced to change one of the method FsHistoryProvider.getNewLastScanTime() for the test to properly mock the clock.  \r\n\r\nAlso ran a history server and touched some files to verify they were properly removed.\r\n\r\nericvandenberg@localhost /tmp/spark-events % ls -la\r\ntotal 808K\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   8 ericvandenberg  272 Jul 31 18:22 .\r\ndrwxrwxrwt 127 root\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 ericvandenberg

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the creation of a `ColumnarBatch` from `ReadOnlyColumnVectors` where previously a columnar batch could only allocate vectors internally.  This is useful for using `ArrowColumnVectors` in a batch form to do row-based iteration.  Also added `ArrowConverter.fromPayloadIterator` which converts `ArrowPayload` iterator to `InternalRow` iterator and uses a `ColumnarBatch` internally.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit test for creating a `ColumnarBatch` with `ReadOnlyColumnVectors` and a test to verify the roundtrip of rows -> ArrowPayload -> rows, using `toPayloadIterator` and `fromPayloadIterator`.","created_at":"2017-07-31T21:28:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T23:36:03Z","closed_at":"2017-08-31T04:11:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46574f4781f6263a2552cf6521dd0049df20e5df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ffcbf7522700b31f39ea1e11f681bde05d299594","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:arrow-ColumnarBatch-support-SPARK-21583","ref":"arrow-ColumnarBatch-support-SPARK-21583","sha":"ffcbf7522700b31f39ea1e11f681bde05d299594","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-21100 introduced a new `summary` method to the Scala/Java Dataset API that included  expanded statistics (vs `describe`) and control over which statistics to compute. Currently in the R API `summary` acts as an alias for `describe`. This patch updates the R API to call the new `summary` method in the JVM that includes additional statistics and ability to select which to compute.\r\n\r\nThis does not break the current interface as the present `summary` method does not take additional arguments like `describe` and the output was never meant to be used programmatically. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified and additional unit tests.","created_at":"2017-07-31T20:13:54Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T06:11:18Z","closed_at":"2017-08-22T06:11:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e208103c75c41a852fb6ac76794f07f29a08a04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18786/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18786/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18786/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c9f0f60a5bb93f21b89f9048eb7185d43c609e9","head":{"label":"aray:summary-r","ref":"summary-r","sha":"9c9f0f60a5bb93f21b89f9048eb7185d43c609e9","user":{"login":"aray","id":981982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray","html_url":"https://github.com/aray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35430088,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQzMDA4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"aray/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aray","id":981982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray","html_url":"https://github.com/aray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aray/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs described in JIRA ticket, History page is taking ~1min to load for cases when amount of jobs is 10k+.\r\nMost of the time is currently being spent on DOM manipulations and all additional costs implied by this (browser repaints and reflows).\r\nPR's goal is not to change any behavior but to optimize time of History UI rendering:\r\n\r\n1. The most costly operation is setting `innerHTML` for `duration` column within a loop, which is [extremely unperformant](https://jsperf.com/jquery-append-vs-html-list-performance/24). [Refactoring ](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/114943b21a730092aa3249b7a905b240bd46e531) this helped to get page load time **down to 10-15s**\r\n\r\n2. Second big gain bringing page load time **down to 4s** was [was achieved](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/f35fdcd5f129339fce75996e9242c88085a9b8ab) by detaching table's DOM before parsing it with DataTables jQuery plugin.\r\n\r\n3. Another chunk of improvements ([1](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/332b398db7eb3052484d436919185cb0b62b2385), [2](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/0af596a547e3a1f2b594a83cbda1f6ef559de86b), [3](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/235f164178a09e22306f05090ee1ff5f314a6710)) was focused on removing unnecessary DOM manipulations that in  total contributed ~250ms to page load time.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by existing Selenium tests in `org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServerSuite`.\r\n\r\nChanges were also tested on Criteo's spark-2.1 fork with 20k+ number of rows in the table, reducing load time to 4s.","created_at":"2017-07-31T07:58:15Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T15:21:19Z","closed_at":"2017-08-04T07:23:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f27bbf4d4687523cac3205d085d5b12b7c7e224c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18783/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18783/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18783/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a61ac1bced0a4efbae782a1f5c164dad3eb88a7","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:history-ui-perf-fix-upstream-master","ref":"history-ui-perf-fix-upstream-master","sha":"4a61ac1bced0a4efbae782a1f5c164dad3eb88a7","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDue to SI-8479, [SPARK-1093](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21578) introduced redundant [SparkContext constructors](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.scala#L148-L181). However, [SI-8479](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8479) is already fixed in Scala 2.10.5 and Scala 2.11.1. \r\n\r\nThe real reason to provide this constructor is that Java code can access `SparkContext` directly. It's Scala behavior, SI-4278. So, this PR adds an explicit testsuite, `JavaSparkContextSuite`  to prevent future regression, and fixes the outdate comment, too.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with a new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs described in JIRA ticket, History page is taking ~1min to load for cases when amount of jobs is 10k+.\r\nMost of the time is currently being spent on DOM manipulations and all additional costs implied by this (browser repaints and reflows).\r\nPR's goal is not to change any behavior but to optimize time of History UI rendering:\r\n\r\n1. The most costly operation is setting `innerHTML` for `duration` column within a loop, which is [extremely unperformant](https://jsperf.com/jquery-append-vs-html-list-performance/24). [Refactoring ](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/170dfe615883d869d1da7e581dfdbc9ce191afd6) this helped to get time **down to 10-15s**\r\n\r\n2. Second big gain bringing page load time **down to 4s** was [was achieved](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/2f72c98de4c092a29fa3a0eb9bd229d6bada25e5) by detaching table's DOM before parsing it with DataTables jQuery plugin.\r\n\r\n3. Another chunk of improvements ([1](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/07c6a3f57dfcc659d41c59bb394dbc3f8fa989e3), [2](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/14da1621e17d0301a837a24a3307db8f43a0a102), [3](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/2f72c98de4c092a29fa3a0eb9bd229d6bada25e5)) was focused on removing unnecessary DOM manipulations that in  total contributed ~250ms to page load time.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by existing Selenium tests in `org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServerSuite`. Version of HtmlUnitDriver had a bug that was preventing rendering the full table and making test `ajax rendered relative links are prefixed with uiRoot (spark.ui.proxyBase)` constantly fail.\r\n\r\nChanges were also tested on Criteo's spark-2.1 fork with 20k+ number of rows in the table, reducing load time to 4s.","created_at":"2017-07-30T22:15:10Z","updated_at":"2017-08-06T11:14:05Z","closed_at":"2017-07-31T09:08:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5dd2648e7dcc7e60aa26b947ca6a635bfa3966e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18777/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18777/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18777/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e487a4eda4cfbd311f1587ad2852688f94f3b6a9","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:history-ui-perf-fix-upstream-2.1","ref":"history-ui-perf-fix-upstream-2.1","sha":"e487a4eda4cfbd311f1587ad2852688f94f3b6a9","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr added code to print warning messages when an unsupported function `public void configure(MapredContext mapredContext)` used in `GenericUDF` and `GenericUDF`. This is because Spark does not call `configure` internally and this is error-prone.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually checked.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change fixes a particular scenario where default spark SQL can't encode (thrift) types that are generated by twitter scrooge. In particular, these types have the pattern of being a trait with a constructor defined only in a companion object, rather than a case class. The situation is described in the original issue in more detail. In this case, the type has no corresponding constructor symbol and causes an exception. This change catches the case where the type has no constructor and looks for an `apply` method on the type's companion object. There might be situations in which this approach would also fail in a new way, but it does work for the specific scrooge example.\r\n\r\nNote: this fix does not enable using scrooge thrift enums, additional work for this is necessary.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've added a single new test that failed prior to my fix. The failure is shown below. The test includes an example type that resembles what scrooge generates.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt's a backport PR for version 2.1 of spark. This change redacts senstive information (based on default password and secret regex)\r\nfrom the Spark Submit console logs. Such sensitive information is already being\r\nredacted from event logs and yarn logs, etc.\r\n\r\nUsing reference from Mark Grover <mark@apache.org> PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17047\r\n\r\nCloses #17047 for 2.1 spark vesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTesting was done manually to make sure that the console logs were not printing any\r\nsensitive information.\r\n\r\nHere's some output from the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSpark properties used, including those specified through\r\n --conf and those from the properties file /etc/spark2/conf/spark-defaults.conf:\r\n  (spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD,*********(redacted))\r\n  (spark.authenticate,false)\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen there are aliases (these aliases were added for nested fields) as parameters in `RuntimeReplaceable`, as they are not in the children expression, those aliases can't be cleaned up in analyzer rule `CleanupAliases`.\r\n\r\nAn expression `nvl(foo.foo1, \"value\")` can be resolved to two semantically different expressions in a group by query because they contain different aliases.\r\n\r\nBecause those aliases are not children of `RuntimeReplaceable` which is an `UnaryExpression`. So we can't trim the aliases out by simple transforming the expressions in `CleanupAliases`.\r\n\r\nIf we want to replace the non-children aliases in `RuntimeReplaceable`, we need to add more codes to `RuntimeReplaceable` and modify all expressions of `RuntimeReplaceable`. It makes the interface ugly IMO.\r\n\r\nConsider those aliases will be replaced later at optimization and so they're no harm, this patch chooses to simply override `canonicalized` of `RuntimeReplaceable`.\r\n\r\nOne concern is about `CleanupAliases`. Because it actually cannot clean up ALL aliases inside a plan. To make caller of this rule notice that, this patch adds a comment to `CleanupAliases`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-28T14:38:21Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:34:37Z","closed_at":"2017-07-29T17:05:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be5ea492332ef7d5985d17d30eaa5db480a711fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82d54ed769e75d2a8b74b8fb87d49904e3d405d9","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-21555","ref":"SPARK-21555","sha":"82d54ed769e75d2a8b74b8fb87d49904e3d405d9","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to separate `extended` into `examples` and `arguments` internally so that both can be separately documented and add `since` and `note` for additional information.\r\n\r\nFor `since`, it looks users sometimes get confused by, up to my knowledge, missing version information. For example, see https://www.mail-archive.com/user@spark.apache.org/msg64798.html\r\n\r\nFor few good examples to check the built documentation, please see both:\r\n`from_json` - https://spark-test.github.io/sparksqldoc/#from_json\r\n`like` - https://spark-test.github.io/sparksqldoc/#like\r\n\r\nFor `DESCRIBE FUNCTION`, `note` and `since` are added as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> DESCRIBE FUNCTION EXTENDED rlike;\r\n...\r\nExtended Usage:\r\n    Arguments:\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n    Examples:\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n    Note:\r\n      Use LIKE to match with simple string pattern\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n> DESCRIBE FUNCTION EXTENDED to_json;\r\n...\r\n    Examples:\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n    Since: 2.2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the complete documentation, see https://spark-test.github.io/sparksqldoc/\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests and existing tests. Please see https://spark-test.github.io/sparksqldoc\r\n\r\nJenkins tests are needed to double check","created_at":"2017-07-27T09:59:37Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:37:56Z","closed_at":"2017-08-05T17:13:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e90d24dc3570703249890213cee63a6895ea4e8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/974eab27d77169c7bc7205595e3702b300002865","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:followup-sql-doc-gen","ref":"followup-sql-doc-gen","sha":"974eab27d77169c7bc7205595e3702b300002865","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR generates the Java code to directly get a value for a column in `ColumnVector` without using an iterator (e.g. at lines 54-69 in the generated code example) for table cache (e.g. `dataframe.cache`). This PR improves runtime performance by eliminating data copy from column-oriented storage to `InternalRow` in a `SpecificColumnarIterator` iterator for primitive type.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded DefaultParamsWriteable, DefaultParamsReadable, DefaultParamsWriter, and DefaultParamsReader to Python to support Python-only persistence of Json-serializable parameters. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nInstantiated an estimator with Json-serializable parameters (ex. LogisticRegression), saved it using the added helper functions, and loaded it back, and compared it to the original instance to make sure it is the same. This test was both done in the Python REPL and implemented in the unit tests.\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers: there are a few excess comments that I left in the code for clarity but will remove before the code is merged to master.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-26T22:57:10Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T00:05:53Z","closed_at":"2017-08-08T00:05:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d2b7cc9fa31a487aebb5fcac82cf3ff47b467777","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4e963553983383cb1a8cb336e50b1d8105e7c7ae","head":{"label":"ajaysaini725:PythonPersistenceHelperFunctions","ref":"PythonPersistenceHelperFunctions","sha":"4e963553983383cb1a8cb336e50b1d8105e7c7ae","user":{"login":"ajaysaini725","id":9918578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTg1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9918578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725","html_url":"https://github.com/ajaysaini725","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93882782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Mzg4Mjc4Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"ajaysaini725/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajaysaini725","id":9918578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTg1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9918578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725","html_url":"https://github.com/ajaysaini725","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaysaini725/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajaysaini725/spark","description":"Mirror

The following example is taken from the ticket description:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.range(1).withColumnRenamed(\"id\", \"x\").sort(col(\"id\"))  // works\r\nspark.range(1).withColumnRenamed(\"id\", \"x\").sort($\"id\")  // works\r\nspark.range(1).withColumnRenamed(\"id\", \"x\").sort('id) // works\r\nspark.range(1).withColumnRenamed(\"id\", \"x\").sort(\"id\") // fails with:\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Cannot resolve column name \"id\" among (x);\r\n```\r\nThe above `AnalysisException` happens because the last case calls `Dataset.apply()` to convert strings into columns, which triggers attribute resolution. To make the API consistent between overloaded methods, this PR defers the resolution and constructs columns directly.","created_at":"2017-07-26T20:13:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T23:52:46Z","closed_at":"2017-07-27T23:52:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a56b0ea8ae1da256d5528effe8c3ae115989dfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18740/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18740/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18740/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0b0eea941cb850967e943719822cfab89479a025","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-21538","ref":"spark-21538","sha":"0b0eea941cb850967e943719822cfab89479a025","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

or spark.executor.instances larger then current allocated number by yarn\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor spark on yarn.\r\nRight now, when TaskSet can not run on any node or host.Which means blacklistedEverywhere is true in TaskSetManager#abortIfCompleteBlacklisted.\r\nHowever, if dynamic allocation is enabled, we should wait for yarn to allocate new nodemanager in order to execute job successfully.And we should report this information to yarn in case of assign same node which blacklisted by TaskScheduler.\r\nHow to reproduce?\r\n1、Set up a yarn cluster with  5 nodes.And assign a node1 with much larger cpu core and memory,which can let yarn launch container on this node even it is blacklisted by TaskScheduler.\r\n2、modify BlockManager#registerWithExternalShuffleServer like below\r\n\r\n    val MAX_ATTEMPTS = conf.get(config.SHUFFLE_REGISTRATION_MAX_ATTEMPTS)\r\n    val SLEEP_TIME_SECS = 5\r\n\r\n    for (i <- 1 to MAX_ATTEMPTS) {\r\n      try {\r\n        if (shuffleId.host.equals(\"node1's address\")) {\r\n             throw new Exception\r\n        }\r\n        // Synchronous and will throw an exception if we cannot connect.\r\n        shuffleClient.asInstanceOf[ExternalShuffleClient].registerWithShuffleServer(\r\n          shuffleServerId.host, shuffleServerId.port, shuffleServerId.executorId, shuffleConfig)\r\n        return\r\n      } catch {\r\n        case e: Exception if i < MAX_ATTEMPTS =>\r\n          logError(s\"Failed to connect to external shuffle server, will retry ${MAX_ATTEMPTS - i}\"\r\n            + s\" more times after waiting $SLEEP_TIME_SECS seconds...\", e)\r\n          Thread.sleep(SLEEP_TIME_SECS * 1000)\r\n        case NonFatal(e) =>\r\n          throw new SparkException(\"Unable to register with external shuffle server due to : \" +\r\n            e.getMessage, e)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n3、set shuffle service enable as true and open shuffle service for yarn.\r\nThen yarn will always launch executor on node1 but failed since shuffle service can not register success.\r\nThen job will be aborted.\r\nSo we should not abort when dynamic allocation is enable.And we should update blacklist node for yarn when blacklist everywhere.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest in production cluster and unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18282 by @rgbkrk this PR attempts to update to the current released cloudpickle and minimize the difference between Spark cloudpickle and \"stock\" cloud pickle with the goal of eventually using the stock cloud pickle.\r\n\r\nSome notable changes:\r\n* Import submodules accessed by pickled functions (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#80)\r\n* Support recursive functions inside closures (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#89, cloudpipe/cloudpickle#90)\r\n* Fix ResourceWarnings and DeprecationWarnings (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#88)\r\n* Assume modules with __file__ attribute are not dynamic (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#85)\r\n* Make cloudpickle Python 3.6 compatible (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#72)\r\n* Allow pickling of builtin methods (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#57)\r\n* Add ability to pickle dynamically created modules (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#52)\r\n* Support method descriptor (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#46)\r\n* No more pickling of closed files, was broken on Python 3 (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#32)\r\n* ** Remove non-standard __transient__check (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#110)** -- while we don't use this internally, and have no tests or documentation for its use, downstream code may use __transient__, although it has never been part of the API, if we merge this we should include a note about this in the release notes.\r\n* Support for pickling loggers (yay!) (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#96)\r\n* BUG: Fix crash when pickling dynamic class cycles. (cloudpipe/cloudpickle#102)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting PySpark unit tests + the unit tests from the cloudpickle project on their own.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-26T00:09:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T10:17:58Z","closed_at":"2017-08-22T02:20:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30ba94ae55ba039ee0bf092f29bf6d2a6b7abfd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18734/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18734/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18734/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f986c2591a9a0b6962862c5cdfc33a7d65be7eda","head":{"label":"holdenk:holden-rgbkrk-cloudpickle-upgrades","ref":"holden-rgbkrk-cloudpickle-upgrades","sha":"f986c2591a9a0b6962862c5cdfc33a7d65be7eda","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCrossValidator and TrainValidationSplit both use\r\n`models = est.fit(trainingDataset, epm) `\r\nto fit the models, where epm is `Array[ParamMap]`.\r\nEven though the training process is sequential, current implementation consumes extra driver memory for holding the trained models, which is not necessary and often leads to memory exception for both CrossValidator and TrainValidationSplit. My proposal is to optimize the training implementation, thus that used model can be collected by GC, to avoid the unnecessary OOM exceptions.\r\n\r\nE.g. when grid search space is 12, old implementation needs to hold all 12 trained models in the driver memory at the same time, while the new implementation only needs to hold 1 trained model at a time, and previous model can be cleared by GC.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit test since there's no change to logic.\r\n\r\nI've manually tested and the new implementation can allow CrossValidator and TrainValidationSplit to train on much larger models with the same max-heap-memory.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an apply() function on df.groupby(). apply() takes a pandas udf that is a transformation on `pandas.DataFrame` -> `pandas.DataFrame`. \r\n\r\nStatic schema\r\n-------------------\r\n```\r\nschema = df.schema\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(schema)\r\ndef normalize(df):\r\n    df = df.assign(v1 = (df.v1 - df.v1.mean()) / df.v1.std()\r\n    return df\r\n\r\ndf.groupBy('id').apply(normalize)\r\n```\r\nDynamic schema\r\n-----------------------\r\n**This use case is removed from the PR and we will discuss this as a follow up. See discussion https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18732#pullrequestreview-66583248**\r\n\r\nAnother example to use pd.DataFrame dtypes as output schema of the udf:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsample_df = df.filter(df.id == 1).toPandas()\r\n\r\ndef foo(df):\r\n      ret = # Some transformation on the input pd.DataFrame\r\n      return ret\r\n\r\nfoo_udf = pandas_udf(foo, foo(sample_df).dtypes)\r\n\r\ndf.groupBy('id').apply(foo_udf)\r\n```\r\nIn interactive use case, user usually have a sample pd.DataFrame to test function `foo` in their notebook. Having been able to use `foo(sample_df).dtypes` frees user from specifying the output schema of `foo`.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign doc:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now, ChunkedByteBuffer#writeFully do not slice bytes first.We observe code in java nio Util#getTemporaryDirectBuffer below:\r\n\r\n\r\n        BufferCache cache = bufferCache.get();\r\n        ByteBuffer buf = cache.get(size);\r\n        if (buf != null) {\r\n            return buf;\r\n        } else {\r\n            // No suitable buffer in the cache so we need to allocate a new\r\n            // one. To avoid the cache growing then we remove the first\r\n            // buffer from the cache and free it.\r\n            if (!cache.isEmpty()) {\r\n                buf = cache.removeFirst();\r\n

allocate at the first write call.\r\nSince we allocate new buffer, we can not control the free time of this buffer.This once cause memory issue in our production cluster.\r\nIn this patch, i supply a new api which will slice with fixed size for buffer writing.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and test in production.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-25T10:06:07Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T12:07:50Z","closed_at":"2017-08-25T15:02:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f32a23f6988379258801895f9cc395eb1349b77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18730/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18730/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18730/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a02575e3bb3f5f7f2f2d9f7a0a51a1f162c12c4d","head":{"label":"caneGuy:zhoukang/improve-chunkwrite","ref":"zhoukang/improve-chunkwrite","sha":"a02575e3bb3f5f7f2f2d9f7a0a51a1f162c12c4d","user":{"login":"caneGuy","id":26762018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzYyMDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26762018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy","html_url":"https://github.com/caneGuy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96277831,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjI3NzgzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"caneGuy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caneGuy","id":26762018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzYyMDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26762018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy","html_url":"https://github.com/caneGuy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caneGuy/spark","description":"Mirror

Currently it uses `tempDir` from `TempDirectory`, which unfortunately is never initialized since the `boforeAll()` of `ValidatorParamsSuiteHelpers` is never invoked. \r\n\r\nIn my system, it leaves
