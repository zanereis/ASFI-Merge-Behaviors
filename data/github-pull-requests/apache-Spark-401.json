root cause was the fact that this was using `System.setProperty` to set the Akka frame size, which was not actually modifying the frame size. As a result, this test would allocate much more data than necessary. The fix here is to simply use SparkConf in order to configure the frame

define the root logger's level when running the shell, defaulting\nto WARN if it's not set explicitly.\n\nOn a somewhat related change, the shell output about the \"sc\" variable\nwas changed a bit to

main changes include:\n- Renaming `SizeEstimation` to `KnownSizeEstimation`. Hopefully this new name has more information.\n- Making `estimatedSize` return `Long` instead of `Option[Long]`.\n- In `UnsaveHashedRelation`, `estimatedSize` will delegate the work to `SizeEstimator` if we have not created a `BytesToBytesMap`.\n\nSince we will put `UnsaveHashedRelation` to `BlockManager`, it is generally good to let it provide a more accurate size estimation. Also, if we do not put `BytesToBytesMap` directly into `BlockerManager`, I feel it is not really necessary to make `BytesToBytesMap` extends `KnownSizeEstimation`.\n","created_at":"2015-11-18T15:46:58Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T19:50:59Z","closed_at":"2015-11-18T19:50:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15e421cebb73b5116b25adb15fe129d277409e45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/329c72fbe7d0a49416edde5ac14cc5b9551d9e69","head":{"label":"yhuai:SPARK-11792-followup","ref":"SPARK-11792-followup","sha":"329c72fbe7d0a49416edde5ac14cc5b9551d9e69","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1429e0a2b562469146b6fa06051c85a00092e5b8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11813 \n\nI found the problem during training a large corpus. Avoid serialization of vocab in Word2Vec has 2 benefits.\n1. Performance improvement for less serialization.\n2. Increase the capacity of Word2Vec a lot. \nCurrently in the fit of word2vec, the closure mainly includes serialization of Word2Vec and 2 global table. \nthe main part of Word2vec is the vocab of size: vocab \\* 40 \\* 2 \\* 4 = 320 vocab\n2 global table: vocab \\* vectorSize \\* 8. If vectorSize = 20, that's 160 vocab.\n\nTheir sum cannot exceed Int.max due to the restriction of ByteArrayOutputStream. In any case, avoiding serialization of vocab helps decrease the size of the closure serialization, especially when vectorSize is small, thus to allow larger vocabulary.\n\nActually there's another possible fix, make local copy of fields to avoid including Word2Vec in the closure. Let me know if that's preferred.\n","created_at":"2015-11-18T09:32:41Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T21:29:37Z","closed_at":"2015-11-18T21:26:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"64267fd194c1873b6d3ecfcedbbd2c68bcfe1383","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9803/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9803/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9803/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/028138a3d11e5d38fe23d0d286c833fc0f005e5f","head":{"label":"hhbyyh:w2vVocab","ref":"w2vVocab","sha":"028138a3d11e5d38fe23d0d286c833fc0f005e5f","user":{"login":"hhbyyh","id":7981698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODE2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7981698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh","html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29568485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTU2ODQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"hhbyyh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hhbyyh","id":7981698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODE2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7981698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh","html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh/spark","description":"Mirror

patch adds an alternate to the ParquetRecordReader from the parquet-mr project\nthat is much faster for flat schemas. Instead of using the general converter mechanism\nfrom parquet-mr, this directly uses the lower level APIs from parquet-columnar and a\ncustomer RecordReader that directly assembles into UnsafeRows.\nThis is optionally disabled and only used for supported schemas.\n\nUsing a benchmark that just sums columns reading from a 1SF TPCDS store_sales table,\nI measured the rates of the entire query:\n\nFor 1 Column:\n  Before: 11.3M rows/second\n  After: 18.2M rows/second\n\nFor 2 Columns:\n  Before: 7.2M rows/second\n  After: 11.2M rows/second\n\nFor 5 Columns:\n  Before: 2.9M

discussion (SPARK-9552), we proposed a force kill in `killExecutors`. But if there is nothing to kill, it will return back with true (acknowledgement). And then, it causes the certain executor(s) (which is not eligible to kill) adding to pendingToRemove list for further actions. \n\nIn this patch, we'd like to change the return semantics. If there is nothing to kill, we will return \"false\". and therefore  all those non-eligible executors won't be added to the pendingToRemove list. \n\n@vanzin @andrewor14 As the follow up of PR#7888,

Note that in real life situations, the ordering across threads will not matter.\n\nAnother solution would be to implement a custom mockito matcher that sorts and then compares the results, but that kind of sounds like overkill to me.

PR adds a new option `spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.singleSession` for disabling multi-session support in the Thrift server.\n\nNote that this option is added as a Spark configuration (retrieved from `SparkConf`) rather than Spark SQL configuration (retrieved from `SQLConf`).
