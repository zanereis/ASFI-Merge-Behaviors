 Let KafkaIO support the deserializer API with headers\r\n\r\n  References mailing list posts:\r\n\r\n  * Original

kafka-clients API < 2.1.0 as dependency, compilation fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  required: String,byte[]\r\n  found: String,Headers,byte[]\r\n  reason: actual and formal argument lists differ in length\r\n  where T is a type-variable:\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the headers default API only landed in 2.1.0 via https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/f1f719211e5f28fe5163e65dba899b1da796a8e0#diff-a4f4aee88ce5091db576139f6c610ced\r\n\r\nI opted for `ConsumerSpEL#deserializeKey` and `ConsumerSpEL#deserializeValue` as API to ensure forward looking consistency for both `KafkaUnboundedReader` and `ReadFromKafkaDoFn` as both already depended on an instance thereof.\r\n\r\n### Not so great things\r\n\r\nUsing the SpEL for kafka-client API 2.1.0 onwards effectively turns the deserialization path into a more expensive indirection by calling the deserializer methods using reflection (2x per record, 1 x key, 1 x value):\r\n\r\n```\r\n \tat org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer.deserialize(Deserializer.java:58) <<<<<<<<<<<\r\n\tat

org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kafka.KafkaUnboundedReader.start(KafkaUnboundedReader.java:137)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd effectively this penalizes the more recent Kafka API versions in favor of the older ones. I have not measured the overhead thereof, yet.\r\n\r\n### Other avenues explored\r\n\r\nFor runtime deserialization:\r\n\r\n* Naively tried conditional compile options but the compiler cannot know which kafka-clients version could be used at runtime\r\n\r\nFor regression tests (that we don't stop passing headers in the future):\r\n\r\n* I tried Mockito and Powermock implementations on both `LocalDeserializerProvider` and the Integer and Long serializers in tests, but found the stack to be too deep and backed out of that.\r\n\r\n* Ditto for attempting to spy on `ConsumerRecord#headers()` (expect it to be called twice as much for the newer API), but again deep stack and hard to assert. Just the call is interesting because the constructor used for `ConsumerRecord` in the tests does not use the one that sets headers, presumably for client API compatibility too.\r\n\r\n* Evaluated `ExtendedSerializer`´s [wrapper](https://kafka.apache.org/0110/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/common/serialization/ExtendedDeserializer.Wrapper.html), but `ExtendedSerializer` is deprecated API and no point in bringing that in as a dependency\r\n\r\n### How the current regression test works\r\n\r\nI figured it makes sense given this feature tests deserialization and the whole test suite depends on the `Integer` (for keys) and Long (for values) ones to implement a key and value deserializer that can assert the behaviour. And herein also lies somewhat of a problem because the test case is a bit weak as I relied on stack frames (wide array of suppored client versions makes anything else super complex) to infer the caller of the `deserialize` method, but unfortunately only class and method name context is provide and no arguments size of 3 or even types on those to assert on.\r\n\r\nKafka client API 1.0.0 :\r\n\r\n```\r\nFrame 0: java.lang.Thread.getStackTrace\r\nFrame 1: org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kafka.KafkaIOTest$IntegerDeserializerWithHeadersAssertor#deserialize\r\nFrame 2: org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kafka.KafkaIOTest$IntegerDeserializerWithHeadersAssertor#deserialize\r\nFrame 3: org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kafka.ConsumerSpEL#deserializeKey\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor clients before 2.1.0, frame 3 is `ConsumerSpEL#deserializeKey`, meaning it was called directly and not via a default or actual implementation on `Deserializer`. Frames 1 and 2 being equal is because of the `super.deserialize` call.\r\n\r\nKafka client API 2.1.0+ :\r\n```\r\nFrame 0: java.lang.Thread.getStackTrace\r\nFrame 1: org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kafka.KafkaIOTest$IntegerDeserializerWithHeadersAssertor#deserialize\r\nFrame 2: org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kafka.KafkaIOTest$IntegerDeserializerWithHeadersAssertor#deserialize\r\nFrame 3: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer#deserialize\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor clients 2.1.0 and beyond, frame 3 is `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer#deserialize`. This is true for the bundled deserializers used in the tests because they delegate the call to the implementation on `Deserializer`. In practice this may refer to an actual override implementation.\r\n\r\n### Feedback items for me\r\n\r\n* Any alternatives for the SpEL evaluation for this hot path API? `consumer.seekToEnd` and `consumer.assign` are once off / periodic APIs and not called as often as twice per record.\r\n* Ideas for a better way to test for regressions?\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n* Would it make sense to consider raising the minimum supported client API in order to \r\n* If this implementation (and very likely iterations thereof :-)), would support for the same API on serialization be appreciated as well?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

BigQuerySource to use a different project to the execution project\r\nfor the temporary dataset.\r\n\r\nThere are some uses cases that require temporary datasets created when using beam.io.BigQuerySource to be in a different GCP project (e.g service account permissions, billing).\r\n\r\nWe could make the project where temporary datasets configurable, so that the temp dataset is created in a user specified project. Example:\r\n```\r\npipeline = p | \"Read from BQ source\" >> beam.io.Read(beam.io.BigQuerySource(\r\n    query=q,\r\n    use_standard_sql=True,\r\n    project='dataflow-project',\r\n    temp_dataset_project='bigquery-project'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `temp_dataset_project` option when creating the `beam.io.BigQuerySource`, which defaults to the execution project.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the setup.py command for creating python worker packages is\r\n\r\n`python setup.py sdist --dist-dir <tmp_dir>`\r\n\r\nThis writes the <package-name>.tar.gz file to the tmp directory, but also automatically writes a <package-name>.egg-info directory to the current directory.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it to run as\r\n\r\n`python setup.py egg_info --egg-base <tmp_dir> sdist --dist-dir <tmp_dir>`\r\n\r\nSo both files are only written to the tmp directory. This avoids creating clutter in the current directory, and also allows the pipeline to be set up in an environment (like Appengine) which only allows writing to /tmp.\r\n\r\nThe egg-info directory is not used to get the package to the workers. Only the tar.gz is. So moving it doesn't change anything about that process.\r\n\r\nExample of running both commands: https://gist.github.com/ohnorobo/ce06fc302598202b2a9b0997dd48fc0d\r\n\r\nI'm unsure how best to test this change, since the [current test](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/portability/stager_test.py#L274) mocks out the setup.py call entirely.\r\n\r\n(This is my first contribution. Please let me know if I need to change something.)\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

remove aggregation functions from `SqlOperatorMappingTable.java`.\r\n\r\nCurrently ZetaSQL support aggregation functions that are either\r\n- implemented as UDAF operator in the ZetaSQL module (currently on `string_agg`), or\r\n- implemented in `org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.sql.impl.transform.BeamBuiltinAggregations`\r\n\r\nTo keep a single source of truth of all the supported aggregation functions, I removed the aggregation functions list from `SqlOperatorMappingTable.java` (a duplicate copy of the above two cases).\r\n\r\nThis way we can also avoid using the predefined aggregation operators from Calcite `SqlStdOperatorTable`, which has its own way of inferring whether an aggregation result is nullable. Their inferring methods are incorrect in my opinion. For example, this is the [code pointer](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/88d18185e6177c9df587bdd23dd4049f59adc2e4/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/sql/type/ReturnTypes.java#L846-L847) to how they infer the the result of `SUM`.\r\n\r\nr: @amaliujia @apilloud \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR adds support for `beam:logical_type:micros_instant:v1` in Python and Java. It also adds logic for translating logical types which do not use the argument to portable Beam schemas.\r\n\r\nIn Python, `micros_instant:v1` is the default mapping for the microsecond-precision `beam.utils.timestamp.Timestamp` type when inferring a schema.\r\n\r\nThe change is tested via unit tests in Python and Java, as well as a new entry in `standard_coders_test.yaml`.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit

problem is that read has already been merged to the 2.24 RC and in there snowflake.py is in apache_beam.io.external while after write merge into 2.25 it was moved to apache_beam.io, as this is the preferred place to put cross-language ios.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 possibilities:\r\n- Move snowflake.py back to apache_beam.io.external\r\n- Make a redirect file with imports from apache_beam.io.snowflake and add a deprecation warning like in kafka.py\r\n\r\nThere are also changes to versions in CHANGES.md - cross-language Read and write dispositions were added in 2.24, not

PR:\r\n- implement the setup_only contract in python sdk container boot.go, which installs dependencies in advance.\r\n- add sdk_container_builder class which builds the image with local docker by default, and the sdk_container_cloud_builder which leverages the google cloud build service for building the image in a serverless way.\r\n\r\nthe skipped installation steps will lead to faster container startup in dataflow python pipelines.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
