change modifies the behavior of the delegation token code when running\r\non YARN, so that the driver controls the renewal, in both client and cluster\r\nmode. For that, a few different things were changed:\r\n\r\n* The AM code only runs code that needs DTs when DTs are available.\r\n\r\nIn a way, this restores the AM behavior to what it was pre-SPARK-23361, but\r\nkeeping the fix added in that bug. Basically, all the AM code is run in a\r\n\"UGI.doAs()\" block; but code that needs to talk to HDFS (basically the\r\ndistributed cache handling code) was delayed to the point where the driver\r\nis up and running, and thus when valid delegation tokens are available.\r\n\r\n* SparkSubmit / ApplicationMaster now handle user login, not the token manager.\r\n\r\nThe previous AM code was relying on the token manager to keep the user\r\nlogged in when keytabs are used. This required some odd APIs in the token\r\nmanager and the AM so that the right UGI was exposed and used in the right\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the logged in user is handled separately from the token\r\nmanager, so the API was cleaned up, and, as explained above, the whole AM\r\nruns under the logged in user, which also helps with simplifying some more code.\r\n\r\n* Distributed cache configs are sent separately to the AM.\r\n\r\nBecause of the delayed initialization of the cached resources in the AM, it\r\nbecame easier to write the cache config to a separate properties file instead\r\nof bundling it with the rest of the Spark config. This also avoids having\r\nto modify the SparkConf to hide things from the UI.\r\n\r\n* Finally, the AM doesn't manage the token manager anymore.\r\n\r\nThe above changes allow the token manager to be completely handled by the\r\ndriver's scheduler backend code also in YARN mode (whether client or cluster),\r\nmaking it similar to other RMs. To maintain the fix added in SPARK-23361 also\r\nin client mode, the AM now sends an extra message to the driver on initialization\r\nto fetch delegation tokens; and although it might not really be needed, the\r\ndriver also keeps the running AM updated when new tokens are created.\r\n\r\nTested in a kerberized cluster with the same tests used to validate SPARK-23361,\r\nin both client and cluster mode. Also tested with a non-kerberized

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter [recent changes](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/11e5f1bcd49eec8ab4225d6e68a051b5c6a21cb2) to CSV parsing to return partial results for bad CSV records, queries of wide CSV tables slowed considerably. That recent change resulted in every row being recreated, even when the associated input record had no parsing issues and the user specified no corrupt record field in his/her schema.\r\n\r\nThe change to FailureSafeParser.scala also impacted queries against wide JSON tables as well.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose that a row should be recreated only if columns need to be shifted due to the existence of a corrupt column field in the user-supplied schema. Otherwise, the code should use the row as-is (For CSV input, it will have values for the columns that could be converted, and also null values for columns that could not be converted).\r\n\r\nSee benchmarks below. The CSV benchmark for 1000 columns went from 120144 ms to 89069 ms, a savings of 25% (this only brings the cost down to baseline levels. Again, see benchmarks below).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the JSON benchmark for 1000 columns (added in this PR) went from 109621 ms to 80871 ms, also a savings of 25%.\r\n\r\nStill, partial results functionality is preserved:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nbash-3.2$ cat test2.csv \r\n\"hello\",1999-08-01,\"last\"\r\n\"there\",\"bad date\",\"field\"\r\n\"again\",\"2017-11-22\",\"in file\"\r\nbash-3.2$

values(NaN and -0.0), so the sorter doesn't have to handle it.\r\n\r\nHowever, for consistency and future-proof, this PR proposes to normalize `-0.0` in the prefix comparator, so that it's same with the normal ordering. Note that prefix comparator handles NaN as well.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bug fix, but a safe guard.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded new internal flag for `JacksonParser` - `skipInputWithoutTokens` to control parser's behavior when its input does **not** contain any valid JSON tokens. The flag is set to `true` for JSON datasource and enables the same behavior of the datasource as it has in Spark 2.4 and earlier. The flag is set to `false` for JSON functions like `from_json`. \r\n\r\nThe flag impacts only on handling bad JSON records without valid JSON tokens on the root level:\r\n- JSON datasource skips such records in the `PERMISSIVE`, `FAILFAST` and `DROPMALFORMED` modes. JSON datasource does not support `ArrayType` and `MapType` as the root type. For `StructType`, bad records are skipped and excluded from results.\r\n- `from_json`:\r\n  - in the `FAILFAST` mode, throws `SparkException` for all supported root types - `StructType`, `ArrayType` and `MapType`\r\n  - in the `PERMISSIVE` mode return a `Row` with `null`s for all fields if specified root type is `StructType` (bad record string is placed to the corrupt column if it is specified), and `null` for `ArrayType` and `MapType`.\r\n  - the `DROPMALFORMED` mode is not supported.\r\n\r\n**Summary**: The PR changes behavior of JSON datasource in the `PERMISSIVE` and `FAILFAST` modes by skipping bad records without valid JSON tokens.\r\n   \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by `JsonSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-15T16:14:24Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:36:08Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T05:05:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15a5d213e633d49b93fa031410a4c4021f754547","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23325/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23325/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23325/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ea4f3122fef574ad4235828b8b9a4df15b88604","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:json-ignore-no-tokens","ref":"json-ignore-no-tokens","sha":"4ea4f3122fef574ad4235828b8b9a4df15b88604","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDue to [KAFKA-7703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7703), Kafka may return an earliest offset when we are request a latest offset. This will cause Spark to reprocess data.\r\n\r\nAs per suggestion in KAFKA-7703, we put a position call between poll and seekToEnd to block the fetch request triggered by `poll` before calling `seekToEnd`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to avoid other unknown issues, we also use the previous known offsets to audit the latest offsets returned by Kafka. If we find some incorrect offsets (a latest offset is less than an offset in `knownOffsets`), we will retry at most `maxOffsetFetchAttempts` times.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins","created_at":"2018-12-14T23:19:38Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T15:32:23Z","closed_at":"2018-12-21T18:44:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71e82cf12755310ea08b6bf40493d56e8735e3a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23324/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23324/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23324/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fb1f698395d16e8a2aabe7441d628526160eca46","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-26267","ref":"SPARK-26267","sha":"fb1f698395d16e8a2aabe7441d628526160eca46","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

It'd be easier to understand the life cycle if we move the creation of it out.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is a simple code move and should be covered by existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `ReplaceExceptWithFilter` we do not consider properly the case in which the condition returns NULL. Indeed, in that case, since negating NULL still returns NULL, so it is not true the assumption that negating the condition returns all the rows which didn't satisfy it, rows returning NULL may not be returned. This happens when constraints inferred by `InferFiltersFromConstraints` are not enough, as it happens with `OR` conditions.\r\n\r\nThe rule had also problems with non-deterministic conditions: in such a scenario, this rule would change the probability of the output.\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes these problem by:\r\n - returning False for the condition when it is Null (in this way we do return all the rows which didn't satisfy it);\r\n - avoiding any transformation when the condition is non-deterministic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf the input parameter 'threshold' to the function approxSimilarityJoin is not a float, we would get an exception.  The fix is to convert the 'threshold' into a float before calling the java implementation method.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case.  Without this fix, the test will throw an exception as reported in the JIRA. With the fix, the test passes.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we infer the schema for scala/java decimals, we return as data type the `SYSTEM_DEFAULT` implementation, ie. the decimal type with precision 38 and scale 18. But this is not right, as we know nothing about the right precision and scale and these values can be not enough to store the data. This problem arises in particular with UDF, where we cast all the input of type `DecimalType` to a `DecimalType(38, 18)`: in case this is not enough, null is returned as input for the UDF.\r\n\r\nThe PR defines a custom handling for casting to the expected data types for ScalaUDF: the decimal precision and scale is picked from the input, so no casting to different and maybe wrong percision and scale happens.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded UTs\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-13T11:43:14Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T06:22:23Z","closed_at":"2018-12-20T06:22:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d99f298897e65bd9031563a8b7072d999895fbb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50b1499c50809bfdbb2b419ff54738cf7837b1a3","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-26308","ref":"SPARK-26308","sha":"50b1499c50809bfdbb2b419ff54738cf7837b1a3","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n[SPARK-25108](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25108) made `Dataset#show` care about wide characters when padding them. That is useful for humans to read a result of `Dataset#show`. On the other hand, that makes it impossible for programs to parse a result of `Dataset#show` because each cell's length can be different from its header's length. My company develops and manages a Jupyter/Apache Zeppelin-like visualization tool named [OASIS](https://databricks.com/session/oasis-collaborative-data-analysis-platform-using-apache-spark). On this application, a result of `Dataset#show` on a Scala or Python process is parsed to visualize it as an HTML table format as follows: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1092\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-12-13 at

`spark.sql.dataset.show.handleFullWidthCharacters` property for `Dataset#show` to control whether wide characters are cared/handled or not.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was

change exposes the executors' proscfs metrics that were introduced in SPARK-24958 to Metrics system. To do this a new metric source is defined and a new config is also added. Using the configs user can choose whether they want to see procfs metrics through Metrics system. To avoid overhead a cache is added in ProsfsMtericsGetter to avoid computing metrics if they have beean computed in the past one second.\r\n\r\nThis was tested manually and I verified that procfs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe optimizer rule `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.ReorderJoin` performs join reordering on inner joins. This was introduced from SPARK-12032 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10073) in 2015-12.\r\n\r\nAfter it had reordered the joins, though, it didn't check whether or not the output attribute order is still the same as before. Thus, it's possible to have a mismatch between the reordered output attributes order vs the schema that a DataFrame thinks it has.\r\nThe same problem exists in the CBO version of join reordering (`CostBasedJoinReorder`) too.\r\n\r\nThis can be demonstrated with the example:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"create table table_a (x int, y int) using parquet\")\r\nspark.sql(\"create table table_b (i int, j int) using parquet\")\r\nspark.sql(\"create table table_c (a int, b int) using parquet\")\r\nval df = spark.sql(\"\"\"\r\n  with df1 as (select * from table_a cross join table_b)\r\n  select * from df1 join table_c on a = x and b = i\r\n\"\"\")\r\n```\r\nhere's what the DataFrame thinks:\r\n```\r\nscala> df.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- x: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- y: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- i: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- j: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- a: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\nhere's what the optimized plan thinks, after join reordering:\r\n```\r\nscala> df.queryExecution.optimizedPlan.output.foreach(a => println(s\"|-- ${a.name}: ${a.dataType.typeName}\"))\r\n|-- x: integer\r\n|-- y: integer\r\n|-- a: integer\r\n|-- b: integer\r\n|-- i: integer\r\n|-- j: integer\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we exclude the `ReorderJoin` rule (using Spark 2.4's optimizer rule exclusion feature), it's back to normal:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.optimizer.excludedRules\", \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.ReorderJoin\")\r\n\r\nscala> val df = spark.sql(\"with df1 as (select * from table_a cross join table_b) select * from df1 join table_c on a = x and b = i\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [x: int, y: int ... 4 more fields]\r\n\r\nscala> df.queryExecution.optimizedPlan.output.foreach(a => println(s\"|-- ${a.name}: ${a.dataType.typeName}\"))\r\n|-- x: integer\r\n|-- y: integer\r\n|-- i: integer\r\n|-- j: integer\r\n|-- a: integer\r\n|-- b: integer\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this output attribute ordering problem leads to data corruption, and can manifest itself in various symptoms:\r\n* Silently corrupting data, if the reordered columns happen to either have matching types or have sufficiently-compatible types (e.g. all fixed length primitive types are considered as \"sufficiently compatible\" in an `UnsafeRow`), then only the resulting data is going to be wrong but it might not trigger any alarms immediately. Or\r\n* Weird Java-level exceptions like `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException`, or even SIGSEGVs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test in `JoinReorderSuite` and new end-to-end test in `JoinSuite`.\r\nAlso made `JoinReorderSuite` and `StarJoinReorderSuite` assert more strongly on maintaining output attribute

there is code scattered in a bunch of places to do different\r\nthings related to HTTP security, such as access control, setting\r\nsecurity-related headers, and filtering out bad content. This makes it\r\nreally easy to miss these things when writing new UI code.\r\n\r\nThis change creates a new filter that does all of those things, and\r\nmakes sure that all servlet handlers that are attached to the UI get\r\nthe new filter and any user-defined filters consistently. The extent\r\nof the actual features should be the same as before.\r\n\r\nThe new filter is added at the end of the filter chain, because authentication\r\nis done by custom filters and thus needs to happen first. This means that\r\ncustom filters see unfiltered HTTP requests - which is actually the current\r\nbehavior anyway.\r\n\r\nAs a side-effect of some of the code refactoring, handlers added after\r\nthe

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR contains benchmarks for `In` and `InSet` expressions. They cover literals of different data types and will help us to decide where to integrate the switch-based logic for bytes/shorts/ints.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in [PR-23171](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23171), one potential approach is to convert `In` to `InSet` if all elements are literals independently of data types and the number of elements. According to the results of this PR, we might want to keep the threshold for the number of elements. The if-else approach approach might be faster for some data types on a small number of elements (structs? arrays? small decimals?).\r\n\r\n### byte / short / int / long\r\n\r\nUnless the number of items is really big, `InSet` is slower than `In` because of autoboxing . \r\n\r\nInterestingly, `In` scales worse on bytes/shorts than on ints/longs. For example, `InSet` starts to match the performance on around 50 bytes/shorts while this does not happen on the same number of ints/longs. This is a bit strange as shorts/bytes (e.g., `(byte) 1`, `(short) 2`) are represented as ints in the bytecode.\r\n\r\n### float / double\r\n\r\nUse cases on floats/doubles also suffer from autoboxing. Therefore, `In` outperforms `InSet` on 10 elements.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to shorts/bytes, `In` scales worse on floats/doubles than on ints/longs because the equality condition is more complicated (e.g., `java.lang.Float.isNaN(filter_valueArg_0) && java.lang.Float.isNaN(9.0F)) || filter_valueArg_0 == 9.0F`). \r\n\r\n### decimal\r\n\r\nThe reason why we have separate benchmarks for small and large decimals is that Spark might use longs to represent decimals in some cases.\r\n\r\nIf this optimization happens, then `equals` will be nothing else as comparing longs. If this does not happen, Spark will create an instance of `scala.BigDecimal` and use it for comparisons. The latter is more expensive.\r\n\r\n`Decimal$hashCode` will always use `scala.BigDecimal$hashCode` even if the number is small enough to fit into a long variable. As a consequence, we see that use cases on small decimals are faster with `In` as they are using long comparisons under the hood. Large decimal values are always faster with `InSet`.\r\n\r\n### string\r\n\r\n`UTF8String$equals` is not cheap. Therefore, `In` does not really outperform `InSet` as in previous use cases.\r\n\r\n### timestamp / date\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, timestamp/date values will be represented as long/int values. So, `In` allows us to avoid autoboxing.\r\n\r\n### array\r\n\r\nArrays are working as expected. `In` is faster on 5 elements while `InSet` is faster on 15 elements. The benchmarks are using `UnsafeArrayData`. \r\n\r\n### struct\r\n\r\n`InSet` is always faster than `In` for structs. These benchmarks use `GenericInternalRow`.","created_at":"2018-12-11T19:09:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T19:47:07Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T14:28:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b3658a7657d844a2ef60cde7441fc5f22a9ebf6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23291/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23291/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23291/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/713f3dbcfafbdb52d05c611259f8d7bee41f7393","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-26203","ref":"spark-26203","sha":"713f3dbcfafbdb52d05c611259f8d7bee41f7393","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `BytesToBytesMap.MapIterator.advanceToNextPage`, We will first lock this `MapIterator` and then `TaskMemoryManager` when going to free a memory page by calling `freePage`. At the same time, it is possibly that another memory consumer first locks `TaskMemoryManager` and then this `MapIterator` when it acquires memory and causes spilling on this `MapIterator`.\r\n\r\nSo it ends with the `MapIterator` object holds lock to the `MapIterator` object and waits for lock on `TaskMemoryManager`, and the other consumer holds lock to `TaskMemoryManager` and waits for lock on the `MapIterator` object.\r\n\r\nTo avoid deadlock here, this patch proposes to keep reference to the page to free and free it after releasing the lock of `MapIterator`.\r\n\r\nThis backports the fix to branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n Added test and manually test by running the test 100 times to make sure there is no deadlock.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-11T14:08:10Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:22:13Z","closed_at":"2018-12-12T00:46:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8843a8d9fafe5d02772c313fb8e22a603a9729d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d520a97a584bd4f17c8ff0f62d18794a214fa38f","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-26265-2.4","ref":"SPARK-26265-2.4","sha":"d520a97a584bd4f17c8ff0f62d18794a214fa38f","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have seen many cases when users make several subsequent calls to `withColumn` on a Dataset. This leads now to the generation of a lot of `Project` nodes on the top of the plan, with serious problem which can lead also to `StackOverflowException`s.\r\n\r\nThe PR improves the doc of `withColumn`, in order to advise the user to avoid this pattern and do something different, ie. a single select with all the column he/she needs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRegarding the performance issue of SPARK-26155, it reports the issue on TPC-DS. I think it is better to add a benchmark for `LongToUnsafeRowMap` which is the root cause of performance regression.\r\n\r\nIt can be easier to show performance difference between different metric

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroducing shared polled ByteBuf allocators. \r\nThis feature can be enabled via the \"spark.network.sharedByteBufAllocators.enabled\" configuration. \r\n\r\nWhen it is on then only two pooled ByteBuf allocators are created: \r\n- one for transport servers where caching is allowed and\r\n- one for transport clients where caching is disabled\r\n\r\nThis way the cache allowance remains as before. \r\nBoth shareable pools are created with numCores parameter set to 0 (which defaults to the available processors) as conf.serverThreads() and conf.clientThreads() are module dependant and the lazy creation of this allocators would lead to unpredicted behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen \"spark.network.sharedByteBufAllocators.enabled\" is false then a new allocator is created for every transport client and server separately as was before this PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs the description in [SPARK-26327](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26327), `postDriverMetricUpdates` was called on wrong place cause this bug, fix this by split the initializing of `selectedPartitions` and metrics updating logic. Add the updating logic in `inputRDD` initializing which can take effect in both code generation node and normal node. Also rename `metadataTime` to `fileListingTime` for clearer meaning.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test case in `SQLMetricsSuite`.\r\nManual test:\r\n\r\n|         | Before | After

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove the behavior of sql text splitting for the spark-sql command line.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the spark-sql command line does not split the sql text correctly, for example, the `;` in double quotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/mvn -Phive-thriftserver -DskipTests package\r\n$ bin/spark-sql\r\n> select \"^;^\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected result is `^;^` . However, Spark master will split the SQL by `;`. As as result, `select \"^` is not a valid SQL.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select \"\\\";\";\r\n\";\r\nspark-sql> select \"\\';\";\r\n';\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnit Tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-thriftserver\r\n> project hive-thriftserver\r\n> testOnly *SparkSQLCLIDriverSuite\r\n> project catalyst\r\n> testOnly *StringUtilsSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\nPolish the code on SignalHandler. However, it should be another PR.\r\n\r\n+ [x] Fix the failed tests.\r\n+ [x] Polish StringUtils.split and add more unit tests\r\n+ [x] Add scaladoc\r\n+ [x] Handling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen Kafka delegation token obtained, SCRAM `sasl.mechanism` has to be configured for authentication. This can be configured on the related source/sink which is inconvenient from user perspective. Such granularity is not required and this configuration can be implemented with one central parameter.\r\n\r\nIn this PR `spark.kafka.sasl.token.mechanism` added to configure this centrally (default: `SCRAM-SHA-512`).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests + on

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `BytesToBytesMap.MapIterator.advanceToNextPage`, We will first lock this `MapIterator` and then `TaskMemoryManager` when going to free a memory page by calling `freePage`. At the same time, it is possibly that another memory consumer first locks `TaskMemoryManager` and then this `MapIterator` when it acquires memory and causes spilling on this `MapIterator`.\r\n\r\nSo it ends with the `MapIterator` object holds lock to the `MapIterator` object and waits for lock on `TaskMemoryManager`, and the other consumer holds lock to `TaskMemoryManager` and waits for lock on the `MapIterator` object.\r\n\r\nTo avoid deadlock here, this patch proposes to keep reference to the page to free and free it after releasing the lock of `MapIterator`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test and manually test by running the test 100 times to make sure there is no deadlock.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-10T08:16:05Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:22:11Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T13:13:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f20fea24f2f9295ae2dbadbc8274fd6d35b6542","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08490838470d4f8e291d2d94ebadf32576a60205","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-26265","ref":"SPARK-26265","sha":"08490838470d4f8e291d2d94ebadf32576a60205","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23208/files#r239684490 , we should put `newScanBuilder` in read related mix-in traits like `SupportsBatchRead`, to support write-only table.\r\n\r\nIn the `Append` operator, we should skip schema validation if not necessary. In the future we would introduce a capability API, so that data source can tell Spark that it doesn't want to do validation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23239 to 2.4\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23043\r\n\r\nThere are 4 places we need to deal with NaN and -0.0:\r\n1. comparison expressions. `-0.0` and `0.0` should be treated as same. Different NaNs should be treated as same.\r\n2. Join keys. `-0.0` and `0.0` should be treated as same. Different NaNs should be treated as same.\r\n3. grouping keys. `-0.0` and `0.0` should be assigned to the same group. Different NaNs should be assigned to the same group.\r\n4. window partition keys. `-0.0` and `0.0` should be treated as same. Different NaNs should be treated as same.\r\n\r\nThe case 1 is OK. Our comparison already handles NaN and -0.0, and for struct/array/map, we will recursively compare the fields/elements.\r\n\r\nCase 2, 3 and 4 are problematic, as they compare `UnsafeRow` binary directly, and different NaNs have different binary representation, and the same thing happens for -0.0 and 0.0.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, a simple solution is: normalize float/double when building unsafe data (`UnsafeRow`, `UnsafeArrayData`, `UnsafeMapData`). Then we don't need to worry about it anymore.\r\n\r\nFollowing this direction, this PR moves the handling of NaN and -0.0 from `Platform` to `UnsafeWriter`, so that places like `UnsafeRow.setFloat` will not handle them, which reduces the perf overhead. It's also easier to add comments explaining why we do it in `UnsafeWriter`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add ML events to Instrumentation, and use it in Pipeline so that other developers can track and add some actions for them.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nML events (like SQL events) can be quite useful when people want to track and make some actions for corresponding ML operations. For instance, I have been working on integrating \r\nApache Spark with [Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/QuickStart.html). With some custom changes with this PR, I can visualise ML pipeline as below:\r\n\r\n![spark_ml_streaming_lineage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/49682779-394bca80-faf5-11e8-85b8-5fae28b784b3.png)\r\n\r\nI would like to note that we can also interact this with other SQL/Streaming events in Apache Spark. For instance, where the input `Dataset` is originated. For instance, with current Apache Spark, I can visualise SQL operations as below:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-12-10 at 9 41 36 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/49706269-d9bdfe00-fc5f-11e8-943a-3309d1856ba5.png)\r\n\r\nI think we can combine those existing lineages together to easily understand where the data comes and goes. Currently, ML side is a hole so the lineages can't be connected for the current Apache Spark ..\r\n\r\nI think it's not to mention how useful it is to track the SQL/Streaming operations. I would like to propose ML events as well (as lowest stability `@Unstable` APIs for now - no guarantee about stability).\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Event Class Implementation\r\n\r\n**`mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/events.scala`**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@Unstable\r\ncase class ...StartEvent(caller, input)\r\n@Unstable\r\ncase class ...EndEvent(caller, output)\r\n\r\ntrait MLEvents {\r\n  // Wrappers to send events:\r\n  // def with...Event(body) = {\r\n  //   body()\r\n  //   SparkContext.getOrCreate().listenerBus.post(event)\r\n  // }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis trait is used by `Instrumentation`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass Instrumentation ... with MLEvents {\r\n```\r\n\r\nand used as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ninstrumented { instr =>\r\n  instr.with...Event(...) {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sending Side Implemnetation\r\n\r\nThis way mimics both:\r\n\r\n**1. Catalog events (see `org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/catalog/events.scala`)**\r\n\r\n- This allows a Catalog specific listener to be added `ExternalCatalogEventListener` \r\n\r\n- It's implemented in a way of wrapping whole `ExternalCatalog` named `ExternalCatalogWithListener`\r\nwhich delegates the operations to `ExternalCatalog`\r\n\r\nThis is not quite possible in this case because most of instances (like `Pipeline`) will be directly created by users in most of cases. We might be able to do that via extending `ListenerBus` for all possible instances but IMHO it's too invasive. Also, exposing another ML specific listener sounds a bit too much at this stage. Therefore, I simply borrowed file name and structures here\r\n\r\n**2. SQL execution events (see `org/apache/spark/sql/execution/SQLExecution.scala`)**\r\n\r\n- Add an object that wraps a body to send events\r\n\r\nCurrent apporach is rather close to this. It has a `with...` wrapper to send events. I borrowed this approach to be consistent.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIt needs a custom implementation for a query listener. For instance,\r\n\r\nwith the custom listener below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass CustomMLListener extends SparkListener\r\n  def onOtherEvents(e) = e match {\r\n    case e: MLEvent => // do something\r\n    case _ => // pass\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two (existing) ways to use this.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sparkContext.addSparkListener(new CustomMLListener)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspark-submit ...\\\r\n  --conf spark.extraListeners=CustomMLListener\\\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also similar with other existing implementation in SQL side.\r\n\r\n## Target users\r\n\r\n1. At least, I can see some interests going on outside.\r\n\r\n    - SQL Listener\r\n      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46409339/spark-listener-to-an-sql-query\r\n      - http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/spark-sql-Custom-Query-Execution-listener-via-conf-properties-td30979.html\r\n\r\n    - Streaming Query Listener\r\n      - https://jhui.github.io/2017/01/15/Apache-Spark-Streaming/\r\n      -  http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Structured-Streaming-with-Watermark-td25413.html#a25416\r\n\r\n2. Apache Atlas and Spark users. The plugin mirror is exposed at [spark-atlas-connector](https://github.com/hortonworks-spark/spark-atlas-connector) so that anyone could do something about lineage and governance in Atlas.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unit tests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add ML events so that other developers can track and add some actions for them.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to send some ML events like SQL. This is quite useful when people want to track and make some actions for corresponding ML operations. For instance, I have been working on integrating \r\nApache Spark with [Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/QuickStart.html). With some custom changes with this PR, I can visualise ML pipeline as below:\r\n\r\n![spark_ml_streaming_lineage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/49682779-394bca80-faf5-11e8-85b8-5fae28b784b3.png)\r\n\r\nI think not to mention how useful it is to track the SQL operations. Likewise, I would like to propose ML events as well (as lowest stability `@Unstable` APIs for now - no guarantee about stability).\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Sends event (but not expose ML specific listener)\r\n\r\nIn `events.scala`, it adds:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@Unstable\r\ncase class ...StartEvent(caller, input)\r\n@Unstable\r\ncase class ...EndEvent(caller, output)\r\n\r\nobject MLEvents {\r\n  // Wrappers to send events:\r\n  // def with...Event(body) = {\r\n  //   body()\r\n  //   SparkContext.getOrCreate().listenerBus.post(event)\r\n  // }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way mimics both:\r\n\r\n**1. Catalog events (see `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.events.scala`)**\r\n\r\n- This allows a Catalog specific listener to be added `ExternalCatalogEventListener` \r\n\r\n- It's implemented in a way of wrapping whole `ExternalCatalog` named `ExternalCatalogWithListener`\r\nwhich delegates the operations to `ExternalCatalog`\r\n\r\nThis is not quite possible in this case because most of instances (like `Pipeline`) will be directly created in most of cases. We might be able to do that via extending `ListenerBus` for all possible instances but IMHO it's too invasive. Also, exposing another ML specific listener sounds a bit too much at this stage. Therefore, I simply borrowed file name and structures here\r\n\r\n**2. SQL execution events (see `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SQLExecution.scala`)**\r\n\r\n- Add an object that wraps a body to send events\r\n\r\nCurrent apporach is rather close to this. It has a `with...` wrapper to send events. I borrowed this approach to be consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Add `...Impl` methods to wrap each to send events\r\n\r\n**1. `mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/util/ReadWrite.scala`**\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- def save(...) = { saveImpl(...) }\r\n+ def save(...) = MLEvents.withSaveInstanceEvent { saveImpl(...) }\r\n  def saveImpl(...): Unit = ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n  Note that `saveImpl` was already implemented unlike other instances below.\r\n\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- def load(...): T\r\n+ def load(...): T = MLEvents.withLoadInstanceEvent { loadImple(...) }\r\n+ def loadImpl(...): T\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2. `mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/Estimator.scala`**\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- def fit(...): Model\r\n+ def fit(...): Model = MLEvents.withFitEvent { fitImpl(...) }\r\n+ def fitImpl(...): Model\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3. `mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/Transformer.scala`**\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- def transform(...): DataFrame\r\n+ def transform(...): DataFrame = MLEvents.withTransformEvent { transformImpl(...) }\r\n+ def transformImpl(...): DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach follows the existing way as below in ML:\r\n\r\n**1. `transform` and `transformImpl`**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9b1f6c8bab5401258c653d4e2efb50e97c6d282f/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/Predictor.scala#L202-L213\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9b1f6c8bab5401258c653d4e2efb50e97c6d282f/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/regression/DecisionTreeRegressor.scala#L191-L196\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9b1f6c8bab5401258c653d4e2efb50e97c6d282f/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/regression/GeneralizedLinearRegression.scala#L1037-L1042\r\n\r\n**2. `save` and `saveImpl`**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9b1f6c8bab5401258c653d4e2efb50e97c6d282f/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/util/ReadWrite.scala#L166-L176\r\n\r\nInherited ones are intentionally omitted here for simplicity. They are inherited and implemented at multiple places.\r\n\r\n## Backward Compatibility\r\n\r\n_This keeps both source and binary backward compatibility_. I was thinking enforcing `...Impl` by leaving it abstract methods to force to implement but just decided to leave a body that throws `UnsupportedOperationException` so that we can keep full source and binary compatibilities.\r\n\r\n- For user-faced API perspective, _there's no difference_. `...Impl` methods are protected and not visible to end users.\r\n\r\n- For developer API perspective, if some developers want to `...` methods instead of `...Impl`, that's still fine. It only does not handle events. If developers want to handle events from their custom implementation, they should implement `...Impl`. Of course, it is encouraged to implement `...Impl`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unit tests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes adding a new configuration on SHS: custom executor log URL pattern. This will enable end users to replace executor logs to other than RM provide, like external log service, which enables to serve executor logs when NodeManager becomes unavailable in case of YARN.\r\n\r\nEnd users can build their own of custom executor log URLs with pre-defined patterns which would be vary on each resource manager. This patch adds some patterns to YARN resource manager. (For others, there's even no executor log url available so cannot define patterns as well.)\r\n\r\nPlease refer the doc change as well as added UTs in this patch to see how to set up the feature.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT, as well as manual test with YARN

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr targeted to define reserved/non-reserved keywords for Spark SQL based on the ANSI SQL standards and the other database-like systems (e.g., PostgreSQL). We assume that they basically follow the ANSI SQL-2011 standard, but it is slightly different between each other. Therefore, this pr documented all the keywords in `docs/sql-reserved-and-non-reserved-key-words.md`.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This pr only added a small set of keywords as reserved ones and these keywords are reserved in all the ANSI SQL standards (SQL-92, SQL-99, SQL-2003, SQL-2008, SQL-2011, and SQL-2016) and PostgreSQL. This is because there is room to discuss which keyword should be reserved or not, .e.g., interval units (day, hour, minute, second, ...) are reserved in the ANSI SQL standards though, they are not reserved in PostgreSQL. Therefore, we need more researches about the other database-like systems (e.g., Oracle Databases, DB2, SQL server) in follow-up activities.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n - The reserved/non-reserved SQL keywords in the ANSI SQL standards: https://developer.mimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Standard-SQL-Reserved-Words-Summary.pdf\r\n - SQL Key Words in PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-keywords-appendix.html\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `TableIdentifierParserSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-08T05:09:42Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T23:45:23Z","closed_at":"2019-02-22T23:39:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55f4e05df6691829fe420ce833a819c6d449184c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23259/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23259/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23259/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1ab4f438b296c72953e8609510a628467c3fc95","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-26215-WIP","ref":"SPARK-26215-WIP","sha":"d1ab4f438b296c72953e8609510a628467c3fc95","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose additional verification of JSON options. In particular, detection of using `read` options in `write` and vice versa. The verification can be disabled by new SQL config `spark.sql.verifyDataSourceOptions` (`true` by default). This changes should prevent misusing of JSON options, and improve usage experience of built-in datasource.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test to `JacksonGeneratorSuite` to check how `in read` option is handled if it is passed `in write`. Also the test checks new SQL config can disable the verification.","created_at":"2018-12-07T20:57:27Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:36:17Z","closed_at":"2019-01-11T20:52:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a02e8fb36b6c487079deee42a3f451e3c88c117","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23257/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23257/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23257/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e1db3edbf80b8cb58860118d35317d3cc93edfdd","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:sep-options-in-save-load","ref":"sep-options-in-save-load","sha":"e1db3edbf80b8cb58860118d35317d3cc93edfdd","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nspark.kafka.sasl.kerberos.service.name is an optional parameter but most of the time value `kafka` has to be set. As I've written in the jira the following reasoning is behind:\r\n* Kafka's configuration guide suggest the same value: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_kerberos_brokerconfig\r\n* It would be easier for spark users by providing less configuration\r\n* Other streaming engines are doing the same\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've changed the parameter from optional to `WithDefault` and set `kafka` as default value.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAvailable unit tests + on cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-07T10:42:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T22:02:30Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T22:02:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cbb87fb19fa1a989137ae1edbf0db0d7899e1e88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23254/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23254/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23254/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3f56e78e45e9c983816d8222e06d33092ecb2993","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-26304","ref":"SPARK-26304","sha":"3f56e78e45e9c983816d8222e06d33092ecb2993","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to return partial results from JSON datasource and JSON functions in the PERMISSIVE mode if some of JSON fields are parsed and converted to desired types successfully. The changes are made only for `StructType`. Whole bad JSON records are placed into the corrupt column specified by the `columnNameOfCorruptRecord` option or SQL config.\r\n\r\nPartial results are not returned for malformed JSON input. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UT which checks converting JSON strings with one invalid and one valid field at the end of the string.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-07T10:09:10Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:47Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T08:11:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97b6d04125468f4ed9a04868aafafee73cff2260","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23253/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23253/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23253/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ca9248ed3f9314747c1415bd19760c53019bf36","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:json-bad-record","ref":"json-bad-record","sha":"9ca9248ed3f9314747c1415bd19760c53019bf36","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSome documents of `Distribution/Partitioning` are stale and misleading, this PR fixes them:\r\n1. `Distribution` never have intra-partition requirement\r\n2. `OrderedDistribution` does not require tuples that share the same value being colocated in the same partition.\r\n3. `RangePartitioning` can provide a weaker guarantee for a prefix of its `ordering` expressions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ncomment-only

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a regression introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22104 at Spark 2.4.0.\r\n\r\nWhen we have Python UDF in subquery, we will hit an exception\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.AttributeReference cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.PythonUDF\r\n\tat scala.collection.immutable.Stream.map(Stream.scala:414)\r\n\tat

org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.$anonfun$mapPartitions$2(RDD.scala:815)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22104 turned `ExtractPythonUDFs` from a physical rule to optimizer rule. However, there is a difference between a physical rule and optimizer rule. A physical rule always runs once, an optimizer rule may be applied twice on a query tree even the rule is located in a batch that only runs once.\r\n\r\nFor a subquery, the `OptimizeSubqueries` rule will execute the entire optimizer on the query plan inside subquery. Later on subquery will be turned to joins, and the optimizer rules will be applied to it again.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the `ExtractPythonUDFs` rule is not idempotent. When it's applied twice on a query plan inside subquery, it will produce a malformed plan. It extracts Python UDF from Python exec plans.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes 2 changes to be double safe:\r\n1. `ExtractPythonUDFs` should skip python exec plans, to make the rule idempotent\r\n2. `ExtractPythonUDFs` should skip subquery\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`enablePerfMetrics `was originally designed in `BytesToBytesMap `to control `getNumHashCollisions  getTimeSpentResizingNs  getAverageProbesPerLookup`.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the Spark version gradual progress.  this parameter is only used for `getAverageProbesPerLookup ` and always given to true when using `BytesToBytesMap`.\r\n\r\n it is also dangerous to determine whether `getAverageProbesPerLookup `opens and throws an `IllegalStateException `exception. \r\nSo this pr will be remove `enablePerfMetrics `parameter from `BytesToBytesMap`. thanks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nthe existed test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-06T08:23:01Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:11Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:02:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a6b84e26cb549161b9d08fc061089c8ed156a16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23244/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23244/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23244/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/16d30eca343b401a4402953652d1e8e8e26fb0bb","head":{"label":"heary-cao:enablePerfMetrics","ref":"enablePerfMetrics","sha":"16d30eca343b401a4402953652d1e8e8e26fb0bb","user":{"login":"heary-cao","id":20164092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTY0MDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20164092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao","html_url":"https://github.com/heary-cao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76841445,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Njg0MTQ0NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"heary-cao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"heary-cao","id":20164092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTY0MDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20164092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao","html_url":"https://github.com/heary-cao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/heary-cao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRoot cause: Prior to Spark2.4, When we enable zst for eventLog compression, for inprogress application, It always throws exception in the Application UI, when we open from the history server. But after 2.4 it will display the UI information based on the completed frames in the zstd compressed eventLog. But doesn't read incomplete frames for inprogress application.\r\nIn this PR, we have added 'setContinous(true)' for reading input stream from eventLog, so that it can read from open frames also. (By default 'isContinous=false' for zstd inputStream and when we try to read an open frame, it throws truncated error)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest steps:\r\n1) Add the configurations in the spark-defaults.conf\r\n   (i) spark.eventLog.compress true\r\n   (ii) spark.io.compression.codec zstd \r\n2) Restart history server\r\n3) bin/spark-shell\r\n4) sc.parallelize(1 to 1000, 1000).count\r\n5) Open app UI from the history server UI\r\n\r\n**Before fix**\r\n![screenshot from 2018-12-06
