In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5870\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAdds the ability to create pools with size=-1, allowing infinite task usage, and allowing the used_slots to return without a db query.\r\n\r\nTo contextualize this change, we saw spiky DB queries since this has to query all RUNNING task instances, and each task instance that starts running needs to run this query, leading to an n^2 problem. \r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: add test_infinite_slots\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-08T01:45:25Z","updated_at":"2019-11-10T18:15:36Z","closed_at":"2019-11-10T18:15:36Z","merged_at":"2019-11-10T18:15:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a12041ac06a038e0af68ce3e19e46200d2f6376","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6520/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6520/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6520/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5ceb0ffa1d33fa73bfae8db62e08d28282855c4c","head":{"label":"saguziel:aguziel-2019-11-airflow-infinite-pool-apache","ref":"aguziel-2019-11-airflow-infinite-pool-apache","sha":"5ceb0ffa1d33fa73bfae8db62e08d28282855c4c","user":{"login":"saguziel","id":3968709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3968709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel","html_url":"https://github.com/saguziel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65848919,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTg0ODkxOQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"saguziel/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"saguziel","id":3968709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3968709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel","html_url":"https://github.com/saguziel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/saguziel/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

no start_date\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5869\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nDeserialized operators do not always have start_date set.\r\n\r\nThat, for instance, breaks triggering dags.\r\n\r\nSee the code from DAG.create_dagrun():\r\n```\r\n        run = DagRun(...)\r\n        session.add(run)\r\n        session.commit()\r\n\r\n        run.dag = self\r\n        run.verify_integrity(session=session) # this validation fails because run assumes that all operators have start_date set\r\n        run.refresh_from_db()\r\n```\r\nOne of the optimisation (https://github.com/coufon/airflow/commit/b5ee858f44f55818c589cf2c8bf3866fa5d50e30) we did as part of DAG Serialization was to not store dates in tasks if they have a matching date (start_date or end_date) in DAG. Unfortunately, when triggering DAG containing such tasks, it fails on DagRun.run.verify_integrity.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add the start_date when deserializing the operator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n* `test_deserialization_start_date`\r\n* `test_deserialization_end_date `\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-08T00:40:24Z","updated_at":"2019-11-11T13:26:52Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T13:26:47Z","merged_at":"2019-11-11T13:26:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"3fa64ea7a9476de4810f3b95f170074a2b422206","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6519/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6519/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6519/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8c5e408b992d0c964c1be822b9b53d05a21ca812","head":{"label":"kaxil:fix-dag-start-date","ref":"fix-dag-start-date","sha":"8c5e408b992d0c964c1be822b9b53d05a21ca812","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5867\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `--debug` CLI argument appears to have unintended functionality:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/bin/cli.py#L980\r\n\r\nBecause `testing` and consequently `app.config['TESTING']` are provided as a `str` object, the reloader is only enabled when the `unit_test_mode` property is an empty string. \r\n\r\nRelevant StackOverflow question:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/58366469/what-is-an-efficient-way-to-develop-airflow-plugins-without-restarting-the-web\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis bugfix restores intended functionality. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-07T19:31:41Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T16:03:06Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T13:53:46Z","merged_at":"2019-11-08T13:53:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d798deec6a2c9d8460cbb00b1a565cf81c849f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/620c8f2eeb7188216833719673908ad629c81c5a","head":{"label":"rvanasa:fix-unit-test-mode-boolean","ref":"fix-unit-test-mode-boolean","sha":"620c8f2eeb7188216833719673908ad629c81c5a","user":{"login":"rvanasa","id":522097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjA5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/522097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa","html_url":"https://github.com/rvanasa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":220303157,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjAzMDMxNTc=","name":"airflow","full_name":"rvanasa/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rvanasa","id":522097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjA5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/522097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa","html_url":"https://github.com/rvanasa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvanasa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rvanasa/airflow","description":"Apache

Fixed problem that Kubernetes tests were testing latest master\r\n  rather than what came from the local sources.\r\n* Kind (Kubernetes in Dcocker) is run in the same Docker as Breeze env\r\n* Moved Kubernetes scripts to 'in_container' dir where they belong now\r\n* Kubernetes cluster is reused until it is stopped\r\n* Kubernetes image is build from image in docker already + mounted sources\r\n* Kubectl version name is corrected in the Dockerfile\r\n* KUBERNETES_VERSION can now be used to select Kubernetes version\r\n* Running kubernetes scripts is now easy in Breeze\r\n* We can start/recreate/stop cluster using  --<ACTION>-kind-cluster\r\n* Instructions on how to run Kubernetes tests are updated\r\n* The old \"bare\" environment is replaced by --no-deps switch\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-5704](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5704/)\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  \r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n\r\nAdded AWS DataSync Hook and Operator, along with appropriate tests and documentation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n\r\nTests added for both new components (DataSync hook + operator).\r\n\r\nThe tests require the moto Python library, specifically moto_datasync. \r\nI only recently added moto_datasync to moto, so the Airflow tests for AWS DataSync will be skipped if moto_datasync is not present. \r\nHowever all tests pass on my local copy of moto which includes moto_datasync\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen trying to initialize a KubernetesPodOperator with some RAM and CPU limits, I followed [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/cpu-default-namespace/#what-if-you-specify-a-container-s-limit-but-not-its-request), similar to  and added a dict of form similar to https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/5096fa3e48b4f79a29e4ad430e426c8bc9462449/tests/kubernetes/test_pod_generator.py#L92-L101:\r\n```\r\nresources = {\r\n    \"limits\": {\"memory\": f\"2000Mi\", \"cpu\": \"1.0\"},\r\n    \"requests\": {\"memory\": f\"2000Mi\", \"cpu\": \"1.0\"},\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, this structure seems to not properly propagate, so I tried to make the `resources` dict compatible with the BaseOperator inherited by the KubernetesPodOperator, and found this bug in the source code when using a simplified `resources` dict compatible with the BaseOperator:\r\n```\r\n> /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/models/baseoperator.py(383)__init__()\r\n    382         import ipdb;ipdb.set_trace()\r\n--> 383         self.resources = Resources(*resources) if resources is not None else None\r\n    384         self.run_as_user = run_as_user\r\n\r\nipdb> resources\r\n{'cpus': 1.0, 'ram': 2000}\r\nipdb> Resources(*resources)\r\n*** TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'\r\nipdb> Resources(**resources)\r\n{'cpus': {'_name': 'CPU', '_units_str': 'core(s)', '_qty': 1.0}, 'ram': {'_name': 'RAM', '_units_str': 'MB', '_qty': 2000}, 'disk': {'_name': 'Disk', '_units_str': 'MB', '_qty': 512}, 'gpus': {'_name': 'GPU', '_units_str': 'gpu(s)', '_qty': 0}}\r\nipdb>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a feeling this is the wrong kwarg to limit the resources of the Pod that the KubernetesPodOperator will spawn, since this code is not used at all: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/5096fa3e48b4f79a29e4ad430e426c8bc9462449/airflow/kubernetes/pod.py#L28\r\nInstead, it simply uses https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/5096fa3e48b4f79a29e4ad430e426c8bc9462449/airflow/models/baseoperator.py#L397\r\n\r\nIf someone can tell me how to properly set these resource limits for a KubernetesPod, please let me know.\r\n\r\nMinimum working example:\r\n```py\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.contrib.operators.kubernetes_pod_operator import KubernetesPodOperator\r\n\r\nfrom sb_airflow.default_args import default_args\r\n\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef get_resources(memory=2e3, cpu=1.0):\r\n    \"\"\"Get resources

  \"\"\"\r\n    return {\r\n        \"limits\": {\"memory\": f\"{int(memory)}Mi\", \"cpu\": float(f\"{cpu:.2f}\")},\r\n        \"requests\": {\"memory\": f\"{int(memory)}Mi\", \"cpu\":

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-04T21:09:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T08:50:52Z","closed_at":"2020-03-23T14:25:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2545ed055a5aea838a1423cdbb33dbc4df64e0fe","assignee":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2017921084,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE3OTIxMDg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:production-image","name":"area:production-image","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"Production

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Fixed problem that Kubernetes tests were testing latest master\r\n  rather than what came from the local sources.\r\n* Moved Kubernetes scripts to 'in_container' dir where they belong now\r\n* Kubernetes tests are now better suited for running locally\r\n* Kubernetes cluster is not deleted until environment is stopped\r\n* Kubernetes image is built outside of the container and passed as .tar\r\n* Kubectl version name is corrected in the Dockerfile\r\n* Kubernetes Version can be used to select Kubernetes versio\r\n* Running kubernetes scripts is now easy in Breeze\r\n* Instructions on how to run Kubernetes tests are updated\r\n* Better flags in Breeze are used to run Kubernetes environment/tests\r\n* The old \"bare\" environment is replaced by --no-deps switch\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

change is a further step of simplifying the set of scripts\r\nused by CI. The separate checklicence image was implemented as an\r\noptimisation of the licence check time. The image to download was\r\nsmall and could be downloaded slightly faster in CI. However that\r\nmade all the management script more complex and lead to having\r\nseparate jobs for check licence and static checks. That lead to\r\nactually longer time of Travis jobs - because new machine had to\r\nbe spun-off for checklicence check only.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the CI image is the only one left and it is slightly\r\nbigger (with RAT tool added) but the same image is used for all the\r\ntests - unit tests, static checks and checklicence checks.\r\n\r\nThis also makes it easier to manage the images and decreases update\r\noverhead on the developers using Breeze.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

slim image gave only very small gain on executing the tests in CI. The\r\nimage was significantly smaller, but then for local development and testing\r\nyou needed both full CI and SLIM-CI image.\r\n\r\nThis made the scripts and docker image needlessly complex - especially\r\nin the wake of coming Production image it turned to be premature\r\noptimisation really. While it sped-up (slightly - by 10-20 seconds) some\r\nstatic check jobs in Travis, it increased time needed by developers\r\nto have a working environment and to keep it updated every time it was\r\nneeded (by minutes)\r\n\r\nAlso having two separately managed images made it rather complex to join\r\nsome of the Travis CI jobs (there is a follow-up change with getting rid\r\nof Checklicence image).\r\n\r\nWith this change both static checks and tests are executed using single\r\nimage.

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3959) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3959\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3959\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4026\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn order to allow multiple teams and users to use the same Airflow instance, I've added a tagging option for DAGs.\r\nEach dag can have one, a few or none tags, then the user can filter in the homepage specific tags.\r\nThe filtering is saved in a cookie to save the user preferences.\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5796188/68543690-5652e280-03c3-11ea-96de-96cf3aed9bcf.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5796188/68543702-6a96df80-03c3-11ea-8fd3-45b6d77f8ece.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest_home_filter_tags in view tests, to check if the cookie is set properly.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds pagerduty hook that can be used to trigger pagerduty incidents within a DAG run.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5823\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, Airflow has PinotDbApiHook for querying Pinot,\r\nbut there's no specific hook for ingesting data into it.\r\nThis PR adds a new hook that provides a minimum set of\r\npinot-admin.sh subcommands required to ingest offline data.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI added tests.contrib.hooks.test_pinot_hook.TestPinotAdminHook and implemented the following tests in it:\r\n\r\n- test_add_schema\r\n- test_add_table\r\n- test_create_segment\r\n- test_upload_segment\r\n- test_run_cli_success\r\n- test_run_cli_failure_error_message\r\n- test_run_cli_failure_status_code\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-5736\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5736\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: Move `gcs_to_gdrive_operator.py` from `airflow/contrib/operators` to `airflow/operators`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Already tested\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-31T20:01:36Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T19:30:29Z","closed_at":"2020-02-02T19:30:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f062421ed986648b745f3dff302181ea4c6af28e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5790\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe CLI command for `airflow dags list_runs` displays some headers. The headers listed `start_date` as `state_date`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5819) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe default value `None` throws an error, should be changed to `{}`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI am actually not sure why the issue was not captured in the existing test:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/73bf718358c01cc41e5f23b914a8824a2665a28c/tests/contrib/operators/test_awsbatch_operator.py#L39\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-30T17:03:10Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T19:12:39Z","closed_at":"2019-11-07T19:12:39Z","merged_at":"2019-11-07T19:12:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"63ba1c58423e0f060f1d253fa4ea1504760b5120","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6058\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR switches nosetest to pytest. I tried to keep required changes to minimum.\r\nWhat I have already learned is that:\r\n- many tests depend on database\r\n- order of tests is important\r\n- there are tests that create side effects in logging setup, local settings, config.\r\n\r\nI am open to any suggestions and help.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nI create this draft to invite anyone interested in help in creating working proof of concept. \r\nI tried to keep required changes to minimum but current test suite is so unstable that is hard to keep up with actual master.\r\n\r\nWhat I have already learned is that:\r\n- many tests depend on database\r\n- order of tests is important\r\n- there are tests that create side effects in logging setup, local settings, config.\r\n\r\nI am open to any suggestions and help.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe found this to be a very good signal to alert for any init container related issue. Our worker cluster was affected by a bug in EKS CNI plugin. This metric would have caught the issue automatically.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nLooks like we don't test for stats?\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-30T01:50:45Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T20:51:30Z","closed_at":"2019-11-06T20:46:59Z","merged_at":"2019-11-06T20:46:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"6bcbd487925c2cb3bd10f1a379a0d8d23133c420","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e4f5125c16355d679175237239e5a0384448fe23","head":{"label":"houqp:stats_task_externally_killed","ref":"stats_task_externally_killed","sha":"e4f5125c16355d679175237239e5a0384448fe23","user":{"login":"houqp","id":670302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDMwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp","html_url":"https://github.com/houqp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":198306469,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTgzMDY0Njk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"houqp/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"houqp","id":670302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDMwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp","html_url":"https://github.com/houqp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/houqp/airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5803\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

now the xcom_pull of the task_instance will call XCom.get_one many times, therefore I'd like to change this to XCom.get_many.\r\n\r\n- Merge the query logic of the get_one and get_many as well.\r\n- Only pull the `values` field, since that's the only one we use for the `xcom_pull` for the TaskInstance.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-5804\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5804\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5800\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAirflow provides PinotDbApiHook but its default connection is not\r\ndefined in the DB. This PR adds it for testing purposes and as an\r\nexample, just like other hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo additional test, since it's just adding an initial value to the connection table.\r\nInstead, I confirmed the existing `test_cli_initdb` test succeeded:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./run-tests tests.core:TestCli.test_cli_initdb\r\n\r\n(snip)\r\n\r\nStarting the tests with arguments: tests.core:TestCli.test_cli_initdb\r\n\r\n.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 1 test in 3.942s\r\n\r\nOK\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I also confirmed that the new database entry worked with a real Pinot cluster, as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl -LO https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/pinot/apache-pinot-incubating-0.1.0/apache-pinot-incubating-0.1.0-bin.tar.gz\r\n$ tar xfz apache-pinot-incubating-0.1.0-bin.tar.gz\r\n$ cd apache-pinot-incubating-0.1.0-bin\r\n$ nohup bin/pinot-admin.sh StartZookeeper &\r\n$ nohup bin/pinot-admin.sh StartController &\r\n$ nohup bin/pinot-admin.sh StartBroker &\r\n$ nohup bin/pinot-admin.sh StartServer &\r\n$ bin/pinot-admin.sh AddSchema -schemaFile sample_data/baseballStats_offline_table_config.json -exec\r\n$ bin/pinot-admin.sh AddTable -filePath sample_data/baseballStats_offline_table_config.json -exec\r\n$ bin/pinot-admin.sh CreateSegment -dataDir sample_data -outDir /tmp/outDir -tableName baseballStats -segmentName baseball -schemaFile sample_data/baseballStats_schema.json\r\n$ bin/pinot-admin.sh UploadSegment -segmentDir /tmp/outDir\r\n$ airflow db init\r\n\r\n(snip)\r\n\r\nDone.\r\n$ ipython\r\n\r\n(snip)\r\n\r\nIn [2]: from airflow.contrib.hooks.pinot_hook import PinotDbApiHook                                                                                                          \r\n\r\nIn [3]: hook = PinotDbApiHook()                                                                                                                                              \r\n\r\nIn [4]: hook.get_first(\"SELECT * FROM baseballStats\")                                                                                                                        \r\n[2019-10-29 01:37:33,596] {base_hook.py:89} INFO - Using connection to: id: pinot_broker_default.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-29T08:50:01Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T17:14:13Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T17:14:13Z","merged_at":"2020-04-02T17:14:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"6126bbbd576da22caaf9bdc8e8ac67081c1d98d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2991e616583c10ab6dfe31d94b8d4bcd7112bff0","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-5800","ref":"AIRFLOW-5800","sha":"2991e616583c10ab6dfe31d94b8d4bcd7112bff0","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5773\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR migrates all AWS Athena components to `/providers/aws`. Since this is the first out of many AWS component to migrate, this PR also creates new modules and `__init__.py` files in `/providers/aws` and required config in docs.\r\n\r\nRelated PR migrating all AWS components, but decided to split because of size: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6439.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-27T10:48:05Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T20:21:34Z","closed_at":"2019-10-28T20:20:35Z","merged_at":"2019-10-28T20:20:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"59b6d8bf10d4e08fb4418fa2c8eb7d4a5749383c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

operator creates dynamically an ephemeral Connection object. It persists to metastore during execution and deletes afterward.\r\n\r\nThis behavior has negative impact on our ability to refactor creds management.\r\n\r\nBy not persisting to database, we can also remove some complexity re ensuring connection is deleted in event of failure, and the tests that go along with that.\r\n\r\nThis change requires that we add optional param `connection` to both MySqlHook and PostgresHook.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this PR incorporates test simplifications originally in unmerged PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6390 and will render that PR obsolete.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5753\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn addition to LatestOnlyOperator, DailyLatestOnlyOperator is for cases that we need to run only the latest run in the series of task run, but to ensure that the task is run at least once in a day.\r\n\r\nThis is useful when we scrape external data from third-parties on an hourly basis/for multiple times in a day to keep data up-to-date. If the DAG is paused for several days, we want to avoid multiple runs in a day, but still want to ensure data is filled in every daily window.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`test_daily_latest_only_operator.py` added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-25T02:46:01Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T15:03:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-17T15:03:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7adfce9e0455d70ed0ac5d0452d40282fdb30696","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nHeartbeat sleep shouldn't need to read DB state, it's good enough to base it on the original time.\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Add a convenience method `get_uri` on `Connection` object to generate the URI for a connection.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5751) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-5751\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5751\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBuilding URI for use in connection env var can be a nuisance.  This is a convenience method that will do it for you, given a connection object.  \r\n\r\nSo if you have created one in UI, you could do BaseHook.get_connection(conn_id).get_uri().\r\n\r\nOr build using init params on `Connection` object and call `get_uri()`.\r\n\r\nI think it could also be nice if each hook had a `get_uri` method that would take all relevant params and produce a correctly encoded URI.  If that were implemented, it could use this function for that purpose. \r\n\r\nI added tests to verify that generated URIs, when parsed again, produce the same connection object.  For this I used the same URIs we were already testing.  And as part of this there was an efficiency in refactoring the existing from_uri test.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the
