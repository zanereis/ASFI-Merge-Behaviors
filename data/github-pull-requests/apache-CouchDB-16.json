User requests may specify that option and then when the db is re-opened, it will allow it to automatically upgrade to the new db instance instead of returning an error.\r\n\r\nBackground processes will still get a `database_doest_not_exist` error if they keep a db open which has now been re-created.\r\n\r\nThe interactive option may also be used in the future to set other transaction parameters like timeouts and retries that might be different for interactive requests vs background tasks.\r\n\r\n~Previously the UUID was checked in an attempt to prevent successfully re-opening an old database instance, in case it was deleted and re-created.

is the first per-doc-access PR worth sharing more widely.\r\n\r\nThis allows the creation of databases with the option `access` enabled. Access-enabled databases require docs from regular users to have a new `\"_access\": [\"owner\"]` field, that matches the submitting `userCtx.name`. As a result, a user will get full `_all_docs` and `_changes` (and all the other APIs) scoped to just the docs where their name is in the `access` field. See https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/blob/rfc/010-per-document-access/rfcs/010-per-document-access-control.md for some more info on how it all fits together.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple parts to all this:\r\n\r\n1. A new access query server that creates two new indexes `by-access-id` and `by-access-seq` which include all docs in their respective sort orders, but bucketed by user. This required teaching `couch_index` to index deleted docs conditionally.\r\n\r\n2. A switch in the mrview code that access `_all_docs` and `_changes` that uses the new indexes for users that are not db or server admins.\r\n\r\n3. All the plumbing to handle access information everywhere we need it. It is stored in `#doc` `#doc_info` and `#full_doc_info` records, so we can avoid loading full doc bodies on doc updates.\r\n\r\n4. All the actual access validation for document CRUD, especially updates, including replicated updates (mainly in couch_db.erl and couch_db_updater.erl).\r\n\r\n5. Teaching the replicator to write `_local` doc checkpoints as the user that owns the replication.\r\n\r\n6. All users from the `_users` db now have an implicit role `_users` that will become handy later.\r\n\r\n7. Some odds and ends across various modules to make the acquainted with the new reality.\r\n\r\n8. The test suite is quite extensive (1k + LOC) and covers most scenarios.\r\n\r\n9. Current caveats:\r\n- performance regression in `couchdb_update_conflicts_test.erl` something when from `O(log n)` to `O(n)` or worse. I hope more sets of eyes help with this 👀👀👀.\r\n- a few tests needed adjustments in BC-breaking ways (in terms of sort order IIRC, this is a missing, or superfluous `lists:reverse()` somewhere, that shouldn’t be hard to spot.\r\n- there are a few unused variables, function args, or full functions, that will get cleaned up of course.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n`make check` ;)\r\n\r\nBut also, read the test suite and the linked RFC.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#1524 \r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen OTP processes crash OTP logs the current state of the process and last message it received in the log file.\r\nHowever this feature can lead to leakage of sensitive date into log files. Preventing this from happening requires fixing both sources of leakage. The leakage via state term could be prevented via usage of `format_status/2` callback intended to reformat state before passing it to logger. The leakage via last message is harder to prevent because there is no good way to detect sensitive data in arbitrary term. The safest approach is to remove the last message term before it is included into log message. However in some cases last message can be a useful debugging tool that's why instead of removing it altogether I've added `[log]-> strip_last_msg = false` configuration option. The extra configuration option wouldn't cause an extra latency thanks to an optimization in couch_log application.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes sensitive data from state terms. It also tries to make state size predictable by replacing complex terms with size of the term (for example for lists we use `length(List)` and for dict we use `dict:size(Dict)`).  \r\nThis PR is not sufficient to remove all sensitive data from logs, see other parts of the solution in the following independent PRs:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/apache/couchdb-config/pull/30 - this would require a follow up PR to pass sensitive flag\r\n* https://github.com/apache/couchdb-ibrowse/pull/4 - similar PR for ibrowse\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRegression testing can be done using `make check`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n* This is an alternative to https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2627\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

Overview\r\n\r\nThis introduces the `.asf.yaml` file, which gives us direct control over GitHub features we've previously had to ask ASF Infra to maintain for us.\r\n\r\nFor now, this PR introduces only one specific change: it disables the ability to directly merge a PR with a branch. Instead, only the \"squash\" and \"rebase\" options will be allowed.\r\n\r\nBecause of this I am requesting 3 +1s from committers before I'll merge this change - though only a lazy majority is required.\r\n\r\nPlease see lines 29-32 of the file. We can also make this change if we want - which would send new/closed PR notifications to dev@, while sending all comments/etc to notifications@ as we do today.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nActive Tasks requires TotalChanges and ChangesDone to show the progress\r\nof long running tasks. This requires `count_changes_since/2` to be\r\nimplemented. Unfortunately, that is not easily done  with\r\nfoundationdb. This commit replaces TotalChanges with the\r\nversionstamp + the number of docs as a progress indicator. This can\r\npossibly break existing api that relys on TotalChanges. ChangesDone\r\nwill still exist, but instead of relying on the current changes seq\r\nit is simply a reflection of how many documents were written by the\r\nupdater process.\r\n\r\nThe new responses look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"node\": \"node1@127.0.0.1\",\r\n        \"pid\": \"<0.622.0>\",\r\n        \"changes_done\": 199,\r\n        \"current_version_stamp\": \"8131141649532-0-198\",\r\n        \"database\": \"testdb\",\r\n        \"db_version_stamp\": \"8131141649532-0-999\",\r\n        \"design_document\": \"_design/example\",\r\n        \"started_on\": 1594703583,\r\n        \"type\": \"indexer\",\r\n        \"updated_on\": 1594703586\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"node\": \"node1@127.0.0.1\",\r\n        \"pid\": \"<0.1030.0>\",\r\n        \"changes_done\": 1000,\r\n        \"current_version_stamp\": \"8131194932916-0-999\",\r\n        \"database\": \"testdb\",\r\n        \"db_version_stamp\": \"8131194932916-0-999\",\r\n        \"design_document\": \"_design/example\",\r\n        \"started_on\": 1594703636,\r\n        \"type\": \"indexer\",\r\n        \"updated_on\": 1594703665\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this only shows one process. IIUC, we can have multiple workers indexing in parallel. I think this approach also takes care of this with the ChangesDone only reflecting how many documents have been indexed for that range.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTests need to be added.

Overview\r\n\r\nAdding emilio check into Makefile was a mistake. Without automatic linter it is almost impossible to fix the style. Also emilio doesn’t allow disabling the checks. The idea was that by checking only warnings around (+-3 lines) modified lines we could gradually update the style as we go. However by updating these extra lines we trigger even more warnings and you end up changing style for the whole module. Things like “402 - import declaration found” is especially hard to fix.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Change style for one of the erlang source files\r\n2. Run tests `make check` - the execution output should pass the point where emilio warnings are displayed\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently the EPI plugins have no easy way to modify body of the document in\r\nbefore request. There are complicated approaches via overriding compression header.\r\nIn any case you are obligated to serialize your data structure into JSON. \r\nThis is due to the fact that `chttp:json_body/1` expects compressed body.\r\nWe can rely on the fact that `MochiReq:recv_body/1` returns binary to allow\r\npassing of already parsed JSON terms (objects and lists). \r\nIf we do so we can modify request's body as easy as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReq#httpd{req_body = {[{<<\"hello\">>, <<\"couch\">>}]}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make check`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously the auth was injected unconidtionally. There were two problems:\r\n\r\n1. no way to specify `basic_auth` credentials\r\n2. no way to disable injection\r\n\r\nDue to #2 it was impossible to use other user than hardcoded `adm` in `Couch.login/3`.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe following should be sufficient to test for regressions\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake exunit tests=src/chttpd/test/exunit/pagination_test.exs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

the bypass existed, ioq would call `gen_server:call()`\r\non hehalf of it calling module with the queueing logic in between.\r\n\r\nCommit e641a740 introduced a way to bypass any queues, but the\r\ndelegated `gen_server:call()` there was added without a timeout\r\nparameter, leading to a default timeout of 5000ms.\r\n\r\nA problem manifests here when operations that are sent through\r\nioq that take longer than that 5000ms timeout. In practice, these\r\noperations should be very rare and this timeout should be a help\r\non overloaded systems. However, one sure-fire way to cause an issue\r\non an otherwise idle machine is raise the max_document_size and\r\nstore unreasonably large documents, think 50MB+ of raw JSON).\r\n\r\nNot that we recommend this, but folks have run this fine on 2.x\r\nbefore the ioq changes and it isn’t too hard to support here.\r\n\r\nBy adding an `infinity` timeout delegated `gen_server:call()` in\r\nthe queue bypasse case, this no longer applies.\r\n\r\nThanks to Joan @wohali Touzet, Bob @rnewson Newson and\r\nPaul @davisp Davis for helping to track this

the bypass existed, ioq would call `gen_server:call()`\r\non hehalf of it calling module with the queueing logic in between.\r\n\r\nCommit e641a740 introduced a way to bypass any queues, but the\r\ndelegated `gen_server:call()` there was added without a timeout\r\nparameter, leading to a default timeout of 5000ms.\r\n\r\nA problem manifests here when operations that are sent through\r\nioq that take longer than that 5000ms timeout. In practice, these\r\noperations should be very rare and this timeout should be a help\r\non overloaded systems. However, one sure-fire way to cause an issue\r\non an otherwise idle machine is raise the max_document_size and\r\nstore unreasonably large documents, think 50MB+ of raw JSON).\r\n\r\nNot that we recommend this, but folks have run this fine on 2.x\r\nbefore the ioq changes and it isn’t too hard to support here.\r\n\r\nBy adding an `infinity` timeout delegated `gen_server:call()` in\r\nthe queue bypasse case, this no longer applies.\r\n\r\nThanks to Joan @wohali Touzet, Bob @rnewson Newson and\r\nPaul @davisp Davis for helping to track this

Overview\r\n\r\nThe `couch_epi` test suite is flaky. The result of the tests depends on the order of applications eunit runs.\r\nThe failures happen when `crypto` app is not running prior to starting couch_epi test suite. This PR changes the way we start `couch_epi` to insure its dependencies are automatically started. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThere is no good way to reproduce the issue. We just run full test suite to make sure there are no new regressions.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake check\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is

Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nTo use multiple `drilldown` parameters users had to define\r\n`drilldown` multiple times to be able supply them.\r\n\r\nThis caused interoperability issues as most languages require\r\ndefining query parameters and request bodies as associative\r\narrays, maps or dictionaries where the keys are unique.\r\n\r\nThis change enables defining `drilldown` as a list of lists so\r\nthat other languages can define multiple drilldown keys and values.\r\n\r\n## Testing

Overview\r\n\r\nThe caching logic was quite complicated and some of the underlying assumptions turned out to be not quite right. Originally we had planned to condition db handles mainly on the metadataVersion key. However, it turns out invalidating every db handle whenever any design doc in the cluster is updated was a bit too \"thundering herd\"-ish. This changes the primary cache to be the `db_version` key that's kept for each database.\r\n\r\nWe've also changed the `db_version` to be a version stamped value. This means we can reuse it for protecting cache updates in `fabric2_server` which is included as part of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`$ make check`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n-

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen `iss` claim is present in JWT token, but `required_claims` does _not_ contain iss, then `Invalid iss claim` error happens. This is happening, because when validating iss, there is no handling for such situation.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nAdded `jwt auth with not required but present (in token) iss claim`. It can be executed with\r\n\r\n`make elixir`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThe problem has been reported in #2931 and suggested it has been solved by #2888. However, #2888 addresses other issue, not this one.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters

couch_views by using a separate set of acceptors and workers. Previously, all `max_workers` where spawned on startup, and were to waiting to accept jobs in parallel. In a setup with a large number of pods, and 100 workers per pod, that could lead to a lot of conflicts  being generated when all those workers race to accept the same job at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe improvement is to spawn only a limited number of acceptors (5, by default), then, spawn more after some of them become workers. Also, when some workers finish or die with an error, check if more acceptors could be spawned.\r\n\r\nAs an example, here is what might happen with `max_acceptors = 5` and `max_workers = 100` (`A` and `W` are the current counts of acceptors and workers, respectively):\r\n\r\n1. Starting out:\r\n  `A = 5, W = 0`\r\n\r\n2. After 2 acceptors start running:\r\n  `A = 3, W = 2`\r\nThen immediately 2 more acceptors are spawned:\r\n  `A = 5, W = 2`\r\n\r\n3. After 95 workers are started:\r\n  `A = 5, W = 95`\r\n\r\n4. Now if 3 acceptors accept, it would look like:\r\n  `A = 2, W = 98`\r\nBut no more acceptors would be started.\r\n\r\n5. If the last 2 acceptors also accept jobs: \r\n  `A = 0, W = 100`\r\nAt this  point no more indexing jobs can be accepted and started until at  least one of the workers finish and exit.\r\n\r\n6. If 1 worker exits:\r\n  `A = 0, W = 99`\r\nAn acceptor will be immediately spawned\r\n  `A = 1, W = 99`\r\n\r\n7. If all 99 workers exit, it will go back to:\r\n `A = 5, W = 0`\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-04T22:19:07Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T17:14:37Z","closed_at":"2020-06-08T17:14:33Z","merged_at":"2020-06-08T17:14:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"3536ad87088ad0901cf28213f006ddf7c52b85b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2928/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2928/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2928/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/13b724af5b634ddb7b20e913f47fd3fff2d547b2","head":{"label":"apache:optimize-couch-views-acceptors","ref":"optimize-couch-views-acceptors","sha":"13b724af5b634ddb7b20e913f47fd3fff2d547b2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

of max workers all waiting on accept, and racing to grab the same job,\r\ngenerating conflicts and retries in the process, switch to having `A` acceptors\r\nand `W` workers as separate configurable items, such that `A < W`.\r\n\r\nA smaller number of acceptors (5 by default) will be spawned and will wait to\r\naccept jobs. As soon any one accepts a job, and start executing, they will\r\nnotify the parent server via a gen_server call. The main couch_views_server,\r\nwhen notified, will mark the acceptor as a worker as long as `A + W <\r\nmax_workers`.\r\n\r\nWhen any worker exists, the main server may spawn more acceptors if number of\r\ncurrent acceptors `A < max_acceptors` _and_ `A + W < max_workers`.\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind `A + W < max_workers` is that we consider acceptors as\r\npotential workers, they could accept a job at any time and immediately start\r\nexecuting it, so we wouldn't want to start another acceptor.\r\n\r\nAs an example here is what might happen with say max_acceptors = 5 and\r\nmax_workers = 100:\r\n\r\n1. Starting out:\r\n  `A = 5, W = 0`\r\n\r\n2. After 2 acceptors get jobs and start running them:\r\n  `A = 3, W = 2`\r\nThen immediately spawn another 2 acceptors:\r\n  `A = 5, W = 2`\r\n\r\n3. After 95 workers are started it might look like:\r\n  `A = 5, W = 95`\r\n\r\n4. Now if 3 acceptors accept a job, it would look like:\r\n  `A = 2, W = 98`\r\nBut no more acceptors would be started.\r\n\r\n5. If the last 2 acceptors also accept jobs it might look like:\r\n `A = 0, W = 100`\r\nThis is when it reaches full utilization and doesn't accept any more jobs.\r\n\r\n6. Then if 1 worker exits:\r\n `A = 0, W = 99`\r\nAnd 1 acceptor will be spawned\r\n `A = 1, W = 99`\r\n\r\n7. If all 99 workers exit, it will go back to:\r\n `A = 5, W = 0`\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-04T22:18:50Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T22:18:56Z","closed_at":"2020-06-04T22:18:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c3965a85e076b7a7ccbb6e70056407e18ad0e472","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/b4cfd7a78928a0a2f7c35818d6f4d428f1ff83ab","head":{"label":"apache:optimize-couch-views-acceptors","ref":"optimize-couch-views-acceptors","sha":"b4cfd7a78928a0a2f7c35818d6f4d428f1ff83ab","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the `_couchdb.roles` custom claim configurable from the `local.ini` file, so it can be used with any OpenID Connect (OIDC) compliant service, such as Auth0 (https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/scope-custom-claims)\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. In your `local.ini` file, under the `[jwt_auth]` section, add this line:\r\n```ini\r\nroles_claim_name = https://example.com/roles\r\n```\r\n2. Use this token to send some requests to your CouchDB instance:
