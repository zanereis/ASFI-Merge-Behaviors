support for handling the update voter RPC. The update voter RPC is used to automatically update the voters supported kraft versions and available endpoints as the operator upgrades and reconfigures the KRaft controllers.\r\n\r\nThe add voter RPC is handled as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Check that the leader has fenced the previous leader(s) by checking that the HWM is known, otherwise return the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n2. Check that the cluster supports kraft.version 1, otherwise return the UNSUPPORTED_VERSION error.\r\n3. Check that there are no uncommitted voter changes, otherwise return the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n4. Check that the updated voter still supports the currently finalized kraft.version, otherwise return the INVALID_REQUEST error.\r\n5. Check that the updated voter is still listening on the default listener.\r\n6. Append the updated VotersRecord to the log. The KRaft internal listener will read this uncommitted record from the log and update the voter in the set of voters.\r\n7. Wait for the VotersRecord to commit using the majority of the voters. Return a REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error if it doesn't commit in time.\r\n8. Send the UpdateVoter successful response to the voter.\r\n\r\nLastly, this change also implements the ability for the leader to update its own entry in the voter set when it becomes leader for an epoch. This is done by updating the voter set and writing a control batch as the first batch in a new leader epoch.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-30T18:54:13Z","updated_at":"2024-08-05T18:32:47Z","closed_at":"2024-08-05T18:32:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21271452179b00b677c39842164c144a9fb3c202","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6787634831,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABlJMWjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-853","name":"KIP-853","color":"D00CA6","default":false,"description":"KRaft

ShareConsumeRequestManager, currently every time we perform a `commitSync`/`commitAsync`/`acknowledgeOnClose`  we create one `AcknowledgeRequestState` for each call. But this can be optimised further as we can batch up the acknowledgements to be sent to the same node before the next `poll()` is invoked.\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that between 2 polls, the acknowledgements are accumulated in one request per node and then sent during poll, resulting in lesser RPC calls.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we are storing a pair of acknowledge request states for every node, the `first` value denotes the requestState for `commitAsync()` and the `second` value denotes the requestState for `commitSync()` and `acknowledgeOnClose()`. All the acknowledgements to be sent to a particular node are stored in the corresponding acknowledgeRequestState based on whether it was synchronous or asynchronous.","created_at":"2024-07-30T07:58:44Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T15:13:37Z","closed_at":"2024-08-08T15:13:37Z","merged_at":"2024-08-08T15:13:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"0cbc5e083a936025a85f127102dc1032f6cf4fd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6979675393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABoAVlAQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-932","name":"KIP-932","color":"DA462F","default":false,"description":"Queues

About\r\nIdentified a couple of reliability issues with broker code for share groups - \r\n\r\n1. Broker seems to get stuck at times when using multiple share consumers due to a corner case where the second last fetch request did not contain any topic partition to fetch, because of which the broker could never complete the last request. This results in a share fetch request getting stuck.\r\n2. Since persister would not perform any business logic around sending state batches for a share partition, there could be scenarios where it sends state batches with no AVAILABLE records. This could cause a breach on the limit of in-flight messages we have configured, and hence broker would never be able to complete the share fetch requests.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe added code has been tested with unit tests.","created_at":"2024-07-29T06:40:42Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T19:46:58Z","closed_at":"2024-07-29T19:46:58Z","merged_at":"2024-07-29T19:46:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"6ff51bc388dac55e04343fe4247b1080f1241dab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16711/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16711/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16711/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/541ec026cf65ef57db81070dce9071005e567fa2","head":{"label":"adixitconfluent:kafka-17210","ref":"kafka-17210","sha":"541ec026cf65ef57db81070dce9071005e567fa2","user":{"login":"adixitconfluent","id":144765188,"node_id":"U_kgDOCKDxBA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144765188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/adixitconfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":741835228,"node_id":"R_kgDOLDeB3A","name":"kafka","full_name":"adixitconfluent/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adixitconfluent","id":144765188,"node_id":"U_kgDOCKDxBA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144765188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/adixitconfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adixitconfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adixitconfluent/kafka","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17209\r\n## More detailed description of your change\r\nThe difference between `ClassicConsumer` and `AsyncConsumer` is ClassicConsumer is single thread and AsyncConsumer is two thread, one is app thread, the other is background thread.\r\n\r\n`Fetch` Request is generated by background thread and `ListOffset` Request is generated by application thread.\r\nThis will make `testCurrentLag` fail if AsyncConsumer generated `Fetch Request`  first.\r\nSo we support out of order feature for `MockClient` to resolve issue.\r\n\r\nAnother difference between asyncConsumer and ClassicConsumer is front do generate additional `FetchOffset` Request from CommitRequestManager but ClassicConsumer does not have the request.\r\n\r\nThe reason is  coordinator is not ready during test for `ClassicConsumer`  so we can ignore this request for `AsyncConsumer`\r\n\r\n## Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-27T07:26:32Z","updated_at":"2024-09-15T13:34:46Z","closed_at":"2024-08-31T05:16:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba0d578df728d4a7540e7d94fa03188dc719b13a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

an edge case where segments that failed to be copied to the tiered storage layer caused an early deletion of relevant segments.\r\n\r\nThis edge case occurs because we are counting up the amount of data to delete in `buildRetentionSizeData` before counting down from there in `remoteLogRetentionHandler.isSegmentBreachedByRetentionSize` untill we have deleted enough bytes.\r\n\r\nIn the case where we have some segments in state `COPY_SEGMENT_STARTED` those segments will increase the counter of bytes to be deleted which will cause the eviction of the oldest segment as the loop on L1221 building the list of segments to be deleted `segmentsToDelete` is sorted from oldest to earliest.\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR I have made a small refactor of building the leader epoch set in its own function as we were reaching the maximum complexity. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

discussed in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16657#discussion_r1686938593 , we should make logger as static to avoid creating multiple logger instances.\r\nI use the regex `private.*Logger.*LoggerFactory` to search and check all the results if certain logs need to be static. \r\n\r\nThere are some exceptions that loggers don't need to be static:\r\n* The logger in the inner class. Since java8 doesn't support static field in the inner class.\r\n  * https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/FetchRequestManagerTest.java#L3676\r\n* Custom loggers for each instance (non-static + non-final). In this case, multiple logger instances is actually really needed.\r\n  * https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/storage/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/server/log/remote/storage/LocalTieredStorage.java#L166\r\n* The logger is initialized in constructor by LogContext. Many non-static but with final modifier loggers are in this category, that's why I use `.*LoggerFactory` to only check the loggers that are assigned initial value when declaration.\r\n* `protected final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(getClass())`\r\nThis is for subclass can do logging with subclass name instead of superclass name.\r\nBut in this case, if the log access modifier is private, the purpose cannot be achieved since subclass cannot access the log defined in superclass. So if access modifier is private, we can replace `getClass()` with `<className>.class`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-24T16:30:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T03:53:09Z","closed_at":"2024-07-30T18:37:36Z","merged_at":"2024-07-30T18:37:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c0a96d08d81c2f91c10c601f1e0fd6f4f5f6268","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e4332949fc12d0e66ddc280ef13f34f4d70fa2cd","head":{"label":"mingyen066:KAFKA-17185-Make-logger-static-to-avoid-creating-multiple-logger-instances","ref":"KAFKA-17185-Make-logger-static-to-avoid-creating-multiple-logger-instances","sha":"e4332949fc12d0e66ddc280ef13f34f4d70fa2cd","user":{"login":"mingyen066","id":6782723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODI3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6782723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066","html_url":"https://github.com/mingyen066","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":789633182,"node_id":"R_kgDOLxDYng","name":"kafka","full_name":"mingyen066/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mingyen066","id":6782723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODI3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6782723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066","html_url":"https://github.com/mingyen066","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingyen066/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mingyen066/kafka","description":"Mirror

MetadataVersion 3.7-IV2 and above, the broker's AssignmentsManager sends an RPC to the controller informing it about which directory we have chosen to place each new replica on. Unfortunately, the code does not check to see if the topic still exists in the MetadataImage before sending the RPC. It will also retry infinitely. Therefore, after a topic is created and deleted in rapid succession, we can get stuck including the now-defunct replica in our subsequent AssignReplicasToDirsRequests forever.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent this problem, the AssignmentsManager should check if a topic still exists (and is still present on the broker in question) before sending the RPC. In order to prevent log spam, we should not log any error messages until several minutes have gone past without success. Finally, rather than creating a new EventQueue event for each assignment request, we should simply modify a shared data structure and schedule a deferred event to send the accumulated RPCs. This will improve efficiency.","created_at":"2024-07-24T03:53:00Z","updated_at":"2024-08-10T11:31:45Z","closed_at":"2024-08-10T11:31:45Z","merged_at":"2024-08-10T11:31:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1b2adea07cebaac6d1138ec18778c575aef57f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9fe61b150785b275374ff6daa1ca516a4927a680","head":{"label":"cmccabe:cmccabe_fix_assignments_manager","ref":"cmccabe_fix_assignments_manager","sha":"9fe61b150785b275374ff6daa1ca516a4927a680","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

the RemoveVoter RPC. The general algorithm is as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Check that the leader has fenced the previous leader(s) by checking that the HWM is known, otherwise return the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n2. Check that the cluster supports kraft.version 1, otherwise return the UNSUPPORTED_VERSION error.\r\n3. Check that there are no uncommitted voter changes, otherwise return the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n4. Append the updated VotersRecord to the log. The KRaft internal listener will read this uncommitted record from the log and add the new voter to the set of voters.\r\n5. Wait for the VotersRecord to commit using the majority of the new set of voters. Return a REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error if it doesn't commit in time.\r\n6. Send the RemoveVoter successful response to the client.\r\n7. Resign the leadership if the leader is not in the new voter set\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that now that KRaft supports both the remove voter and add voter RPC, only one change can be pending at once. This is achieved in the following ways. The AddVoter RPC checks if there are pending AddVoter or RemoveVoter RPC. The RemoveVoter RPC checks if there are any pending AddVoter or RemoveVoter RPC. Both RPCs check that there is no uncommitted VotersRecord.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

part of KIP-853, storage-tool.sh now has two new flags: --standalone, and --initial-voters. This PR implements these two flags in storage-tool.sh.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two valid ways to format a cluster:\r\n\r\n- The pre-KIP-853 way, where you use a statically configured controller quorum. In this case, neither --standalone nor --initial-voters may be specified, and kraft.version must be set to 0.\r\n\r\n- The KIP-853 way, where one of --standalone and --initial-voters must be specified with the initial value of the dynamic controller quorum. In this case, kraft.version must be set to 1.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the formatting logic out of StorageTool.scala and into Formatter.java. The tool file was never intended to get so huge, or to implement complex logic like generating metadata records. Those things should be done by code in the metadata or raft gradle modules. This is also useful for junit tests, which often need to do formatting. (The 'info' and 'random-uuid' commands remain in StorageTool.scala, for now.)","created_at":"2024-07-23T21:26:17Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T22:47:49Z","closed_at":"2024-08-02T22:47:45Z","merged_at":"2024-08-02T22:47:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"02f541d4ea51ee9034f92d249dde96bc70860e5e","assignee":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6787634831,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABlJMWjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-853","name":"KIP-853","color":"D00CA6","default":false,"description":"KRaft

PR aims to add address the comments added via the docker hub folks regarding the JVM based Docker Official Image for Apache Kafka introduced in the following KIP - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1028%3A+Docker+Official+Image+for+Apache+Kafka . The comments by the dockerhub folks can be found [here](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/16970#pullrequestreview-2151987928) .\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\nAddresses comments 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 mentioned in the above link.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The changes have been made to both the JVM docker images introduced via [KIP-975](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=263428303) as well as the GraalVM docer images introduced via [KIP-974](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-974%3A+Docker+Image+for+GraalVM+based+Native+Kafka+Broker). This ensures that the docker hub suggested best practices will now be used for both the OSS sponsored images as well as the Docker Official Images.\r\n\r\nGist:\r\n1. USER root is unnecessary - removed this\r\n3. apk update is unnecessary with --no-cache - removed this\r\n4. apk upgrade is not allowed - removed this\r\n5. Specific, individual GPG keys should be referenced by ID. - new approach uses hardcoded GPG keys\r\n6. All invocations of gpg should include --batch - this has been adhered to\r\n7. The kafka tarball should be verified prior to being unpacked - change has been made\r\n8. The DOI build system sets appropriate annotations, so we recommend not setting labels, which have been deprecated. - deprecated labels have been removed, and now annotations are used\r\n9. Is apk cache clean necessary since you have previously specified --no-cache? - removed this\r\n\r\nPost this PR:\r\n1. Propogate these modifications to the 3.7.0 docker official images Dockerfile. \r\n2. Modify [existing PR](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/16970) with PR template generation script for 3.7.0 under docker official images repo.\r\n3.

is based loosely off of the changes in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15642, but with modifications that address some of the outstanding comments left on that PR.\r\n\r\nI've verified locally (by running the affected test cases through a debugger) that the validation error messages remain the same (which was one of the concerns with the latest approach used in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15642). If reviewers believe it'd be worth the additional work, I can also add assertions to our tests to programmatically ensure that the appropriate error messages are generated.\r\n\r\n### Committer

to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16900,\r\n\r\nCurrently, users need to set --transaction-duration-ms to enable transactions in kafka-producer-perf-test, which is not straightforward. A better approach is to enable transactions when a transaction ID is provided.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows enabling transaction in kafka-producer-perf-test by either\r\n- set `transaction.id=<id>` via `--producer-props` or\r\n- set `transaction.id=<id>` in config file via `--producer.config` or\r\n- set `--transaction-id <id>` or\r\n- set `--transaction-duration-ms=<ms>`\r\n\r\n### Committer
