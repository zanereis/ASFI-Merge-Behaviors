allows Broadcast Variables can be released properly\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBroadcast variables, while usually used to broadcast data to executors, can also be used to control the scope and lifecycle of shared resources (e.g. connection pools). When creating and destroying those resources within a task is expensive, using a broadcast variable to keep them deserialized in memory for multiple tasks to share can make a huge difference in the efficiency of a Spark job.\r\n\r\nIn `MemoryStore`, check if any entries in a `DeserializedMemoryEntry` implement `AutoClosable` and, if so, call `close` on those resources. This occurs in two places:\r\n- `remove` of an individual item\r\n- `clear` of the MemoryStore\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded additional tests to `MemoryStoreSuite` in order to check that we properly close resources, and handle exceptions properly.","created_at":"2018-05-14T16:32:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T16:20:48Z","closed_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68602f018e16fd367eab05e77e1be2af8d1249d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21322/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21322/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21322/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/790c906062fc55f553a5cecb61147f801875d4b2","head":{"label":"JeetKunDoug:handle-autoclosable-objects","ref":"handle-autoclosable-objects","sha":"790c906062fc55f553a5cecb61147f801875d4b2","user":{"login":"JeetKunDoug","id":682821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/682821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug","html_url":"https://github.com/JeetKunDoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133367902,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzMzNjc5MDI=","name":"spark","full_name":"JeetKunDoug/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JeetKunDoug","id":682821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/682821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug","html_url":"https://github.com/JeetKunDoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeetKunDoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JeetKunDoug/spark","description":"Mirror

to Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4502)\r\n\r\n_N.B. This is a restart of PR #16578 which includes a subset of that code. Relevant review comments from that PR should be considered incorporated by reference. Please avoid duplication in review by reviewing that PR first. The summary below is an edited copy of the summary of the previous PR._\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOne of the hallmarks of a column-oriented data storage format is the ability to read data from a subset of columns, efficiently skipping reads from other columns. Spark has long had support for pruning unneeded top-level schema fields from the scan of a parquet file. For example, consider a table, `contacts`, backed by parquet with the following Spark SQL schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- name: struct\r\n |    |-- first: string\r\n |    |-- last: string\r\n |-- address: string\r\n```\r\n\r\nParquet stores this table's data in three physical columns: `name.first`, `name.last` and `address`. To answer the query\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect address from contacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark will read only from the `address` column of parquet data. However, to answer the query\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect name.first from contacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark will read `name.first` and `name.last` from parquet.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies Spark SQL to support a finer-grain of schema pruning. With this patch, Spark reads only the `name.first` column to answer the previous query.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThere are two main components of this patch. First, there is a `ParquetSchemaPruning` optimizer rule for gathering the required schema fields of a `PhysicalOperation` over a parquet file, constructing a new schema based on those required fields and rewriting the plan in terms of that pruned schema. The pruned schema fields are pushed down to the parquet requested read schema. `ParquetSchemaPruning` uses a new `ProjectionOverSchema` extractor for rewriting a catalyst expression in terms of a pruned schema.\r\n\r\nSecond, the `ParquetRowConverter` has been patched to ensure the ordinals of the parquet columns read are correct for the pruned schema. `ParquetReadSupport` has been patched to address a compatibility mismatch between Spark's built in vectorized reader and the parquet-mr library's reader.\r\n\r\n### Limitation\r\n\r\nAmong the complex Spark SQL data types, this patch supports parquet column pruning of nested sequences of struct fields only.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCare has been taken to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. A more advanced version of this patch incorporating optimizations for rewriting queries involving aggregations and joins has been running on a production Spark cluster at VideoAmp for several years. In that time, one bug was found and fixed early on, and we added a regression test for that bug.\r\n\r\nWe forward-ported this patch to Spark master in June 2016 and have been running this patch against Spark 2.x branches on ad-hoc clusters since

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo workaround the issue that Spark only have statistics in logical plan, we need to create the `DataSourceReader` at logical phase so that we can report statistics. Currently this created `DataSourceReader` is kept as a `lazy val` in `DataSourceV2Relation`. If we think about how `lazy val` is implemented in Scala, we actually keep a `DataSourceReader` instance in `DataSourceV2Relation`, and exclude it when defining equality of `DataSourceV2Relation`.\r\n\r\nThis works, but have 2 problems:\r\n1. after the pushdown rule, if `DataSourceV2Relation` get transformed and return a new copy, we will re-do the pushdown and re-create the `DataSourceReader`. This is not a problem now but we may encounter such cases in the future.\r\n2. It's more intutive to put operator pushdown logic in the rule. When adding pushdown support for streaming relations, It's easier to share the pushdown code for batch and streaming data sources, if the pushdown logic is in the rule. Otherwise we may need to duplicate the pushdown logic in `StreamingDataSourceV2Relation`.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to implement the `lazy val` by ourselves: keep `DataSourceReader` as an optional parameter in the constructor of `DataSourceV2Relation`, exclude it in the equality definition but include it when copying.\r\n\r\nMoving statistics to physical plans would be best, but it's a huge topic and won't be covered in this PR.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Allows to refer a secret as an env var.\r\n* Introduces new config properties in the form: spark.kubernetes{driver,executor}.secretKeyRef.ENV_NAME=name:key\r\n  ENV_NAME is case sensitive.\r\n\r\n* Updates docs.\r\n* Adds required unit tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested and confirmed that the secrets exist in driver's and executor's container env.\r\nAlso job finished successfully. \r\nFirst created a secret with the following yaml:\r\n```\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Secret\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: test-secret\r\ndata:\r\n  username: c3RhdnJvcwo=\r\n  password: Mzk1MjgkdmRnN0pi\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n$ echo -n 'stavros' | base64\r\nc3RhdnJvcw==\r\n$ echo -n '39528$vdg7Jb' | base64\r\nMWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm\r\n```\r\nRun a job as follows:\r\n```./bin/spark-submit \\\r\n      --master k8s://http://localhost:9000 \\\r\n      --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n      --name spark-pi \\\r\n      --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \\\r\n      --conf spark.executor.instances=1 \\\r\n      --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=skonto/spark:k8envs3 \\\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now, ExpressionEncoder supports ser/de of primitive types, as well as scala case class, tuple and java bean class. Spark's Dataset natively supports these mentioned types, but we find Dataset is not flexible for other user-defined types and encoders.\r\n\r\nFor example, spark-avro has an AvroEncoder for ser/de Avro types in Dataset. Although we can use AvroEncoder to define Dataset with types being the Avro Generic or Specific Record, using such Avro typed Dataset has many limitations: \r\n1. We can not use joinWith on this Dataset since the result is a tuple, but Avro types cannot be the field of this tuple.\r\n2. We can not use some type-safe aggregation methods on this Dataset, such as KeyValueGroupedDataset's reduceGroups, since the result is also a tuple.\r\n3. We cannot augment an Avro SpecificRecord with additional primitive fields together in a case class, which we find is a very common use case.\r\n\r\nThe limitation is that ExpressionEncoder does not support serde of Scala case class/tuple with subfields being any other user-defined type with its own Encoder for serde.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we propose a trait as a contract(between ExpressionEncoder and any other user-defined Encoder) to enable case class/tuple/java bean to support user-defined types.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed patch and our minor modification in AvroEncoder, we remove above-mentioned limitations with cluster-default conf spark.expressionencoder.org.apache.avro.specific.SpecificRecord = com.databricks.spark.avro.AvroEncoder$\r\n\r\nThis is a patch we have implemented internally and has been used for a few quarters. We want to propose to upstream as we think this is a useful feature to make Dataset more flexible to user types.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have tested this patch internally. Did not write unit test since the user-defined Encoder(AvroEncoder) is defined outside Spark. \r\nI look for suggestions on how to write unit tests for this patch.\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-12T06:19:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T18:46:34Z","closed_at":"2018-09-05T01:10:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22b50fa93c6b575b3701cccb66ab0973af702d7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/547ff81e0470bed14371996da89924bfed0cc101","head":{"label":"fangshil:SPARK-24256","ref":"SPARK-24256","sha":"547ff81e0470bed14371996da89924bfed0cc101","user":{"login":"fangshil","id":2416746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTY3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2416746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil","html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":127070433,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjcwNzA0MzM=","name":"spark","full_name":"fangshil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fangshil","id":2416746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTY3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2416746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil","html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a v2 API for storage implementations to provide catalog instances to Spark. There are two parts:\r\n\r\n* `CatalogProvider` is used to instantiate and initialize catalogs via reflection, similar to data sources\r\n* `TableCatalog` provides table operations proposed in the [Table Metadata API SPIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zLFiA1VuaWeVxeTDXNg8bL6GP3BVoOZBkewFtEnjEoo/edit#)\r\n\r\nThis also adds helper classes:\r\n\r\n* `Catalogs` loads and initializes catalogs using configuration from a `SQLConf`\r\n* `CaseInsensitiveStringMap` is used to pass configuration to `CatalogProvider` via `initialize`\r\n* `PartitionTransform` is used to pass table partitioning without using `Expression`\r\n\r\nCatalogs are configured by adding config properties starting with `spark.sql.catalog.(name)`. The name property must specify a class that implements `CatalogProvider`. Other properties under the namespace (`spark.sql.catalog.(name).(prop)`) are passed to the provider during initialization.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis includes a suite for `CaseInsensitiveStringMap` and one that tests loading catalog providers.","created_at":"2018-05-11T21:21:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T19:25:35Z","closed_at":"2019-04-11T19:25:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3260fbe02946679287da6607984fce6ef3199cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b45a119df8e6382fa2503f854b4a85aed3e3785","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-24252-add-datasource-v2-catalog","ref":"SPARK-24252-add-datasource-v2-catalog","sha":"6b45a119df8e6382fa2503f854b4a85aed3e3785","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

AppendData plan for DataSourceV2 appends\r\n* AppendData is resolved if its output columns match the incoming data frame\r\n* A new analyzer rule, ResolveOutputColumns, validates data before it is appended. This rule will add safe casts, rename columns, and checks nullability\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests for v2 appends.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously in #20136 we decided to forbid tasks to access `SQLConf`, because it doesn't work and always give you the default conf value. In #21190 we fixed the check and all the places that violate it.\r\n\r\nCurrently the pattern of accessing configs at the executor side is: read the configs at the driver side, then access the variables holding the config values in the RDD closure, so that they will be serialized to the executor side. Something like\r\n```\r\nval someConf = conf.getXXX\r\nchild.execute().mapPartitions {\r\n  if (someConf == ...) ...\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this pattern is hard to apply if the config needs to be propagated via a long call stack. An example is `DataType.sameType`, and see how many changes were made in #21190 .\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to code generation, it's even worse. I tried it locally and we need to change a ton of files to propagate configs to code generators.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to allow tasks to access `SQLConf`. The idea is, we can save all the SQL configs to job properties when an SQL execution is triggered. At executor side we rebuild the `SQLConf` from job properties.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nuniVocity parser allows to specify only required column names or indexes for [parsing](https://www.univocity.com/pages/parsers-tutorial) like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Here we select only the columns by their indexes.\r\n// The parser just skips the values in other columns\r\nparserSettings.selectIndexes(4, 0, 1);\r\nCsvParser parser = new CsvParser(parserSettings);\r\n```\r\nIn this PR, I propose to extract indexes from required schema and pass them into the CSV parser. Benchmarks show the following improvements in parsing of 1000 columns:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSelect 100 columns out of 1000: x1.76\r\nSelect 1 column out of 1000: x2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: Comparing to current implementation, the changes can return different result for malformed rows in the `DROPMALFORMED` and `FAILFAST` modes if only subset of all columns is requested. To have previous behavior, set `spark.sql.csv.parser.columnPruning.enabled` to `false`.\r\n \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by new test which selects 3 columns out of 15, by existing tests and by new benchmarks.","created_at":"2018-05-10T18:56:38Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:57Z","closed_at":"2018-05-22T14:11:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cf3dd17df15fb6d14e41d60e1e2527b15c467779","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6ff6d4fda9f7e8ee43d7aa04818204de4c49440b","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:csv-column-pruning","ref":"csv-column-pruning","sha":"6ff6d4fda9f7e8ee43d7aa04818204de4c49440b","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

count to be too high in Spark, leading to an error when there were fewer than expected row groups to process. Spark should get the row groups from Parquet to pick up new filter schemes in Parquet like dictionary filtering.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsing in production at Netflix.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile reading CSV or JSON files, DataFrameReader's options are converted to Hadoop's parameters, for example there:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/DataSourceScanExec.scala#L302\r\n\r\nbut the options are not propagated to Text datasource on schema inferring, for instance:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/csv/CSVDataSource.scala#L184-L188\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes propagation of user's options to Text datasource on scheme inferring in similar way as user's options are converted to Hadoop parameters if schema is specified.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe changes were tested manually by using https://github.com/twitter/hadoop-lzo:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhadoop-lzo> mvn clean package\r\nhadoop-lzo> ln -s ./target/hadoop-lzo-0.4.21-SNAPSHOT.jar ./hadoop-lzo.jar\r\n```\r\nCreate 2 test files in JSON and CSV format and compress them:\r\n```shell\r\n$ cat test.csv\r\ncol1|col2\r\na|1\r\n$ lzop test.csv\r\n$ cat test.json\r\n{\"col1\":\"a\",\"col2\":1}\r\n$ lzop test.json\r\n```\r\nRun `spark-shell` with hadoop-lzo:\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-shell --jars ~/hadoop-lzo/hadoop-lzo.jar\r\n```\r\nreading compressed CSV and JSON without schema:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"io.compression.codecs\", \"com.hadoop.compression.lzo.LzopCodec\").option(\"inferSchema\",true).option(\"header\",true).option(\"sep\",\"|\").csv(\"test.csv.lzo\").show()\r\n+----+----+\r\n|col1|col2|\r\n+----+----+\r\n|   a|   1|\r\n+----+----+\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"io.compression.codecs\", \"com.hadoop.compression.lzo.LzopCodec\").option(\"multiLine\", true).json(\"test.json.lzo\").printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- col1: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: long (nullable = true)\r\n```","created_at":"2018-05-10T12:59:31Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:34:01Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T20:13:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10943788e7b2c3236d01ee2db65d9138585bc23c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6ab928c1abcac239f9d857d86d2e2a966f8e091","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:text-options-backport-v2.3","ref":"text-options-backport-v2.3","sha":"f6ab928c1abcac239f9d857d86d2e2a966f8e091","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLogical `Range` node has been added with `outputOrdering` recently. It's used to eliminate redundant `Sort` during optimization. However, this `outputOrdering` doesn't not propagate to physical `RangeExec` node.\r\n\r\nWe also add correct `outputPartitioning` to `RangeExec` node.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the wildcard characters (like \"?\") were in the LOAD DATA command's path name, the Path related API (hadoop and URI) couldn't parse it correctly. For example:\r\n`val srcPath = new Path(hdfsUri)` in the `tables.scala`, returned wrong result for the following cases:\r\n- `hdfsUri` = `file: /user/testdemo1/user1/t??eddata60.txt`, \r\n   `srcPath` = `file:/user/testdemo1/user1/t`\r\n- `hdfsUri` = `file:/user/testdemo1/user1/?eddata60.txt'`, \r\n   `srcPath` = `file:/user/testdemo1/user1/`\r\n(the same problem exists at `val uriPath = uri.getPath()`)\r\n\r\n The LOAD DATA LOCAL works  because the local case called a utility `Utils.resolveURI` to replaced the \"?\" to \"%3F\", then the PATH API will not truncate the file name.\r\n\r\nThis fix uses `Utils.resolveURI` method for both local and non-local cases.\r\n\r\nI did similar test on hive, it seems the hive has the same behavior.\r\n\r\n`hive> load data inpath 'hdfs:/tmp/?evin.txt' into table foo1;\r\nFAILED: SemanticException Line 1:17 Invalid path ''hdfs:/tmp/?evin.txt'': No files matching path hdfs://stcindia-node-6.fyre.ibm.com:8020/tmp/%3Fevin.txt\r\nhive> load data inpath 'hdfs:/tmp/k?evin.txt' into table foo1;\r\nFAILED: SemanticException Line 1:17 Invalid path ''hdfs:/tmp/k?evin.txt'': No files matching path hdfs://stcindia-node-6.fyre.ibm.com:8020/tmp/k%3Fevin.txt\r\nhive> \r\n`\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nDid the unit test locally, and added new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1) Currently PIC in ML displays cluster indices of nodes in the ID column. If some of the nodes there in the neighboring column, but not there in the ID column, It will not display the cluster indices corresponding to that node.\r\n\r\nAs per the definition of PIC clustering, given in the code,\r\n>  \r\nPIC takes an affinity matrix between items (or vertices) as input.  An affinity matrix\r\n is a symmetric matrix whose entries are non-negative similarities between items.\r\n PIC takes this matrix (or graph) as an adjacency matrix.  Specifically, each input row includes:\r\n - `idCol`: vertex ID\r\n  - `neighborsCol`: neighbors of vertex in `idCol`\r\n - `similaritiesCol`: non-negative weights (similarities) of edges between the vertex\r\n         in `idCol` and each neighbor in `neighborsCol`\r\n * **\"PIC returns a cluster assignment for each input vertex.\"**  It appends a new column `predictionCol`\r\n  containing the cluster assignment in `[0,k)` for each row (vertex).\r\n\r\n2) We should display prediction and id corresponding to all the nodes. So, instead of the join operation to the existing dataFrame, we can directly return the prediction-id dataFrame corresponding to all the nodes.\r\nFor the same input in spark.ml and spark.mllib, spark.mllib giving cluster id for all the vertices.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen user create a aggregator object in scala and pass the aggregator to Spark Dataset's agg() method, Spark's will initialize TypedAggregateExpression with the nodeName field as aggregator.getClass.getSimpleName. However, getSimpleName is not safe in scala environment, depending on how user creates the aggregator object. For example, if the aggregator class full qualified name is \"com.my.company.MyUtils$myAgg$2$\", the getSimpleName will throw java.lang.InternalError \"Malformed class name\". This has been reported in scalatest https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/pull/1044 and discussed in many scala upstream jiras such as SI-8110, SI-5425.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, we follow the solution in https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/pull/1044 to add safer version of getSimpleName as a util method, and TypedAggregateExpression will invoke this util method rather than getClass.getSimpleName.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nadded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI propose to bump version of uniVocity parser up to 2.6.3 where quoted empty strings are replaced by the empty value (passed to `setEmptyValue`) instead of `null` values as in the current version 2.5.9:\r\nhttps://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/blob/v2.6.3/src/main/java/com/univocity/parsers/csv/CsvParser.java#L125\r\n\r\nEmpty value for writer is set to `\"\"`. So, empty string in dataframe/dataset is stored as empty quoted string `\"\"`. Empty value for reader is set to empty string (zero size). In this way, saved empty quoted string will be read as just empty string. Please, look at the tests for more details.\r\n\r\nHere are main changes made in [2.6.0](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/releases/tag/v2.6.0), [2.6.1](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/releases/tag/v2.6.1), [2.6.2](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/releases/tag/v2.6.2), [2.6.3](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/releases/tag/v2.6.3):\r\n\r\n- CSV parser now parses quoted values ~30% faster\r\n- CSV format detection process has option provide a list of possible delimiters, in order of priority ( i.e. settings.detectFormatAutomatically( '-', '.');) - https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/issues/214\r\n- Implemented trim quoted values support - https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/issues/230\r\n- NullPointer when stopping parser when nothing is parsed - https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/issues/219\r\n- Concurrency issue when calling stopParsing() - https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/issues/231\r\n\r\nCloses #20068\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests from the PR

\"predictions\". Currently it returns the entire data, including neighborhood array and similarity array.\r\n\r\n2) Join operation to the existing dataset will skip the cluster labels of ID, which are not there in the ID column but there in the neighborhood ID column. So, instead of joining, we can directly return the \"id-prediction\" dataFrame, so that it will not skip any nodes. (This is the behavior of Spark MLLib)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a UT\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-08T20:34:32Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T20:21:34Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T20:15:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f84a965b8d1d097877f611e87cb61a422012ee7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff9e0795dbdcd6f3548ef8e6e73d805bb9b7584e","head":{"label":"shahidki31:sparkSim","ref":"sparkSim","sha":"ff9e0795dbdcd6f3548ef8e6e73d805bb9b7584e","user":{"login":"shahidki31","id":23054875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23054875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31","html_url":"https://github.com/shahidki31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104183844,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxODM4NDQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"shahidki31/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shahidki31","id":23054875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23054875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31","html_url":"https://github.com/shahidki31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shahidki31/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nWhen we run _PySpark shell with Yarn client mode_, specified `--py-files` are not recognised in _driver side_.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps I took to check:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cat /home/spark/tmp.py\r\ndef testtest():\r\n    return 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --master yarn --deploy-mode client --py-files /home/spark/tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> def test():\r\n...     import tmp\r\n...     return tmp.testtest()\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.range(1).rdd.map(lambda _: test()).collect()  # executor side\r\n[1]\r\n>>> test()  # driver side\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in test\r\nImportError: No module named tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How did it happen?\r\n\r\nUnlike Yarn cluster and client mode with Spark submit, when Yarn client mode with PySpark shell specifically,\r\n\r\n1. It first runs Python shell via:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cb82047f2f51af553df09b9323796af507d36f8/launcher/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/launcher/SparkSubmitCommandBuilder.java#L158 as pointed out by @tgravescs in the JIRA.\r\n\r\n2. this triggers shell.py and submit another application to launch a py4j gateway:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/209b9361ac8a4410ff797cff1115e1888e2f7e66/python/pyspark/java_gateway.py#L45-L60\r\n\r\n3. it runs a Py4J gateway:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cb82047f2f51af553df09b9323796af507d36f8/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L425\r\n\r\n4. it copies (or downloads) --py-files  into local temp directory:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cb82047f2f51af553df09b9323796af507d36f8/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L365-L376\r\n\r\nand then these files are set up to `spark.submit.pyFiles`\r\n\r\n5. Py4J JVM is launched and then the Python paths are set via:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7013eea11cb32b1e0038dc751c485da5c94a484b/python/pyspark/context.py#L209-L216\r\n\r\nHowever, these are not actually set because those files were copied into a tmp directory in 4. whereas this code path looks for `SparkFiles.getRootDirectory` where the files are stored only when `SparkContext.addFile()` is called.\r\n\r\nIn other cluster mode, `spark.files` are set via:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cb82047f2f51af553df09b9323796af507d36f8/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L554-L555\r\n\r\nand those files are explicitly added via:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ecb8b383af1cf1b67f3111c148229e00c9c17c40/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.scala#L395\r\n\r\nSo we are fine in other modes.\r\n\r\nIn case of Yarn client and cluster with _submit_, these are manually being handled. In particular https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/6360 added most of the logics. In this case, the Python path looks manually set via, for example, `deploy.PythonRunner`. We don't use `spark.files` here. \r\n\r\n### How does the PR fix the problem?\r\n\r\nI tried to make an isolated approach as possible as I can: simply copy py file or zip files into `SparkFiles.getRootDirectory()` in driver side if not existing. Another possible way is to set `spark.files` but it does unnecessary stuff together and sounds a bit invasive.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> def test():\r\n...     import tmp\r\n...     return tmp.testtest()\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.range(1).rdd.map(lambda _: test()).collect()\r\n[1]\r\n>>> test()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in test\r\nImportError: No module named tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> def test():\r\n...     import tmp\r\n...     return tmp.testtest()\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.range(1).rdd.map(lambda _: test()).collect()\r\n[1]\r\n>>> test()\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested in standalone and yarn cluster with PySpark shell. .zip and .py files were also tested with the similar steps above. It's difficult to add a test.","created_at":"2018-05-08T08:11:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:43:45Z","closed_at":"2018-05-17T04:12:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"98335326529c51f50221bdb9c269df9f0a790128","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21267/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21267/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21267/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef3555e389ea36159e9a1dfd076e9f6afbaf3f35","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-21945","ref":"SPARK-21945","sha":"ef3555e389ea36159e9a1dfd076e9f6afbaf3f35","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis removes `PruneFileSourcePartitions` and moves projection and filter push-down to `DataSourceV2Strategy`. This accomplishes the same goal as #21230 and only runs the push-down once by not using `transformUp` to traverse the plan.\r\n\r\nUnlike #21230, this moves pushdown to the v2 strategy to match the way pushdown happens for other code paths: when creating a physical plan from a logical plan. This was suggested by @marmbrus in #20387, but not implemented at the time. The same concern from that PR still applies to this commit: **pushdown is not applied until conversion to a physical plan, so `computeStats` can't report stats after filtering or projecting**.\r\n\r\nA benefit of this approach is that the `DataSourceV2Relation` is simpler and the relation's `output` is constant.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis uses existing tests.","created_at":"2018-05-08T00:00:31Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T18:06:39Z","closed_at":"2018-06-26T18:06:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90a2232e60be389562866e1c3a8d88474e627bd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7497cc2308136ded913b3745b9232487a949804a","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-24172-v2-pushdown-in-strategy","ref":"SPARK-24172-v2-pushdown-in-strategy","sha":"7497cc2308136ded913b3745b9232487a949804a","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

PR continues #21095 and intersects with #21238. I've added volume mounts as a separate step and added PersistantVolumeClaim support. \r\n\r\nThere is a fundamental problem with how we pass the options through spark conf to fabric8. For each volume type and all possible volume options we would have to implement some custom code to map config values to fabric8 calls. This will result in big body of code we would have to support and means that Spark will always be somehow out of sync with k8s.\r\n\r\nI think there needs to be a discussion on how to proceed correctly (eg use PodPreset instead)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nDue to the complications of provisioning and managing actual resources this PR addresses only volume mounting of already present

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Apache Spark 2.4, [SPARK-23355](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23355) fixes a bug which ignores table properties during `convertMetastore` for tables created by `STORED AS ORC/PARQUET`.\r\n\r\nFor some Parquet tables having table properties like `TBLPROPERTIES (parquet.compression 'NONE')`, it was ignored by default before Apache Spark 2.4. After upgrading cluster, Spark will write uncompressed file which is different from Apache Spark 2.3 and old.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide full backward-compatibility, this introduces additional configuration `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreTableProperty` to restore the previous behavior by ignoring table properties.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR adds the SQL function `map_from_arrays`. The behavior of the function is based on Presto's `map`. Since SparkSQL already had a `map` function, we prepared the different name for this behavior.\r\n\r\nThis function returns returns a map from a pair of arrays for keys and values.\r\n\r\n## How was

In addition, this patch changes the behavior of when and which resolution files are cleaned to prevent accumulation of resolution files in the default ivy cache dir.\r\n\r\nSince this PR is a successor of #18801, close #18801.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, restrictions in JSONOptions for `encoding` and `lineSep` are the same for read and for write. For example, a requirement for `lineSep` in the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf.write.option(\"encoding\", \"UTF-32BE\").json(file)\r\n```\r\ndoesn't allow to skip `lineSep` and use its default value `\\n` because it throws the exception:\r\n```\r\nequirement failed: The lineSep option must be specified for the UTF-32BE encoding\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: The lineSep option must be specified for the UTF-32BE encoding\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to separate JSONOptions in read and write, and make JSONOptions in write less restrictive.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test for blacklisted encodings in read.

of always throwing a generic exception when the AM fails,\r\nprint a generic error and throw the exception with the YARN\r\ndiagnostics containing the reason for the failure.\r\n\r\nThere was an issue with YARN sometimes providing a generic diagnostic\r\nmessage, even though the AM provides a failure reason when\r\nunregistering. That was happening because the AM was registering\r\ntoo late, and if errors happened before the registration, YARN would\r\njust create a generic \"ExitCodeException\" which wasn't very helpful.\r\n\r\nSince most errors in this path are a result of not being able to\r\nconnect to the driver, this change modifies the AM registration\r\na bit so that the AM is registered before the connection to the\r\ndriver is established. That way, errors are properly propagated\r\nthrough YARN back to the driver.\r\n\r\nAs part of that, I also removed the code that retried connections\r\nto the driver from the client AM. At that point, the driver should\r\nalready be up and waiting for connections, so it's unlikely that\r\nretrying would help - and in case it does, that means a flaky\r\nnetwork, which would mean problems would probably show up again.\r\nThe effect of that is that connection-related errors are reported\r\nback to the driver much faster now (through the YARN report).\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that there seems to be a race on the YARN\r\nside that causes a report to be sent to the client without the\r\ncorresponding diagnostics string from the AM; the diagnostics are\r\navailable later from the RM web page. For that reason, the generic\r\nerror messages are kept in the Spark scheduler code, to help\r\nguide users to a way of debugging their failure.\r\n\r\nAlso of note is that if YARN's max attempts configuration is lower\r\nthan Spark's, Spark will not unregister the AM with a proper\r\ndiagnostics message. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to\r\nunregister the AM and still allow further re-attempts to happen.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n- existing unit tests\r\n- some of our integration tests\r\n- hardcoded an invalid driver address in the code and verified\r\n  the error in the shell. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> 18/05/04 15:09:34 ERROR cluster.YarnClientSchedulerBackend: YARN application has exited unexpectedly with state FAILED! Check the YARN application logs for more details.\r\n18/05/04 15:09:34 ERROR cluster.YarnClientSchedulerBackend: Diagnostics message: Uncaught exception: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Exception thrown in awaitResult:\r\n  <AM stack trace>\r\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: Failed to connect to localhost/127.0.0.1:1234\r\n  <More stack

Please refer to [Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nyW0T0b_ajUduQoPgZLAsyHK8s3_dko3ulQuxaLpUXE) for design.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport aggregates with exactly 1 partition in continuous processing.\r\n\r\nA few small tweaks are needed to make this work:\r\n\r\n* Replace currentEpoch tracking with an ThreadLocal. This means that current epoch is scoped to a task rather than a node, but I think that's sustainable even once we add shuffle.\r\n* Add a new testing-only flag to disable the UnsupportedOperationChecker whitelist of allowed continuous processing nodes. I think this is preferable to writing a pile of custom logic to enforce that there is in fact only 1 partition; we plan to support multi-partition aggregates before the next Spark release, so we'd just have to tear that logic back out.\r\n* Restart continuous processing queries from the first available uncommitted epoch, rather than one that's guaranteed to be unused. This is required for stateful operators to overwrite partial state from the previous attempt at the epoch, and there was no specific motivation for the original strategy. In another PR before stabilizing the StreamWriter API, we'll need to narrow down and document more precise semantic guarantees for the epoch IDs.\r\n* We need a single-partition ContinuousMemoryStream. The way MemoryStream is constructed means it can't be a text option like it is for rate source, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew unit tests","created_at":"2018-05-04T22:17:04Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T17:30:11Z","closed_at":"2018-05-15T17:30:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8c08cfb525522cc42312a3ab314af531b2403c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/41577c35a7c59ffcf48225fbc30b0dc3c8cab674","head":{"label":"jose-torres:withAggr","ref":"withAggr","sha":"41577c35a7c59ffcf48225fbc30b0dc3c8cab674","user":{"login":"jose-torres","id":30604243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjA0MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30604243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres","html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":98938104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5ODkzODEwNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jose-torres/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jose-torres","id":30604243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjA0MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30604243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres","html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDrastically improves performance and won't cause Spark applications to fail because they write too much data to the Docker image's specific file system. The file system's directories that back emptydir volumes are generally larger and more performant.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHas been in use via the prototype version of Kubernetes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #21210 because `branch-2.2` also faces the same failures.\r\n\r\nAlthough [SPARK-22654](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22654) made `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` download from Apache mirrors three times, it has been flaky because it didn't verify the downloaded file. Some Apache mirrors terminate the downloading abnormally, the *corrupted* file shows the following errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngzip: stdin: not in gzip format\r\ntar: Child returned status 1\r\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\r\n22:46:32.700 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite: \r\n\r\n===== POSSIBLE THREAD LEAK IN SUITE o.a.s.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite, thread names: Keep-Alive-Timer =====\r\n\r\n*** RUN ABORTED ***\r\n  java.io.IOException: Cannot run program \"./bin/spark-submit\" (in directory \"/tmp/test-spark/spark-2.2.0\"): error=2, No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has been reported weirdly in two ways. For example, the above case is reported as Case 2 `no failures`.\r\n\r\n- Case 1. [Test Result (1 failure / +1)](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7/4389/)\r\n- Case 2.

If it turns out that the file is empty or corrupted, `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` will do retry logic like the download failure.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `PushDownOperatorsToDataSource`, we use `transformUp` to match `PhysicalOperation` and apply pushdown. This is problematic if we have multiple `Filter` and `Project` above the data source v2 relation.\r\n\r\ne.g. for a query\r\n```\r\nProject\r\n  Filter\r\n    DataSourceV2Relation\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe pattern match will be triggered twice and we will do operator pushdown twice. This is unnecessary, we can use `mapChildren` to only apply pushdown once.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt's possible that Accumulators of Spark 1.x may no longer work with Spark 2.x. This is because `LegacyAccumulatorWrapper.isZero` may return wrong answer if `AccumulableParam` doesn't define equals/hashCode.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by using reference equality check in

store string data in one big byte array. Since the array size is capped at just under Integer.MAX_VALUE, a single `ColumnVector` cannot store more than 2GB of string data.\r\nBut since the Parquet files commonly contain large blobs stored as strings, and `ColumnVector`s by default carry 4096 values, it's entirely possible to go past that limit. In such cases a negative capacity is requested from `WritableColumnVector.reserve()`. The call succeeds (requested capacity is smaller than already allocated capacity), and consequently `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown when the reader actually attempts to put the data into the array.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a simple check for integer overflow to `WritableColumnVector.reserve()` which should help catch the error earlier and provide more informative exception. Additionally, the error message in `WritableColumnVector.throwUnsupportedException()` was corrected.\r\n\r\nNew units tests were added.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Ala Luszczak <ala@databricks.com>\r\n\r\nCloses
