rule F401`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-import)\r\n# unused-import (F401)\r\n\r\nDerived from the **Pyflakes** linter.\r\n\r\nFix is sometimes available.\r\n\r\n## What it does\r\nChecks for unused imports.\r\n\r\n## Why is this bad?\r\nUnused imports add a performance overhead at runtime, and risk creating\r\nimport cycles. They also increase the cognitive load of reading the code.\r\n\r\nIf an import statement is used to check for the availability or existence\r\nof a module, consider using `importlib.util.find_spec` instead.\r\n\r\nIf an import statement is used to re-export a symbol as part of a module's\r\npublic interface, consider using a \"redundant\" import alias, which\r\ninstructs Ruff (and other tools) to respect the re-export, and avoid\r\nmarking it as unused, as in:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom module import member as member\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use `__all__` to declare a symbol as part of the module's\r\ninterface, as in:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# __init__.py\r\nimport some_module\r\n\r\n__all__ = [\"some_module\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fix safety\r\n\r\nFixes to remove unused imports are safe, except in `__init__.py` files.\r\n\r\nApplying fixes to `__init__.py` files is currently in preview. The fix offered depends on the\r\ntype of the unused import. Ruff will suggest a safe fix to export first-party imports with\r\neither a redundant alias or, if already present in the file, an `__all__` entry. If multiple\r\n`__all__` declarations are present, Ruff will not offer a fix. Ruff will suggest an unsafe fix\r\nto remove third-party and standard library imports -- the fix is unsafe because the module's\r\ninterface changes.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np  # unused import\r\n\r\n\r\ndef area(radius):\r\n    return 3.14 * radius**2\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse instead:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef area(radius):\r\n    return 3.14 * radius**2\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo check the availability of a module, use `importlib.util.find_spec`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom importlib.util import find_spec\r\n\r\nif find_spec(\"numpy\") is not None:\r\n    print(\"numpy is installed\")\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"numpy is not installed\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n- `lint.ignore-init-module-imports`\r\n- `lint.pyflakes.allowed-unused-imports`\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- [Python documentation: `import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement)\r\n- [Python documentation: `importlib.util.find_spec`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.find_spec)\r\n- [Typing documentation: interface conventions](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/libraries.html#library-interface-public-and-private-symbols)\r\n\r\n### Fix <bug description or the bug issue number or bug issue link>\r\n- [ ] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works.\r\n- [x] Explain briefly why the bug exists and how to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Improve the performance of <class or module or ...>\r\n- [ ] Add a benchmark for the improvement, refer to [the existing ones](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/apm-commons/apm-datacarrier/src/test/java/org/apache/skywalking/apm/commons/datacarrier/LinkedArrayBenchmark.java)\r\n- [ ] The benchmark result.\r\n```text\r\n<Paste the benchmark results here>\r\n```\r\n- [x] Links/URLs to the theory proof or discussion articles/blogs. <links/URLs here>\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### <Feature description>\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [ ] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [ ] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [ ] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n     ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.
