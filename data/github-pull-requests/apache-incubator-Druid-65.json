(This is the main change.)\r\n- Query: Add \"getSubQueryId\" and \"withSubQueryId\" methods.\r\n- QueryMetrics: Add \"subQueryId\" dimension.\r\n- ServerConfig: Add new \"maxSubqueryRows\" parameter, which is used b y ClientQuerySegmentWalker to limit how many rows can be inlined per query.\r\n- IndexedTableJoinMatcher: Allow creating keys on top of unknown types, by assuming they are strings. This is useful because not all types are known for fields in query results.\r\n- InlineDataSource: Store RowSignature rather than component parts. Add more zealous \"equals\" and \"hashCode\" methods to ease testing.\r\n- Moved QuerySegmentWalker test code from CalciteTests and SpecificSegmentsQueryWalker in druid-sql to QueryStackTests in druid-server. Use this to spin up a new ClientQuerySegmentWalkerTest.","created_at":"2020-03-18T05:24:42Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T22:33:39Z","closed_at":"2020-03-18T22:06:46Z","merged_at":"2020-03-18T22:06:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ef25a438fd9456f40f2adb36549eeaf86fef4f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

PR adjusts the join filter rewrite/pushdown logic in `JoinFilterAnalyzer` to avoid redundant computation/memory waste for filter analysis information that's common across segments (converting filters to conjunctive normal form, and determining + storing correlated values for filter rewrites). \r\n\r\nA new `computeJoinFilterPreAnalysis` method has been added which handles the computations described above (called once per query on each node). The result of this method is passed to the `splitFilters` method (called once per segment).\r\n\r\nThe pre-analysis step is called in `Joinables.createSegmentMapFn`.\r\n\r\nTwo new query context parameters are added:\r\n- `enableJoinFilterRewriteValueColumnFilters` : Controls whether we rewrite RHS filters on non-key columns. False by default for performance reasons, since rewriting such filters requires a scan of the RHS table.\r\n- `joinFilterRewriteMaxSize`: Controls the maximum size of the correlated value set used for filter rewrites. This limit is used to prevent excessive memory use. The default limit is 10000.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.","created_at":"2020-03-14T00:31:50Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:15:30Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T05:16:15Z","merged_at":"2020-03-17T05:16:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1847364b0816cfc3c2ac376cd888033a06fb93f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

the option to start Hadoop docker container when running integration tests\r\n\r\nHadoop docker container can easily be start when running any integration test by passing in the -Dstart.hadoop.docker=true\r\nBy default Hadoop container is not build nor start.\r\nHadoop docker container is build and setup by the same scripts that is use in our examples/quickstart/tutorial/hadoop/docker for the following reasons:\r\n1) Only maintains one set of Hadoop docker build/setup/startup scripts.\r\n2)  We should be able to easily test against what we give Druid user in our docs/tutorial and make sure they always work to ensure a pleasant user experience. \r\n\r\nTested and verified to be working:\r\nUse the -Dstart.hadoop.docker=true when running mvn to bring the Hadoop container up (this will setup all the xml, env, hadoop-dependencies, etc.).\r\nOnce it is up, I can submit ingestion task to druid running in the other container which then submit map/reduce to the Hadoop container and ingest data successfully.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [

#6739.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR adds an additional set of `SeekableStreamSupervisor` lag metrics, based on time in millis behind the latest offsets of the stream, allowing the Kinesis indexing service extension to have a lag metric. `scheduleReporting ` and `emitLag` were pushed down from `KafkaSupervisor` into `SeekableStreamSupervisor`, and two additional abstract methods, `getPartitionRecordLag` and `getPartitionTimeLag` which collect the two types of lag metrics per partition of the stream.\r\n\r\nKafka's existing lag metrics are still collected in the same format for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n```\r\ningest/{supervisor type}/lag\r\ningest/{supervisor type}/maxLag\r\ningest/{supervisor type}/avgLag\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the new time metrics have a `/time` suffix.\r\n\r\n```\r\ningest/{supervisor type}/lag/time\r\ningest/{supervisor type}/maxLag/time\r\ningest/{supervisor type}/avgLag/time\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently `KafkaSupervisor` only emits the former set of metrics, and `KinesisSupervisor`, after this PR, will emit only the latter. It seems possible for `KafkaSupervisor` to emit both sets of metrics, but I will save that for a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nLag is also available on the supervisor status reports:\r\n\r\nexample kinesis supervisor status report:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"clint-test-kinesis\",\r\n  \"stream\": \"clint-test\",\r\n  \"partitions\": 1,\r\n  \"replicas\": 1,\r\n  \"durationSeconds\": 3600,\r\n  \"activeTasks\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"index_kinesis_clint-test-kinesis_0dbe7907dfdf424_omdghmmd\",\r\n      \"startingOffsets\": {\r\n        \"shardId-000000000000\": \"49605075714895969944729166984744978015226161388004048898\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"startTime\": null,\r\n      \"remainingSeconds\": null,\r\n      \"type\": \"ACTIVE\",\r\n      \"currentOffsets\": {},\r\n      \"lag\": {},\r\n      \"lagMillis\": {\r\n        \"shardId-000000000000\": 86244000\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"publishingTasks\": [],\r\n  \"minimumLagMillis\": {\r\n    \"shardId-000000000000\": 86243000\r\n  },\r\n  \"aggregateLagMillis\": 86243000,\r\n  \"suspended\": false,\r\n  \"healthy\": true,\r\n  \"state\": \"RUNNING\",\r\n  \"detailedState\": \"RUNNING\",\r\n  \"recentErrors\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nexample status report with suspended supervisor:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"clint-test-kinesis\",\r\n  \"stream\": \"clint-test\",\r\n  \"partitions\": 1,\r\n  \"replicas\": 1,\r\n  \"durationSeconds\": 3600,\r\n  \"activeTasks\": [],\r\n  \"publishingTasks\": [],\r\n  \"minimumLagMillis\": {\r\n    \"shardId-000000000000\": 22463000\r\n  },\r\n  \"aggregateLagMillis\": 22463000,\r\n  \"suspended\": true,\r\n  \"healthy\": true,\r\n  \"state\": \"SUSPENDED\",\r\n  \"detailedState\": \"SUSPENDED\",\r\n  \"recentErrors\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

split this out from another patch I'm working on that allows the broker to inline subqueries (see https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8728). In that patch it became clear that `QueryToolChest#resultArrayFields` really should return type info as well. I started using a `Map<String, ValueType>` for that, as is done in a few other places in the code, but then realized that it would be better to use the RowSignature class from druid-sql. So I moved it into druid-processing in the following way.\r\n\r\n1) Moved (most of) RowSignature from sql to processing. Left behind the SQL-specific\r\n   stuff in a RowSignatures utility class. It also picked up some new convenience\r\n   methods along the way.\r\n2) There were a lot of places in the code where Map<String, ValueType> was used to\r\n   associate columns with type info. These are now all replaced with RowSignature.\r\n3) QueryToolChest's resultArrayFields method is replaced with resultArraySignature,\r\n   and it now provides type info.\r\n\r\nThis patch will unblock a future subquery inlining patch.","created_at":"2020-03-12T07:39:31Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:15:46Z","closed_at":"2020-03-12T18:06:45Z","merged_at":"2020-03-12T18:06:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff59d2e78bd3949e46858bc2f9882db9a7d2a186","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Path Towards #9053\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new configuration property `druid.zk.service.enabled=true/false, default =  true` on all nodes to disable all of zookeeper activities that get setup even if user chooses to use HTTP based segment and  task management. Some of those are....\r\n\r\n- historical announcing itself as data server in zk\r\n- historicals watching zk for segment load/drop requests\r\n- historicals announcing segments in zk\r\n- middle managers watching zk for task assignment requests\r\n- middle managers doing task status updates in zk\r\n(above set of things are required, so that curator based task/segment management continues to work in rolling deployment scenario and also could be interchanged with http based task/segment management at any time)\r\n- HttpRemoteTaskRunner periodically doing cleanup of tasks from zk because MiddleManager continues to update the status in zk\r\n- external discovery announcements done via `ServiceAnnouncer` to keep tranquility working\r\n\r\nThis property is undocumented for now till k8s based discovery extension PR shows up, that will have all the necessary documentation including setting `druid.zk.service.enabled=false` .\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ZkEnabledmentConfig`\r\n * `CliXXX`\r\n *

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to #9407 that adds a new interface `QueryPrioritizationStrategy` intended to enable implementations to automatically prioritize queries based on some criteria. As a proof of concept implementation of this functionality, it provides `ThresholdBasedQueryDeprioritizationStrategy`, which offers the 3 thresholds of: period from the current time of the query, duration of the interval of the query, and number of segments taking part in the query, described in #6993.\r\n\r\nThis strategy can be enabled by setting `druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.strategy` to `threshold`.\r\n\r\n|Property|Description|Default|\r\n|--------|-----------|-------|\r\n|`druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.periodThreshold`|ISO duration threshold for how old data can be queried before automatically adjusting query priority.|None|\r\n|`druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.durationThreshold`|ISO duration threshold for maximum duration a queries interval can span before the priority is automatically adjusted.|None|\r\n|`druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.segmentCountThreshold`|Number threshold for maximum number of segments that can take part in a query before its priority is automatically adjusted.|None|\r\n|`druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.adjustment`|Amount to reduce the priority of queries which cross any threshold.|None|\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of #6993, and a follow-up to #9407 which adds a `ManualLaningStrategy` that in addition to being useful to make it easy to add an integration test for the query laning functionality, is also well suited for cases where one or more external applications which query Druid are able to manually decide which lane a query belongs to by adding a `lane` parameter to the query context.\r\n\r\nexample config:\r\n```\r\ndruid.query.scheduler.laning.strategy=manual\r\ndruid.query.scheduler.laning.isLimitPercent=true\r\ndruid.query.scheduler.laning.lanes.ten=10\r\ndruid.query.scheduler.laning.lanes.twenty=20\r\ndruid.query.scheduler.laning.lanes.fifty=50\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example defines 3 lanes, \"ten\", \"twenty\", and \"fifty\", which if the query context contains that lane name will be allowed to use up to 10%, 20%, or 50% of the total capacity.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nThe native filter is way faster than the expression filter. Here is a `ExpressionFilterBenchmark` result.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                   (rowsPerSegment)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nExpressionFilterBenchmark.expressionFilter           1000000  avgt   30  255.291 Â± 1.034  ms/op\r\nExpressionFilterBenchmark.nativeFilter               1000000  avgt   30    1.868 Â± 0.005  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optimization that transforms `array_contains()` and `array_overlaps()` into native filters if possible. For now, the optimization will be applied only when their parameters are a simple extraction and a literal. This is because the facility that traverses an `Expr` tree and converts it to a tree of native filters is missing. I think we could possibly add an optimization layer on the native query or between the sql layer and the native query layer, but it's not in the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\nI also added the behavior of the `IN` filter on multi-valued dimensions in the doc.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x]

a factory for OnHeapMemorySegmentWriteOutMedium to support direct writing via Spark.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs part of the ongoing discussions on the Druid dev list, Slack channels, and other fora (including #9342), there appears to be significant community desire for writing directly from Spark to Druid. In order to support this, we should expose the ability to write segments using on-heap memory. While less efficient than using off-heap memory, on-heap memory is much easier to manage in Spark and common resource managers (e.g. YARN, Mesos, etc.). This factory is almost exactly the same as the existing OffHeapMemorySegmentWriteOutMediumFactory, with OnHeapMemorySegmentWriteOutMedium substituted for OffHeapMemorySegmentWriteOutMedium.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

issue uncovered in #9412.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAs an optimization added in #6902, Druid SQL re-uses the same expression virtual column whenever possible when constructing a native query, to take advantage of things like the caching selectors, etc.\r\n\r\nThese virtual columns are translated into `DimensionExpression` when taking part in a grouping, using the virtual column name as the output name and the input dimension on the resulting `DimensionSpec`. However, if 2 dimensions taking part in a grouping were using the same expression, the output signature would incorrectly duplicate the expression causing an error of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE: Duplicate field name: v0\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.rel.Grouping.<init>(Grouping.java:71)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.rel.Grouping.create(Grouping.java:100)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.rel.DruidQuery.computeGrouping(DruidQuery.java:346)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.rel.DruidQuery.fromPartialQuery(DruidQuery.java:193)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.rel.PartialDruidQuery.build(PartialDruidQuery.java:306)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by checking for repeated usage of virtual columns in dimensions, and uses normal dimension output names rather than the virtual column name in case a duplicate is encountered. The added test and modified existing tests illustrate the effects of the new behavior.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests

is an effort to revive #6493 , which seemed to have fizzled out some time ago.

Description\r\nInitial piece of #6993, adding basic query laning facilities for capacity enforcement. Note that to keep things simpler to review, this PR does not include automatic prioritization, this will be [done in a follow-up PR that builds on top of this branch](https://github.com/clintropolis/druid/compare/query-laning-and-load-shedding...clintropolis:query-auto-prioritization).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the concept of query lanes, and using them as a mean to control capacity allotments to 'classes' of queries. Based on the vivid discussion in #6993, a `QueryLaningStrategy` interface has been introduced to try and ensure this foundation is appropriately expressive for the variety of strategies discussed in that PR.\r\n\r\nTo make this happen, an opinionated stance has been taken on the purpose of `QueryManager`, which has been renamed `QueryScheduler`. `QueryScheduler`, in addition to continuing to provide cancellation facilities of `QueryManager`, is now also responsible for enforcing lane limits, by computing what lane a query belongs to with the help of the configured `QueryLaningStrategy`, and trying to acquire a semaphore. If available, query processing proceeds, otherwise a new `QueryCapacityExceededException` is thrown, which currently is mapped to an HTTP `429` response code (instead of 503 for the reasons discussed in #6993) by the `QueryResource` and `SqlResource` endpoints.\r\n\r\nThe lane assignment is happens on the broker, in `CachingClusteredClient` so that the laning strategy has access to the number of segments taking part in the query as well as the pool of servers available to query for those segments.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of concept, two initial laning strategies are included in this PR, a 'No laning strategy' which does nothing and behaves as the current behavior of the only limit being the size of the HTTP thread pool, and a 'High/Low' laning strategy, which classes any query with a `priority` set in the query context less than 0 to be in the 'low' lane.\r\n\r\nThe lane semaphores are provided through [resilience4j-bulkhead](https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/bulkhead), which simplified the code a bit compared to the map of semaphores my initial prototype relied on, but functionally appears to have little difference. I encountered this library from #8357, which proposes using an alternative library, [concurrency-limits](https://github.com/Netflix/concurrency-limits) which is very interesting, but I was worried about the initial complexity of using measurement based dynamic limits for the lane enforcement.\r\n\r\nI do think this is worth exploring in the future, either strictly for total capacity enforcement or for more I am currently unsure. [`AbstractPartitionedLimiter`](https://github.com/Netflix/concurrency-limits/blob/master/concurrency-limits-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/concurrency/limits/limiter/AbstractPartitionedLimiter.java) seems very close to what we might want to enforce laning, but it provides a slightly different _at least_ guarantee than the _at most_ guarantee that this PR is currently providing, where I feel the _at most_ works a bit better with our fixed Jetty thread pool size. However, since lane limit enforcement is entirely contained within `QueryScheduler`, it is likely not a ton of effort to switch libraries if we find in the future that we can get better behavior with `concurrency-limits`, just as I swapped from my map of `Semaphore` to using `BulkheadRegistry`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why not QosFilter\r\nJetty has a `QoSFilter` which almost provided the machinery required for the total capacity enforcement, but logically does not occur late enough to have sufficient information to be able to perform some of the decisions desired in #6993, particularly with regards to things like number of segments or information about which servers are available to take part in a query, which required being further down in CachingClusteredClient closer to where the actual query stuffs are happening.\r\n\r\n### Follow-up improvements\r\n\r\n#### Manual laning and end to end integration tests\r\nA query lane is just a query context property, so allowing a custom static lane limit configuration is a low effort follow-up that could probably support a lot of simple custom capacity planning solutions, and easier testing of this functionality in integration tests. https://github.com/clintropolis/druid/compare/query-laning-and-load-shedding...clintropolis:manual-query-laning\r\n\r\n#### Automatic prioritization\r\nThe other half of #6993, I want to follow-up this PR immediately with another that will add in the threshold based automatic prioritization described in the design document.\r\nhttps://github.com/clintropolis/druid/compare/query-laning-and-load-shedding...clintropolis:query-auto-prioritization\r\n\r\n#### Lane based TierSelectorStrategy\r\nPart of the motivation for laning is providing Druid with the means to avoid the necessity to run multiple pools of brokers. One of the reasons this is currently done is to have separate pools of Brokers which have differently configured tier selection strategies to router different types of queries to reduce historical contention (`druid.broker.select.tier`, etc). By extending `QueryLaningStrategy` to allow fetching a `TierSelectorStrategy`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```  \r\nTierSelectorStrategy getTierSelectorStrategy(Query<T> query);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich the brokers `CachingClusteredClient` could use along with a lightly modified `ServerSelector` that allows providing a `TierSelectorStrategy` to the `pick` method in order to override the default broker configuration.\r\n\r\n#### Tier based laning\r\n \r\nAdding a new `TieredQueryLaningStrategy` to allow capacity control based on the historical tier that a query will be routed to, for scenarios where historical tiers serve disjoint intervals or datasources. This is to serve as a partial replacement/alternative to `druid.router.tierToBrokerMap`, which allows a Druid router to route queries to different pools of Druid brokers based on what tier a query belongs to, allowing partitioning of queries between different pools of resources. Instead, this will be able to be done within a single broker pool, reserving capacity for queries going to each lane.\r\n\r\n#### Better utilization and automatic cancellation of lower priority queries\r\n\r\nThe initial solution will introduce an under-utilization problem, if _all_ queries are low priority they will still be limited by the lane limits. Longer term, we should be able to utilize the entire HTTP thread pool with any lane of query, and cancel them when higher priority lanes come in.\r\n\r\n#### Lane limit enforcement on historicals and peons/indexers\r\n\r\nEverything will already have a `QueryScheduler` as of this PR, because it is the only implementation of `QueryWatcher`, we just need to wire a call to `run` into these services to allow them to enforce these limits as well. On the broker side, we will want to watch for these responses and cancel the query for over-running capacity.\r\n\r\n#### Adaptive limits\r\n\r\nThe current iteration of this PR is going to require a bunch of calculations to figure out what the correct lane limits are for a given cluster size. Longer term, it would be nice for these to be  adaptively computed to adjust lane limits to be higher or lower based on cluster size and/or back-pressure from historicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Processing pool enhancements\r\n\r\nWith lane limits in place, we can explore additional options for how the processing pool functions such as exploring preemption of lower priority queries by higher priority lanes. Using the existing priorities, lower priority queries can already experience starvation, but this becomes greatly exaggerated if the processing pool allows preempting the per segment results. But with lane limits in place, we can ensure that the per query resources such as the HTTP thread pools cannot be overrun by starving low priority queries.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

check for isNull and getting a primitive for the IndexedTableColumnValueSelector is almost identical.\r\n\r\nIn several places throughout the code, selectors explicitly check if a value is null before getting the value. So the IndexedTableColumnValueSelector does double the work here. This change makes it so that the value is cached across calls.\r\n\r\nIn local performance tests, the improvement on small segments (~ 100K) was within the margin of error on my laptop.\r\n\r\nFlamegraphs collected show that less time is being spent in getting the value from the selector,\r\nhowever the selector still needs to convert the raw object to the primitive type. This is where\r\nthe selector spends most of it's time now. The primitive / object conversion appears to be a problem across other parts of the query interface as well.\r\n\r\nTrying to add support for primitives across this interface seemed like too large of a change to take on at this point in

Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThe [current documentation](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/index.html#static-configuration) on coordinator kill tasks is open to more than one interpretation of what segments are being deleted.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nThis patch makes minor changes to the documentation, clarifying that the kill tasks enabled though `druid.coordinator.kill.on` only delete unused segments.\r\n\r\nThis is my understanding.

I just think it is worth clarifying.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added

Description\r\n\r\n`druid.coordinator.kill.pendingSegments.on` is to clean up stale entries in the `pendingSegments` table in the metadata store.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new method to the `Expr` interface, `Expr.stringify()`. which produces _parseable_ expression strings so that any `Expr` tree can be converted back into a `String` which can later be parsed into an equivalent expression.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, not all `Expr` which could exist at evaluation time were actually parseable, specifically empty numeric arrays and arrays with null elements. To make all `Expr` able to satisfy the `stringify` contract, the grammar has been updated to support these constructs. Empty arrays may now be defined like so: `<STRING>[]`, `<DOUBLE>[]`, `<LONG>[]`, and arrays like `[null, 1, 2]` are now able to be correctly parsed from an expression string. The explicit typing syntax for arrays extends beyond empty arrays, so things like `<LONG>[1, 2, 3]` are also valid (and equivalent to `[1, 2, 3]`).\r\n\r\nFor testing, I modified the majority of expression unit tests assertions to also ensure that parsing the stringified form of a parsed expression produces the same results with and without flattening, so that nearly every expression that is tested also tests round tripping back to string.\r\n\r\nTagged with design review to discuss syntax for the empty arrays.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Expr.java`\r\n * `Expr.g4`\r\n *

#9327 and #9328 \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #9327 by calling `getBindingIfIdentifier` on the expressions that appear in join equiconditions instead of `getIdentifierIfIdentifier` when creating the `Equality` objects.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #9328 by adjusting `JoinFilterAnalyzer`:\r\n- The equicondition map now uses `Set<Expr>` for its values\r\n- Uses a Set instead of List for the rhsColumns in `findCorrelatedBaseTableColumns` to avoid duplicates\r\n- `findCorrelatedBaseTableColumns` has been adjusted to handle the mappings of RHS columns to expression sets, instead of just single

Description\r\n\r\nFor now, the Parallel task creates a sub task per input file. This could be not very efficient when you have lots of small files because each task has an overhead for scheduling, JVM startup, etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `MaxSizeSplitHintSpec` and allows the Parallel task to create splits of multiple files. If a split has only one files, that file could be larger than the configured `maxSize`. Otherwise, the total size of files in the same split cannot be larger than `maxSize`. This means, if you have a very large file, there will be only one task that processes the big file. This could be addressed in the future by creating multiple splits for the same file, each of which references to disjoint parts of the file.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default `splitHintSpec` from none to `MaxSizeSplitHintSpec`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR fixes a rolling upgrade issue that occurs when druid-basic-security extension is used.\r\n\r\n`cachedSerializedGroupMappingMap` is a new endpoint on the coordinator added by #6972 . \r\n\r\nWhen a process running 0.17.0 or later is running alongside a coordinator running a version < 0.17.0, the new version process will attempt to fetch info from the ``cachedSerializedGroupMappingMap` endpoint which does not exist until the coordinator is upgraded. \r\n\r\nThis has the effect of blocking process startup until the retries for that endpoint are exhausted. The impact is worse for tasks launched during the rolling upgrade, as the overlord may kill tasks that take too long to start up.\r\n\r\nThe PR addresses this issue by having the polling mechanism stop retrying if it receives a 404 from the coordinator for the `cachedSerializedGroupMappingMap` endpoint and logging a warning message.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-12T22:54:20Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:17:16Z","closed_at":"2020-02-13T00:52:04Z","merged_at":"2020-02-13T00:52:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"48a0681f7eddcc32cbc57a8882b85a191d2336aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":606691557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDY2OTE1NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Compatibility","name":"Compatibility","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":null},{"id":692855937,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTI4NTU5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Security","name":"Security","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":null},{"id":698268891,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTgyNjg4OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Extension","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nWe are using a testing framework for parallel task that simulates the parallel indexing with an executor service. This framework requires to implement sub classes for each particular testing which is annoying. This PR is to fix this issue by injecting necessary tools automatically. You can still turn off the injection by adding `disableInject` in the task context.\r\n\r\nThis is also part of #9241 to easily add more unit tests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
