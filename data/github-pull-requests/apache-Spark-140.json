What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `FileUtil.unTarUsingJava` that is a Java implementation for un-tar `.tar` files. `unTarUsingJava` is not public but it exists in all Hadoop versions from 2.1+, see HADOOP-9264.\r\n\r\nThe security issue reproduction requires a non-Windows platform, and a non-gzipped TAR archive file name (contents don't matter).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere is a risk for arbitrary shell command injection via `Utils.unpack` when the filename is controlled by a malicious user. This is due to an issue in Hadoop's `unTar`, that is not properly escaping the filename before passing to a shell command:https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileUtil.java#L904\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it prevents a security issue that, previously, allowed users to execute arbitrary shall command.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in local, and existing test cases should cover.","created_at":"2022-03-23T04:00:02Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:47Z","closed_at":"2022-03-24T03:12:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8050f035d219e2c20862235c5361d51f526855dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the condition in `DeleteFromTable` required. Right now, the condition is optional and `None` is equivalent to a true literal. As a consequence, rules that handle such statements have to catch these two different yet equivalent representations, which makes those rules more complex. Instead, we can simply default the condition while parsing and make it required.\r\n\r\nThis change has been discussed and reviewed [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35395#discussion_r815234852).\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to simplify rules that handle `DeleteFromTable` plans.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSpark SQL uses the class Origin for tracking the position of each TreeNode in the SQL query text. When there is a parser error, we can show the position info in the error message:\r\n```\r\n> sql(\"create tabe foo(i int)\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nno viable alternative at input 'create tabe'(line 1, pos 7)\r\n\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\ncreate tabe foo(i int)\r\n-------^^^ \r\n```\r\nIt contains two fields: line and startPosition. This is enough for the parser since the SQL query text is known.\r\n\r\nHowever, the SQL query text is unknown in the execution phase. Spark SQL can't show the problematic SQL clause on ANSI runtime failures. \r\nThis PR is to include the query text in Origin. After this, we can provide details in the error messages of Expressions which can throw runtime exceptions when ANSI mode is on.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently,  there is not enough error context for runtime ANSI failures.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the error message only tells that there is a \"divide by zero\" error, without pointing out where the exact SQL statement is.\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales web_q1_q2, ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales store_q1_q2,\r\n  ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales web_q2_q3, ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales store_q2_q3\r\nFROM\r\n  ss ss1, ss ss2, ss ss3, ws ws1, ws ws2, ws ws3\r\nWHERE\r\n    ....  \r\n    AND CASE WHEN ws1.web_sales > 0\r\n    THEN ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales\r\n        ELSE NULL END\r\n    > CASE WHEN ss1.store_sales > 0\r\n    THEN ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales\r\n      ELSE NULL END\r\n    AND CASE WHEN ws2.web_sales > 0\r\n    THEN ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales\r\n        ELSE NULL END\r\n    > CASE WHEN ss2.store_sales > 0\r\n    THEN ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales\r\n      ELSE NULL END\r\nORDER BY ss1.ca_county\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: divide by zero at \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.divideByZeroError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:140) at \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DivModLike.eval(arithmetic.scala:437) at \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DivModLike.eval$(arithmetic.scala:425) at \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Divide.eval(arithmetic.scala:534)\r\n```\r\nThis PR is the initial PR for the project https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38615\r\nThe project is able to provide such error context:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: divide by zero\r\nSparkArithmeticException: divide by zero.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSpark SQL uses the class Origin for tracking the position of each TreeNode in the SQL query text. When there is a parser error, we can show the position info in the error message:\r\n```\r\n> sql(\"create tabe foo(i int)\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nno viable alternative at input 'create tabe'(line 1, pos 7)\r\n\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\ncreate tabe foo(i int)\r\n-------^^^ \r\n```\r\nIt contains two fields: line and startPosition. This is enough for the parser since the SQL query text is known.\r\n\r\nHowever, the SQL query text is unknown in the execution phase. Spark SQL can't show the problematic SQL clause on ANSI runtime failures. \r\nThis PR is to include the query text in Origin. After this, we can provide details in the error messages of Expressions which can throw runtime exceptions when ANSI mode is on.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently,  there is not enough error context for runtime ANSI failures.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the error message only tells that there is a \"divide by zero\" error, without pointing out where the exact SQL statement is.\r\n```\r\n> SELECT\r\n  ss1.ca_county,\r\n  ss1.d_year,\r\n  ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales web_q1_q2_increase,\r\n  ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales store_q1_q2_increase,\r\n  ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales web_q2_q3_increase,\r\n  ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales store_q2_q3_increase\r\nFROM\r\n  ss ss1, ss ss2, ss ss3, ws ws1, ws ws2, ws ws3\r\nWHERE\r\n  ss1.d_qoy = 1\r\n    AND ss1.d_year = 2000\r\n    AND ss1.ca_county = ss2.ca_county\r\n    AND ss2.d_qoy = 2\r\n    AND ss2.d_year = 2000\r\n    AND ss2.ca_county = ss3.ca_county\r\n    AND ss3.d_qoy = 3\r\n    AND ss3.d_year = 2000\r\n    AND ss1.ca_county = ws1.ca_county\r\n    AND ws1.d_qoy = 1\r\n    AND ws1.d_year = 2000\r\n    AND ws1.ca_county = ws2.ca_county\r\n    AND ws2.d_qoy = 2\r\n    AND ws2.d_year = 2000\r\n    AND ws1.ca_county = ws3.ca_county\r\n    AND ws3.d_qoy = 3\r\n    AND ws3.d_year = 2000\r\n    AND CASE WHEN ws1.web_sales > 0\r\n    THEN ws2.web_sales / ws1.web_sales\r\n        ELSE NULL END\r\n    > CASE WHEN ss1.store_sales > 0\r\n    THEN ss2.store_sales / ss1.store_sales\r\n      ELSE NULL END\r\n    AND CASE WHEN ws2.web_sales > 0\r\n    THEN ws3.web_sales / ws2.web_sales\r\n        ELSE NULL END\r\n    > CASE WHEN ss2.store_sales > 0\r\n    THEN ss3.store_sales / ss2.store_sales\r\n      ELSE NULL END\r\nORDER BY ss1.ca_county\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: divide by zero at \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.divideByZeroError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:140) at \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DivModLike.eval(arithmetic.scala:437) at \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DivModLike.eval$(arithmetic.scala:425) at \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Divide.eval(arithmetic.scala:534)\r\n```\r\nThis PR is the initial PR for the project https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38615\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Ensure output ordering using `requiredOrdering `\r\n- Override `outputOrdering` in `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` should ensure the output ordering is the `requiredOrdering`, so we leverage the  `EnsureRequirements` to add sort if need.\r\n\r\nFileFormatWriter will check and add an implicit sort for dynamic partition columns or bucket columns according to the input physical plan. The check became always failure since AQE AdaptiveSparkPlanExec has no outputOrdering.\r\n\r\nThat casues a redundant sort if user has specified a sort which satisfies the required ordering (dynamic partition and bucket columns).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, improve performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd test \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (c int) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY(p string);\r\nCREATE TABLE t2

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make `ceil(column)` in Scala/Python/Java APIs to keep the previous behaviour by returning `LongType` instead of `DecimalType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe shouldn't break compatibility and should keep the old behaviour of `ceil(column)` that returns `LongType`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo to end users. \r\n\r\nThis fixes a return type. In old version, `ceil(column)` returns `LongType`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/62421455e552b892d6e4f908d55a5886b37a37a9 mistakenly missed this case for Scala/Python APIs so it returns `DecimalType`.\r\n\r\nThis PR restores the previous behaviour back.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test was

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new config to set the memory overhead factor for drivers and executors. Currently the memory overhead is hard coded to 10% (except in Kubernetes), and the only way to set it higher is to set it to a specific memory amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn dynamic environments where different people or use cases need different memory requirements, it would be helpful to set a higher memory overhead factor instead of having to set a higher specific memory overhead value. The kubernetes resource manager already makes this configurable. This makes it configurable across the board.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo change to default behavior, just adds a new config users can change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT to check the memory calculation.","created_at":"2022-03-19T00:16:14Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T11:12:41Z","closed_at":"2022-03-22T11:12:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dcd9f524eefce6b9fea07968024ed97b2f0bfb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e7334fd22ff6d7105ab986ddac587d5b5eec694e","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:memory-overhead-factor-3.3","ref":"memory-overhead-factor-3.3","sha":"e7334fd22ff6d7105ab986ddac587d5b5eec694e","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use HashClusteredDistribution for stateful operators which requires exact order of clustering keys without allowing sub-clustering keys, so that stateful operators will have consistent partitioning across lifetime of the query. \r\n(It doesn't cover the case grouping keys are changed. We have state schema checker verifying on the changes, but changing name is allowed so swapping keys with same data type is still allowed. So there are still grey areas.)\r\n\r\nThe change will break the existing queries having checkpoint in prior to Spark 3.2.2 and bring silent correctness issues. To remedy the problem, we introduce a new internal config `spark.sql.streaming.statefulOperator.useStrictDistribution`, which defaults to true for new queries but defaults to false for queries starting from checkpoint in prior to Spark 3.2.2. If the new config is set to false, stateful operator will use ClusteredDistribution which retains the old requirement of child distribution. \r\n\r\nNote that in this change we don't fix the root problem against old checkpoints. Long-term fix should be crafted carefully, after collecting evidence on the impact of SPARK-38204. (e.g. how many queries on end users would encounter SPARK-38204.)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds E2E tests for the cases which trigger SPARK-38204, and verify the behavior with new query (3.2.2) & old query (in prior to 3.2.2).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPlease refer the description of JIRA issue [SPARK-38024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38204) for details, since the description is quite long to include here.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, stateful operators no longer accept the child output partitioning having subset of grouping keys and trigger additional shuffle. This will ensure consistent partitioning with stateful operators across lifetime of the query.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs including backward compatibility are added.","created_at":"2022-03-18T03:04:03Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T01:12:04Z","closed_at":"2022-03-23T01:12:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4342db8cba1ed2769c3b557a5ac47a78154d94ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a retry of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35871 with bumping up the version to 0.10.9.5.\r\nIt was reverted because of Python 3.10 is broken, and Python 3.10 was not officially supported in Py4J.\r\n\r\nIn Py4J 0.10.9.5, the issue was fixed (https://github.com/py4j/py4j/pull/475), and it added Python 3.10 support officially with CI set up (https://github.com/py4j/py4j/pull/477).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35871 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35871 \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPy4J sets up Python 3.10 CI now, and I manually tested PySpark with Python 3.10 with this patch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport py4j\r\npy4j.__version__\r\nspark.range(10).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing Python version 3.10.0 (default, Mar  3 2022 03:57:21)\r\nSpark context Web UI available at http://172.30.5.50:4040\r\nSpark context available as 'sc' (master = local[*], app id = local-1647571387534).\r\nSparkSession available as 'spark'.\r\n>>> import py4j\r\n>>> py4j.__version__\r\n'0.10.9.5'\r\n>>> spark.range(10).show()\r\n+---+\r\n|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds the capability of storing the required information into LevelDB for push based shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this PR, all the information is currently only stored in memory for push based shuffle in shuffle services. During NodeManager restarts, all these information will be lost. Either all the former merged shuffle data won't be able to serve the fetch requests, nor the shuffle services cannot merge any new push blocks from existing applications. After this patch, those information will be stored in LevelDB, and all the information will be recovered during NodeManager restarts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit testing.\r\nDeployed to clusters, and restart NMs in 3 different scenarios:\r\nWhile a Spark shell application is running, restart NMs in magnet partition in three different scenarios:\r\n1. After Spark-shell starts, but no scripts running, this will test the NM restart after application/executors register with NMs\r\n2. While there is on-going shuffle push to shuffle services\r\n3. While there is on-going merged shuffle fetch from shuffle services.\r\nResults of the large shuffle testing scripts is identical to the case when there is no NM

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds `StreamingOperatorProgress` to collect metrics from streaming operators other than `StateOperatorProgress` which is only for `StateStoreWriter`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAlthough we added `numRowsDroppedByWatermark` to `SessionWindowStateStoreRestoreExec`, but currently only `StateStoreWriter` will be collected metrics for `StateOperatorProgress`. So if we need `numRowsDroppedByWatermark` from `SessionWindowStateStoreRestoreExec` to be used in streaming listener, we need to incorporate `SessionWindowStateStoreRestoreExec` into `StateOperatorProgress`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Added one new field `operatorProgress` to `StreamingQueryProgress`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds a sorted version of `ds.groupByKey(…).flatMapGroups(…)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing method `flatMapGroups` provides an iterator of rows for each group key. If user code would requires those rows in a particular order, that iterator would have to be sorted first, which is against the idea of an iterator in the first place. For groups that do not fit into memory of one executor, this approach does not work.\r\n\r\n[org.apache.spark.sql.KeyValueGroupedDataset](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/47485a3c2df3201c838b939e82d5b26332e2d858/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/KeyValueGroupedDataset.scala#L134-L137):\r\n> Internally, the implementation will spill to disk if any given group is too large to fit into\r\n> memory.  However, users must take care to avoid materializing the whole iterator for a group\r\n> (for example, by calling `toList`) unless they are sure that this is possible given the memory\r\n> constraints of their cluster.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of `KeyValueGroupedDataset.flatMapGroups` already sorts each partition according to the group key. By additionally sorting by some data columns, the iterator can be guaranteed to provide some order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis adds `KeyValueGroupedDataset.flatMapSortedGroups`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere is test `DatasetSuite.\"groupBy function, flatMapSorted by func\"` and `DatasetSuite.\"groupBy function, flatMapSorted by

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new SQL function: `try_to_binary`. It is identical to the function `to_binary`, except that it returns NULL results instead of throwing an exception on encoding errors.\r\nThere is a similar function in Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/try_to_binary.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUsers can manage to finish queries without interruptions by encoding errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, adding a new SQL function: `try_to_binary`. It is identical to the function `to_binary`, except that it returns NULL results instead of throwing an exception on encoding errors.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new SQL function: try_avg. It is identical to the function `avg`, except that it returns NULL result instead of throwing an exception on decimal/interval value overflow.\r\nNote it is also different from `avg` when ANSI mode is off on interval overflows\r\n| Function         | avg                                | try_avg      |\r\n|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|\r\n| year-month interval overflow | Error                       | Return NULL |\r\n| day-time interval overflow | Error | Return NULL |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n* Users can manage to finish queries without interruptions in ANSI mode.\r\n* Users can get NULLs instead of runtime errors if interval overflow occurs when ANSI mode is off. For example\r\n```\r\n> SELECT avg(col) FROM VALUES (interval '2147483647 months'),(interval '1 months') AS tab(col)\r\njava.lang.ArithmeticException: integer overflow.\r\n\r\n> SELECT try_avg(col) FROM VALUES (interval '2147483647 months'),(interval '1 months') AS tab(col)\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, adding a new SQL function: try_avg. It is identical to the function `avg`, except that it returns NULL result instead of throwing an exception on decimal/interval value overflow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-28057 adds `forceCopy` arg to private `mapChildren` method in `TreeNode` to realize the `clone()` method.\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-34989, the call corresponding to `forceCopy=false` is changed to use `withNewChildren`, and `forceCopy`  always true and the private `mapChildren` only used by `clone()` method.\r\n\r\nSo this pr move the code of  private `mapChildren` method into `close()` method and remove the unreachable code branch when `forceCopy` is always true. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCode simplification.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRename the `external` top level directory to `connector`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`external` is a hardwired special name for bazel and this causes all sorts of issues with both native bazel or extensions like [bazel-compile-commands-extractor](https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor). Spark forks using bazel to build Spark have to go through hoops to make things work if at all.\r\n\r\nAmongst other things, making the source code browsable [through top level `external` symlink](\r\nhttps://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor#make-external-code-easily-browsable-also-necessary-for-this-tool-to-function-correctly) is impossible with a top level `external` directory in the repository.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan `./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package` and `./dev/run-tests`.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-16T10:18:16Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T13:18:53Z","closed_at":"2022-03-25T12:12:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdfb0b6dc6bc8b0962ab39e480b9461e3bd079ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35874/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35874/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35874/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/66b842323746a2545e069710f3a9e4125038e88c","head":{"label":"alkis:external-mv","ref":"external-mv","sha":"66b842323746a2545e069710f3a9e4125038e88c","user":{"login":"alkis","id":265981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTk4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/265981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis","html_url":"https://github.com/alkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":470195531,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAadSw","name":"spark","full_name":"alkis/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alkis","id":265981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTk4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/265981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis","html_url":"https://github.com/alkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alkis/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrade Py4J 0.10.9.4, with relevant documentation changes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPy4J 0.10.9.3 has a resource leak issue when pinned thread mode is enabled - it's enabled by default in PySpark at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/41af409b7bcfe1b3960274c0b3085bcc1f9d1c98.\r\nWe worked around this by enforcing users to use `InheritableThread` or `inhteritable_thread_target` as a workaround.\r\nAfter upgrading, we don't need to enforce users anymore because it automatically cleans up, see also https://github.com/py4j/py4j/pull/471\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users don't have to use `InheritableThread` or `inhteritable_thread_target` to avoid resource leaking problem anymore.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should test it

broadcast-hash to smj, i think it is necessary to display the number of empty partitions on spark ui.\r\nOtherwise, users might wonder why SMJ is used when joining a small table. Displaying the number of empty partitions is useful for users to understand changes to the execution plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanually

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR makes GeneratorNestedColumnAliasing only be able to apply to GetStructField*(_: AttributeReference), here GetStructField* means nested GetStructField. The current way to collect expressions is a top-down way and it actually only checks 2 levels which is wrong. The rule is simple - If we see expressions other than GetStructField, we are done. When an expression E is pushed down into an Explode, the thing happens is:\r\nE(x) is now pushed down to apply to E(array(x)).\r\nSo only expressions that can operate on both x and array(x) can be pushed. GetStructField is special since we have GetArrayStructFields and when GetStructField is pushed down, it becomes GetArrayStructFields. Any other expressions are not applicable.\r\nWe also do not even need to check the child type is Array(Array()) or whether the rewritten expression has the pattern GetArrayStructFields(GetArrayStructFields()).\r\n1. When the child input type is Array(Array()), the ExtractValues expressions we get will always start from an innermost GetArrayStructFields, it does not align with GetStructField*(x).\r\n2. When we see GetArrayStructFields(GetArrayStructFields()) in the rewritten generator, we must have seen a GetArrayStructFields in the expressions before pushdown.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt fixes some correctness issues. See the above section for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe \"prune unrequired references\" branch has the condition:\r\n\r\n`case p @ Project(_, g: Generate) if p.references != g.outputSet => `\r\n\r\nThis is wrong as generators like Inline will always enter this branch as long as it does not use all the generator output.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\ninput: <col1: array<struct<a: struct<a: int, b: int>, b: int>>>\r\n\r\nProject(a.a as x)\r\n\\- Generate(Inline(col1), ..., a, b)\r\n\r\np.references is [a]\r\ng.outputSet is [a, b]\r\n\r\nThis bug makes us never enter the GeneratorNestedColumnAliasing branch below thus miss some optimization opportunities. This PR changes the condition to check whether the child output is not used by the project and it is either not used by the generator or not already put into unrequiredChildOutput.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe wrong condition prevents some expressions like Inline, PosExplode from being optimized by rules after it.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `NTile`, the number of rows per bucket is computed as `n / buckets`, where `n` is the partition size, and `buckets` is the argument to `NTile` (number of buckets). The code currently casts the arguments to IntDecimal, then casts the result back to IntegerType.  This is unnecessary, since it is equivalent to just doing integer division, i.e. `n div buckets`.  This PR makes that simplifying change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSimplifies the code, and avoids a couple of casts at run-time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRelying on existing tests (specifically,

Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have supported partition overwrite with static mode by default while partition manged by catalog for a long time. It looks weird to me as `static mode` behaves catastrophically and deletes all data in table. Maybe setting partition overwrite with dynamic mode by default while partition manged by catalog, and user can set `partitionOverwriteMode` in table properties to support old behaviors. And also, this change can also bring a better experience to users when migrating from the original hive table to the datasource table, rather than the old data being deleted when the user does not know the meaning of `partitionOverwriteMode`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. We will no longer delete old partition data by default when user insert overwrite partitioned datasource tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nOrigin

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWrap AbstractContextManager returned by @contexmanager decorator function in function calls. The comment in the code change explain why it uses a wrapper class instead of wrapping functions of AbstractContextManager directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, method calls inside @contextmanager functions are treated as external for **with** statements.\r\n\r\nFor example, the below code records config.set_option calls inside ps.option_context(...)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith ps.option_context(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True):\r\n    pass \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should disable usage logging for calls inside @contextmanager functions to improve accuracy of the usage data\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- Existing tests\r\n- Manual test by running `./bin/pyspark` and verified the output:\r\n```\r\n>>>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn Spark, the UI lacks troubleshooting abilities. For example:\r\n* AQE plan changes are not available\r\n* plan description of a large plan is truncated\r\n\r\nThis is because the live UI depends on an in-memory KV store. We should always be worried\r\nabout the stability issues when adding more information to the store. Therefore, it's better to\r\nadd a disk-based store to save more information\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n* A disk-based KV Store in AppStatusStore that allows adding information that does not fits in memory\r\n* A separate listener that collects diagnostic data and saves it to the disk store\r\n* New Rest API endpoint to expose the diagnostics data (AQE plan changes, untruncated plan)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe troubleshooting ability is highly needed. Because without this, it's hard to\r\ndebug AQE related issues. Once we solve the blockers, we can make a long-term plan to improve the\r\nobservability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new REST API to expose more information of the application.\r\nRest API endpoint: http://localhost:4040/api/v1/applications/local-1647312132944/diagnostics/sql/0\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.appStatusStore.diskStore.dir=/tmp/diskstore\r\nspark-shell>\r\nval df = sql(\r\n  \"\"\"SELECT t1.*, t2.c, t3.d\r\n    |  FROM (SELECT 1 as a, 'b' as b) t1\r\n    |  JOIN (SELECT 1 as a, 'c' as c) t2\r\n    |  ON t1.a = t2.a\r\n    |  JOIN (SELECT 1 as a, 'd' as d) t3\r\n    |  ON t2.a = t3.a\r\n    |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\ndf.show()\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\" : 0,\r\n  \"physicalPlan\" : \"<plan description string>\",\r\n  \"submissionTime\" : \"2022-03-15T03:41:42.226GMT\",\r\n  \"completionTime\" : \"2022-03-15T03:41:43.387GMT\",\r\n  \"errorMessage\" : \"\",\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExtend CREATE TABLE and REPLACE TABLE statements to support columns with DEFAULT values. This information will be stored in the column metadata.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis builds the foundation for future work (not included in this PR) to support INSERT INTO statements, which may then omit the default values or refer to them explicitly with the DEFAULT keyword, in which case the Spark analyzer will automatically insert the appropriate corresponding values in the right places.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE T(a INT DEFAULT 4, b INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 5);\r\nINSERT INTO T VALUES (1);\r\nINSERT INTO T VALUES (1, DEFAULT);\r\nINSERT INTO T VALUES

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAccording to SQL-1999 (the latest version of the ANSI SQL specification that I have access to), SQL strings are quoted with single quotes (`'`), and \"delimited identifiers\" are quoted with double-quotes (`\"`).\r\n\r\nSpark currently supports both single and double quotes for strings, which is not ANSI-compliant, and does not support double-quotes for identifiers, only backticks.\r\n\r\nThis PR brings Spark closer to the ANSI specified behavior with single quotes for strings and double quotes for identifiers.\r\n\r\nThe first commit (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35853/commits/bec0b4abd62b41c60266125306086966e0610b45) updates the SQL grammar to make this syntax change.\r\n\r\nThe second commit (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35853/commits/ccc4406f317e447bf31ddf1a3ec8f8982e30c2a5) updates documentation.\r\n\r\nThe remaining commits update existing tests to consistently use single quotes instead of double quotes for SQL strings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe main motivation is to support the official TPC-DS queries, which use double-quoted aliases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users will no longer be able to use double quotes for strings and will need to use single quotes instead.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRetry `ClassSymbol.selfType` in case we receive a cyclic reference exception.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`ClassSymbol.selfType` fails on certain classes like `HiveGenericUDF` due to cyclic reference. This issue is due to [bug#12190 in Scala](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12190) which does not handle cyclic references in Java annotations correctly. The cyclic reference in this case comes from `InterfaceAudience` annotation which [annotates itself](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/db8ae4b65448c506c9234641b2c1f9b8e894dc18/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-annotations/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/classification/InterfaceAudience.java#L45). This annotation class is present in the type hierarchy of `HiveGenericUDF`.\r\n\r\nTo workaround the issue, we can just retry the operation and it will succeed on the retry probably because the annotation is partially resolved from the previous attempt.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test. This unit test prefers to be run a separate JVM as the error for cyclic references may not be thrown if the annotation class is previously loaded by some other test and so may be dependent on test execution order.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

of #35837.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen building the project list from an aggregate sequence in `ExtractGenerator`, convert the aggregate sequence to an `IndexedSeq` before performing the flatMap operation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis query fails with a `NullPointerException`:\r\n```\r\nval df = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDF(\"v\")\r\ndf.select(Stream(explode(array(min($\"v\"), max($\"v\"))), sum($\"v\")): _*).collect\r\n```\r\nIf you change `Stream` to `Seq`, then it succeeds.\r\n\r\n`ExtractGenerator` uses a flatMap operation over `aggList` for two purposes:\r\n\r\n- To produce a new aggregate list\r\n- to update `projectExprs` (which is initialized as an array of nulls).\r\n\r\nWhen `aggList` is a `Stream`, the flatMap operation evaluates lazily, so all entries in `projectExprs` after the first will still be null when the rule completes.\r\n\r\nChanging `aggList` to an `IndexedSeq` forces the flatMap to evaluate eagerly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Explicitly return in GeneratorNestedColumnAliasing when the generator is not Explode.\r\n2. Add extensive comment to GeneratorNestedColumnAliasing.\r\n3. An off-hand code refactor to make the code clearer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nGeneratorNestedColumnAliasing does not handle other generators correctly. We only try to rewrite the generator for Explode but try to rewrite all ExtractValue expressions. This can cause inconsistency for non-Explode generators.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new SQL function: try_sum. It is identical to the function `sum`, except that it returns `NULL` result instead of throwing an exception on integral/decimal value overflow.\r\nNote it is different from sum when ANSI mode is off:\r\n| Function         | Sum                                | TrySum      |\r\n|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|\r\n| Decimal overflow | Return NULL                        | Return NULL |\r\n| Integer overflow | Return lower 64 bits of the result | Return NULL |\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n* Users can manage to finish queries without interruptions in ANSI mode.\r\n* Users can get NULLs instead of unreasonable results if overflow occurs when ANSI mode is off. For example\r\n```\r\n> SELECT sum(col) FROM VALUES (9223372036854775807L), (1L) AS tab(col);\r\n-9223372036854775808\r\n\r\n> SELECT try_sum(col) FROM VALUES (9223372036854775807L), (1L) AS tab(col);\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new SQL function: try_sum which is identical to the function `sum`, except that it returns `NULL` result instead of throwing an exception on integral/decimal value overflow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:
