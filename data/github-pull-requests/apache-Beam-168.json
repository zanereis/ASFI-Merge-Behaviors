a first step towards making it possible to assign different environments to sections of a pipeline, we first need to expose environment classes to the pipeline API. Unlike PTransforms, PCollections, Coders, and Windowings, environments exists solely in the portability framework as protobuf objects. By creating a hierarchy of \"native\" classes that represent the various environment types – external, docker, process, etc – users will be able to instantiate these and assign them to parts of the pipeline.

is a race condition in GrpcStateRequestHandler which surfaced after the\r\nrecent changes to process append/clear state request asynchronously. The race\r\ncondition can occur if multiple Runner workers process a transform with state\r\nrequests with the same SDK Harness. The SDK Harness has multiple workers threads\r\nwhich can access the id generation code in parallel.\r\n\r\nFor example, this setup occurs with Flink when a TaskManager has multiple task\r\nslots and two or more of those slots process the same stateful stage against an\r\nSDK Harness.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

was a little confusing to see the outputs of the code as lists rather than what actually outputs when running the code.\r\n\r\nChanging the outputs of the code snippets to what we actually see when running the code, this makes it consistent with the outputs of the notebooks as well.\r\n\r\nIt's mostly adding some logic to \"parse\" the stdout outputs, but the logic of the code samples stays the same.\r\n\r\nI did some style changes to the `Partition` samples to make them easier to read as well.\r\n\r\nR: @aaltay \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

option was added when it wasn't possible to specify the worker count as pipeline option, which is no longer the case. The pipeline option has a special value of 0, which means that the runner should pick a suitable value. Unfortunately this was overridden in FlinkJobInvoker with 1 (because that's the default in the  JobServerDriver config). There is no need to have this option in the job server.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

for writing to clustered tables in BigQuery was added in 2.15,\r\nwhich involved adding a new optional clustering field to TableDestination.\r\nClustering support is working for most cases, but fails with errors about\r\nincompatible partitioning specifications for any data that is handled by the\r\nMultiplePartitions branch of BigQueryIO logic.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by passing through the clustering specification in\r\nMatchTableDynamicDestinations.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

appears there is an omission in the RabbitMQ Reader where there is no way for a caller to specify that the reader should use the `correlation id`. It is hard-coded to `false` by default, and there is no corresponding `withUseCorrelationId` setter exposed (and the Builder is package-private with no means of obtaining one).\r\n\r\nIn this PR I simply add a `withUseCorrelationId` function on the `Read` implementation.\r\n\r\nR: @jbonofre \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR adds an optional rate limit policy to KinesisIO.Read that can be configured with the following methods:\r\n\r\n`withFixedDelayRateLimitPolicy()`\r\nSpecifies a fixed delay rate limit policy with the default delay of 1 second.\r\n\r\n`withFixedDelayRateLimitPolicy(Duration delay)`\r\nSpecifies a fixed delay rate limit policy with the given delay.\r\n\r\n`withDynamicDelayRateLimitPolicy(Supplier<Duration> delay)`\r\nSpecifies a dynamic delay rate limit policy with the given function being called at each polling interval to get the next delay value.\r\n\r\n`withCustomRateLimitPolicy(RateLimitPolicyFactory rateLimitPolicyFactory)`\r\nSpecifies the RateLimitPolicyFactory for a custom rate limiter.\r\n\r\nThis provides a strategy interface for dealing with the Kinesis hard limit of 5 read requests per second per shard. The FixedDelayRateLimiter will apply a fixed delay between read calls. The default is a \"no limiter\" policy which preserves the behavior of the current implementation.\r\n R: @aromanenko-dev\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added an option to `InMemoryTable`, which enables choosing what to push-down: none (default), projects, filters, both. With the purpose to simplify unit testing.\r\n2. Create a rule to push fields used by a `Calc` (projects and a condition) down into `InMemoryTable` IO.\r\n3. Updating that same `Calc`  (from previous step) to have a proper input and output schemes, remove unused fields.\r\n3.1. Remove `Calc` completely when it only renames field names and update `RowType` of the `IOSourceRel`.\r\n4. Update cost model to favor IO with projects pushed-down.\r\n4.1. Right now it is accomplished by multiplying row count by the number of projected fields.\r\n\r\nStill needs to be done:\r\n1. Refactoring (currently in progress).\r\n\r\nBased on top of #9743 \r\n\r\nDesign doc [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ysD7U7qF3MAmSfkbXZO_5PLJBevAL9bktlLCerd_jE/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds new coders for returning the entire PublishResult object from SnsIO, or the entire PublishResult without HTTP headers. This is necessary in order to check the HTTP status for errors since the current implementation only encodes the messageId field. These new coders can be selected by calling the new `withFullPublishResult()` and `withFullPublishResultWithoutHeaders()` methods on SnsIO.Write. The `withCoder()` method also allows setting a custom coder. This PR also adds coders for common AWS SDK objects `ResponseMetadata` and `SdkHttpMetadata`.\r\nR: @lukecwik \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

@angoenka @tweise \r\n\r\nThis is basically just a restructuring of the Flink portable jars to enable them to include and toggle between different pipelines. Specifically, this PR changes only the _structure_ and _execution_ of portable jars. This PR does not change the existing behavior and *does not implement a way to actually create portable jars with multiple pipelines*, although it would be fairly straightforward to roll such a jar oneself from existing single-pipeline jars.\r\n\r\nEach pipeline lives in the jar under a subdirectory of `BEAM-PIPELINE`, and different subdirectories can be chosen using the new `--base-job-name` flag at runtime.\r\n\r\nI included this in the Javadoc, but here it is formatted:\r\n<p>Jar layout:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>META-INF/\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>MANIFEST.MF\r\n      </ul>\r\n  <li>BEAM-PIPELINE/\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>[1st pipeline (default)]\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>pipeline.json\r\n              <li>pipeline-options.json\r\n              <li>artifact-manifest.json\r\n              <li>artifacts/\r\n                  <ul>\r\n                    <li>...artifact files...\r\n                  </ul>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        <li>[nth pipeline]\r\n            <ul>\r\n              Same as above\r\n        </ul>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <li>...Java classes...\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The first residual is the first unprocessed element. This happened rarely, and was thus hard to detect.\r\n\r\nI figured out a way to block processing so we could send \"in process\" split requests and validate that we never split on the current element. This also lets us validate the Progress count (that is, the number of completely processed elements) is accurate, since we know which index on which we've blocked, and how many came before.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change solves the problem when using FixedWindows combined with WriteToText in the Python SDK. It can be easily reproduced with top_wikipedia_sessions example.\r\n\r\nI am marking this as a WIP, since provided it is a reasonable solution, I need some guidance on what is the right approach to write a regression test for this. I will appreciate any help on this, as this is my first potential contribution to Beam, and I am Beam's user since a very short time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Added pcoll_visualization module to visualize materialized\r\nPCollection data.\r\n2. A visualization mainly consists of 3 parts: facets-dive,\r\nfacets-overview and data-table.\r\n3. The visualization is always non-blocking w/ 2 modes: one-shot and\r\ndynamic plotting.\r\n4. One-shot visualization renders the visualization as HTML statically.\r\n5. Dynamical plotting polls materialized data, initializes a\r\nvisualization and then updates the visualization continuously.\r\n6. It's the pipeline state, i.e., whether the PCollection\r\nmaterialization is being updated that decides if the visualization is\r\ndynamic plotting or one-shot. It's not the boundedness of PCollection\r\nthat decides the visualization mode. However, when engineering for\r\nInteractive Beam, it's alright to always use the dynamic plotting\r\nmode as long as the InteractiveRunner(s) manages jobs and tracks the\r\npipeline(job) results correctly. Failing to terminate a visualization\r\njob might cause resource leak.\r\n7. The materialized PCollection data goes through the following process\r\nflow: cache -> element list -> normalization -> dataframe ->\r\nHTMLs/scripts.\r\n8. A visualization is always self-contained. Meaning it controls when\r\nthe visualization starts and ends by itself. Once visualized, the\r\nvisualization is anchored within the notebook cell's output area. Code\r\nin other cells can affect the visualization in the cell but will not\r\nchange the existing visualization's position in the notebook. Multiple\r\nvisualize(pcoll) calls will render multiple independent distinct\r\nvisualization instances/jobs. Each visualization runs in its own thread\r\noutside of the notebook main thread.\r\n9. Unittest added focusing on the above visualization logic other than\r\nthe visualization UI (those should belong to Facets, pandas and jQuery,\r\nwe'll trust them work as intended). Integration tests can be added\r\nlater.\r\n10. Each visualization job regularly queries interactive environment for\r\nrunning pipeline(job) results implicitly to determine the default\r\nvisualization end condition. It's based on the limitation that within\r\ncurrent interactive environment, at a time, at most one job is in\r\nnon-terminated state for an end user defined pipeline instance (in\r\nwhatever state). The end user could also use the handle returned by\r\nvisualize() to stop() the visualization job manually.\r\n11. Added INTERACTIVE_BEAM extras_require and tests_require in setup.\r\nThey are only needed for data visualization in notebook. `jsons` is for\r\neasy serialization of any object and `timeloop` is for self-contained\r\nperiodic async tasks. They both use MIT licenses. `facets-overview` is\r\nfor overview part of facets. It uses apache 2.0 license. `ipython` is the\r\nkernel used by jupyter, included for non-jupyter environment though it\r\nalways comes with jupyter. It uses BSD license. The lower version limit\r\nset is the highest version listed by flink.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

2.4 provides a number of new features and fixes, but the most important/pressing one for me is that 2.4 adds support for understanding python type annotations, which fixes a bunch of spurious unused import errors in the [typing PR](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9056) I'm working on for BEAM-7746.\r\n\r\nAs of 2.0, pylint dropped support for running tests using python2, so to make the upgrade we have to move our lint jobs to python3.  The version of python *tested for* is bound to the version of the interpreter used,  and there is not an option to run in python2-compatible mode. That said, the beam code is intended to be python3 compatible, so in practice, performing a python3 lint on the Beam code-base is perfectly safe. The primary risk of doing so is that someone could introduce a python-3 only change that breaks python2 and pylint would not catch it, but these would predominantly be syntax errors that would be immediately caught by the unit and integration tests.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
