Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug I encountered with the SQL auto limit wrapping behavior used by the web console, when pointed at data generated from the ['basic' schema from druid-benchmarks](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/benchmark/datagen/BenchmarkSchemas.java#L45). Out of the box, the query produced by the web console would not plan, but if I either removed _any_ column from the output, or explicitly specified a limit, the query would function correctly. The only difference between setting an explicit limit and using the auto limit was that the `LogicalSort` of the auto limit had an offset of 0 instead of null, and modifying the planner to only set offset on the sort if the offset was non-zero has resolve the issue. This matches the behavior of the sort collapse rule, which only sets offset if it is greater than 0.\r\n\r\nHowever, why removing columns would allow the query to plan prior to the changes in this PR remains a mystery to me and I find it bothersome, but I haven't had a chance to dig into the planner more to find out what is going on.\r\n\r\nThe added test illustrates this behavior, where the 2nd query does not plan without the changes in this PR. I tried to replicate the issue by just having a lot of columns not in the exact schema as the benchmark generator data, but I was unable to do it by hand with all string dimensions at least, so I ended up copying in 2 rows from the benchmark generator in order to get this unit test in place.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test

cluster.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-15T09:22:47Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T17:30:21Z","closed_at":"2019-12-16T09:38:25Z","merged_at":"2019-12-16T09:38:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc16ff5e7cbbe980d17dd106ac0324e057890739","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/9004.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/9005.\r\n\r\nEach extension module needs to properly bind whatever it will use, but sometimes different modules need to bind the same class which will lead to the duplicate injection error. To avoid this problem, each module is supposed to bind different instances. This PR adds new annotations to bind different instances.\r\n\r\nAlso `ParquetReader` is changed to use the injected Configuration.\r\n\r\nThis PR is tested with\r\n\r\n- Native orc ingestion\r\n- Native paquet ingestion\r\n- Hadoop text file ingestion\r\n- Hadoop orc ingestion\r\n- Hadoop parquet ingestion\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in

Description\r\n\r\nAdds new configuration `druid.server.http.enableForwardedRequestCustomizer` to optionally add [ForwardedRequestCustomizer](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/9.4.22.v20191022/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ForwardedRequestCustomizer.html) to Jetty Connector. It is to be used when Druid is behind a proxy for whatever reason, for example proxy is doing TLS termination. In that case Druid receives a HTTP request and `request.getScheme()` returns `http` so any redirects are not done to `https` . Proxy sends `X-Forwarded-*` headers to provide true source information including the scheme  and is handled correctly in the Druid jetty server when above configuration is enabled.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the web-console data loader to support the unified `InputSource` schema for S3 and Google Cloud Storage, which both support any of `uris`, `prefixes`, or `objects`. This actually fixes a bug as well since the `blobs` property on the older Google `Firehose` no longer exists on the `InputSource`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1269\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-05 at 1 30 48

#8984 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDruid security extension to support authentication based on OpenID Connect spec. Please see added file `druid-pac4j.md` for further information.\r\n\r\nThis patch...\r\n1. adds a new security extension, druid-pac4j,  with `Authenticator` implementation using [pac4j](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j) library\r\n2. removes `/unified-console.html` from default unsecured paths , and introduces `UnautorizedResourceFilter` similar to existing `UnsecuredResourceFilter` to avoid \"authentication done\" check made by `PreResponseAuthorizationCheckFilter` . This is done so that redirect to authentication server (e.g. Okta) is correctly handled by browser when user visits the web console.\r\n\r\nI have tested the it using [Okta dev server](https://developer.okta.com/) . Also, a version of this code is running on our internal Druid clusters in prod with enterprise Okta auth server.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in

Description\r\n\r\nWith this PR we intend to upstream the module we use to autoscale druid in GCE.\r\n\r\nThe module structure—and configuration— take inspiration from the autoscaling module for EC2 and they are quite straightforward.\r\n\r\nThe central piece is represented by the `GCEAutoScaler` class implementing the interface `org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.autoscaling.AutoScaler` and embedding all the logic to communicate with GCE to provision and terminate instances.\r\n\r\nThe module manages the instances through the Managed Instances Groups of GCE in order to make the interaction, and in turn the logic of the module, simpler.\r\n\r\nAside from the code, we provide the documentation in `docs/development/extensions-contrib/gce-extensions.md` explaining how to set up the instances, the group and the account for the module to be used. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This input source always has a fixed input format (`DruidInputFormat`).

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to #8578, adding a handful of query metrics that I believe are interesting, but taking the conservative approach in that all of them are off by default, meaning a custom extension implementing `QueryMetrics` is necessary to actually emit them. `ParallelMergeCombiningSequence` is in `druid-core` where as `QueryMetrics` and friends are in `druid-processing`, so this is done mechanically via a `Consumer<ParallelMergeCombiningSequence.MergeCombineMetrics>` that is supplied to to the sequence, where `ParallelMergeCombiningSequence.MergeCombineMetrics` is the type that all of the metrics from the fork join tasks are accumulated. This allows the consumer, `CachingClusteredClient` in our case, to define how to report the metrics.\r\n\r\nNew `QueryMetrics` metrics methods:\r\n* `reportParallelMergeParallelism` - Reports number of parallel tasks the broker used to process the query during parallel merge\r\n* `reportParallelMergeInputSequences` -  Reports total number of input sequences processed by the broker during parallel merge\r\n* `reportParallelMergeInputRows` - Reports total number of input rows processed by the broker during parallel merge\r\n* `reportParallelMergeOutputRows` - Reports broker total number of output rows after merging and combining input sequences\r\n* `reportParallelMergeTaskCount` - Reports broker total number of fork join pool tasks required to complete query\r\n* `reportParallelMergeTotalCpuTime` - Reports broker total CPU time in nanoseconds where fork join merge combine tasks were doing work\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since parallelism will always be a fixed range of values between 1 and the number of cores, it can also be added as a dimension instead through `QueryMetrics.parallelMergeParallelism`.\r\n\r\nI did not document these metrics because they are off by default, and don't want to give operators false hope before they get in deep and realize they need to make a custom extension or whatever. This omission is in favor of someday refining this process so that maybe we bundle several different 'profiles' to enabling emitting a set of metrics based on the profile, or some other system that allows operators to customize without a custom extension.\r\n\r\nAlso absent are any sort of aggregate metrics, such as pool utilization over some periodic collection interval or whatever. I would like to look into this as a follow-up, since it seems like there are potentially many metrics that would maybe make sense to collect like this, so I'd like to think a bit harder about how to do this so it's not a one-off solution.\r\n\r\nThis PR also modifies the parallel merge config to disable using the fork join pool if the computed level of pool parallelism isn't more than 2, since you need at least 3 tasks to do the 2 layer merge in parallel.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nAdds `prefixes` to the google storage input source added in #8907, making this extension symmetrical with the s3 extension in #8903, after which this implementation is modeled, except using the google storage object list API https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/list instead of the s3 list objects API (I guess obviously).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this refactors

Description\r\n\r\nImplements single dimension range partitioning for native parallel batch indexing as described in #8769. This initial version requires the druid-datasketches extension to be added to the classpath.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm has 5 phases that are orchestrated by the supervisor in `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask#runRangePartitionMultiPhaseParallel()`. These phases and the main classes involved are described below:\r\n\r\n1) In parallel, determine the distribution of dimension values for each input source split.\r\n\r\n   `PartialDimensionDistributionTask` uses `StringSketch` to generate the approximate distribution of dimension values for each input source split. If the rows are ungrouped, `PartialDimensionDistributionTask.UngroupedRowDimensionValueFilter` uses a Bloom filter to skip rows that would be grouped. The final distribution is sent back to the supervisor via `DimensionDistributionReport`.\r\n\r\n2) The range partitions are determined.\r\n\r\n   In `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask#determineAllRangePartitions()`, the supervisor uses `StringSketchMerger` to merge the individual `StringSketch`es created in the preceding phase. The merged sketch is then used to create the range partitions.\r\n\r\n3) In parallel, generate partial range-partitioned segments.\r\n\r\n   `PartialRangeSegmentGenerateTask` uses the range partitions determined in the preceding phase and `RangePartitionCachingLocalSegmentAllocator` to generate `SingleDimensionShardSpec`s. The partition information is sent back to the supervisor via `GeneratedGenericPartitionsReport`.\r\n\r\n4) The partial range segments are grouped.\r\n\r\n   In `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask#groupGenericPartitionLocationsPerPartition()`, the supervisor creates the `PartialGenericSegmentMergeIOConfig`s necessary for the next phase.\r\n\r\n5) In parallel, merge partial range-partitioned segments.\r\n\r\n   `PartialGenericSegmentMergeTask` uses `GenericPartitionLocation` to retrieve the partial range-partitioned segments generated earlier and then merges and publishes them.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n`SplittableInputSource` has two methods for parallel indexing. `getNumSplits()` returns the exact number of splits to process and `createSplits()` returns a stream of `InputSplit`s. Even though they are pretty tightly related to each other, it's not recommended to cache all splits in memory because it could be big if there are too many input splits. However, if it doesn't cache, the number of splits from `getNumSplits()` and `createSplits()` can be different because some files can be created or deleted between calls.\r\n\r\n`getNumSplits()` is currently used for 2 purposes in the parallel indexing task. First is to check that all subtasks of a phase has succeeded and second is to estimate the progress of each phase. This PR is to fix the bug above by changing `getNumSplits()` to `getEstimatedNumSplits()`. `ParallelIndexingPhaseRunner` will use the number of `SubTaskSpec`s that it has iterated and compare it against the number of succeeded subtasks to determine the end of the phase. For the phase progress, it will just use the estimated number of total splits which could be wrong but doesn't that harm.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR modifies the 'smart limit' strategy in the web-console query view to use the `sqlOuterLimit` parameter introduced in #8566. It also fixes a bug with `sqlOuterLimit` if the outer rel is already a `LogicalSort` which would cause a query which should plan to a topN but without a limit set to be unplannable. The logic now will modify the limit of an outer sort instead of wrapping it in another sort.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

Description\r\nThis PR is an alternate to #8876, which was just awful, but I was afraid of introducing an if statement to `NullHandling. replaceWithDefault` in something that is called often on the query path. However, curiosity got the best of me, so I added a new benchmark schema to help determine how much of a performance hit introducing an if statement. It turns it that it isn't really noticeable, so I'm closing #8876 in favor of this PR instead.\r\n\r\nbefore PR:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                              (defaultStrategy)

Description\r\nAnother follow up to #8823, this PR adds a Google CloudStorage `InputSource` and `InputEntity` implementation allowing it to be used with the new native batch indexing interfaces.

https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/8836.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI think I don't like this patch much, but don't see a better solution. Please leave comments if anyone has a better idea.\r\n\r\n`TaskMonitor.submit()` creates a sub task for a given spec submits it to the overlord. Here, if the task type was unknown to the overlord (can happen during a rolling update), the overlord would return an HTTP error to `TaskMonitor`. `HttpIndexingServiceClient` would throw an `IllegalStateException` if the HTTP response was not 200.\r\n\r\nTo handle this, I added a new method `SubTaskSpec.newSubTaskWithBackwardCompatibleType()` which will be called if `SubTaskSpec.newSubTask()` fails with an `IllegalStateExceptoin` with a message starting with \"Could not resolve type id\". \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
