for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor the following:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t USING json AS SELECT 1 AS i\r\nSELECT * FROM spark_catalog.t\r\n```\r\n`spark_catalog.t` is resolved to `spark_catalog.default.t` assuming the current namespace is `default`. However, this is not consistent with V2 behavior where the namespace must be specified if the catalog name is provided. This PR proposes to fix this inconsistency.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo be consistent with V2 table naming scheme in SQL commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the user has to specify the namespace if the catalog name is provided. For example,\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM spark_catalog.t # Will throw AnalysisException with 'Session catalog cannot have an empty namespace: spark_catalog.t'\r\nSELECT * FROM spark_catalog.default.t # OK\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for #27395\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `allGather` method is added to the `BarrierTaskContext`. This method contains the same functionality as the `BarrierTaskContext.barrier` method; it blocks the task until all tasks make the call, at which time they may continue execution. In addition, the `allGather` method takes an input message. Upon returning from the `allGather` the task receives a list of all the messages sent by all the tasks that made the `allGather` call.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are many situations where having the tasks communicate in a synchronized way is useful. One simple example is if each task needs to start a server to serve requests from one another; first the tasks must find a free port (the result of which is undetermined beforehand) and then start making requests, but to do so they each must know the port chosen by the other task. An `allGather` method would allow them to inform each other of the port they will run on.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, an `BarrierTaskContext.allGather` method will be available through the Scala, Java, and Python APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMost of the code path is already covered by tests to the `barrier` method, since this PR includes a refactor so that much code is shared by the `barrier` and `allGather` methods. However, a test is added to assert that an all gather on each tasks partition ID will return a list of every partition ID.\r\n\r\nAn example through the Python API:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark import BarrierTaskContext\r\n>>>\r\n>>> def f(iterator):\r\n...     context = BarrierTaskContext.get()\r\n...     return [context.allGather('{}'.format(context.partitionId()))]\r\n...\r\n>>> sc.parallelize(range(4), 4).barrier().mapPartitions(f).collect()[0]\r\n[u'3', u'1', u'0', u'2']\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-20T01:06:57Z","updated_at":"2020-03-16T16:25:41Z","closed_at":"2020-02-21T19:40:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9fc7757c6ce80c68427cba0cb411d403523ca4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c259acd3e447450a18bcdeea47d14ac8514b1bc","head":{"label":"sarthfrey:master","ref":"master","sha":"7c259acd3e447450a18bcdeea47d14ac8514b1bc","user":{"login":"sarthfrey","id":9577559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1Nzc1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9577559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey","html_url":"https://github.com/sarthfrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237150706,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzcxNTA3MDY=","name":"spark","full_name":"sarthfrey/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarthfrey","id":9577559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1Nzc1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9577559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey","html_url":"https://github.com/sarthfrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarthfrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarthfrey/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen loading DataFrames from JDBC datasource with Kerberos authentication, remote executors (yarn-client/cluster etc. modes) fail to establish a connection due to lack of Kerberos ticket or ability to generate it.\r\n\r\nThis is a real issue when trying to ingest data from kerberized data sources (SQL Server, Oracle) in enterprise environment where exposing simple authentication access is not an option due to IT policy issues.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've added Postgres support (other supported databases will come in later PRs).\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* Added `keytab` and `principal` JDBC options\r\n* Added `ConnectionProvider` trait and it's impementations:\r\n  * `BasicConnectionProvider` => unsecure connection\r\n  * `PostgresConnectionProvider` => postgres secure connection\r\n* Added `ConnectionProvider` tests\r\n* Added `PostgresKrbIntegrationSuite` docker integration test\r\n* Created `SecurityUtils` to concentrate re-usable security related functionalities\r\n* Documentation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing JDBC kerberos support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, 2 additional JDBC options added:\r\n* keytab\r\n* principal\r\n\r\nIf both provided then Spark does kerberos authentication.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTo demonstrate the functionality with a standalone application I've created this repository: https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/docker-kerberos\r\n\r\n* Additional + existing unit tests\r\n* Additional docker integration test\r\n* Test on cluster manually\r\n* `SKIP_API=1 jekyll build`\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-19T12:57:28Z","updated_at":"2020-04-26T22:55:24Z","closed_at":"2020-03-13T02:04:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdc89a631cbe2a5490ef7eec0d6c1573470e1f67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27637/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27637/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27637/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/301cc1a7426ac5917b2535374151921064eaa392","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-30874","ref":"SPARK-30874","sha":"301cc1a7426ac5917b2535374151921064eaa392","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn many public cloud environments, the node loss (in case of AWS SpotLoss,Spot blocks and GCP preemptible VMs) is a planned and informed activity. \r\nThe cloud provider intimates the cluster manager about the possible loss of node ahead of time. Few examples is listed here:\r\na) Spot loss in AWS(2 min before event)\r\nb) GCP Pre-emptible VM loss (30 second before event)\r\nc) AWS Spot block loss with info on termination time (generally few tens of minutes before decommission as configured in Yarn)\r\n\r\nDesign Doc of this PR https://docs.google.com/document/d/1urypkQVZY6oMNZXLuEPifNPxo_gqJng2osKTDRfWi08/edit#heading=h.y1m32a7uhh1z\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to make spark leverage the knowledge of the node loss in future, and tries to adjust the scheduling of tasks to minimise the impact on the application. \r\nIt is well known that when a host is lost, the executors, its running tasks, their caches and also Shuffle data is lost. This could result in wastage of compute and other resources.\r\n\r\nThe focus here is to build a framework for YARN, that can be extended for other cluster managers to handle such scenario.\r\n\r\nThe framework must handle one or more of the following:-\r\n1) Prevent new tasks from starting on any executors on decommissioning Nodes. \r\n2) Decide to kill the running tasks so that they can be restarted elsewhere (assuming they will not complete within the deadline) OR we can allow them to continue hoping they will  finish within deadline.\r\n3) Clear the shuffle data entry from MapOutputTracker of decommission node hostname to prevent the shuffle fetchfailed exception.The most significant advantage of unregistering shuffle outputs when Spark schedules the first re-attempt to compute the missing blocks, it notices all of the missing blocks from decommissioned nodes and recovers in only one attempt. This speeds up the recovery process significantly over the scheduled Spark implementation, where stages might be rescheduled multiple times to recompute missing shuffles from all nodes, and prevent jobs from being stuck for hours failing and recomputing.\r\n4) Prevent the stage to abort due to the fetchfailed exception in case of decommissioning of node. In Spark there is number of consecutive stage attempts allowed before a stage is aborted.This is controlled by the config spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts. Not accounting fetch fails due decommissioning of nodes towards stage failure improves the reliability of the system.\r\n\r\nMain components of change\r\n1) Get the ClusterInfo update from the Resource Manager -> Application Master -> Spark Driver.\r\n2) DecommissionTracker, resides inside driver, tracks all the decommissioned nodes and take necessary action and state transition.\r\n3) Based on the decommission node list add hooks at code to achieve\r\n  a) No new task on executor\r\n  b) Remove shuffle data mapping info for the node to be decommissioned from the mapOutputTracker\r\n  c) Do not count fetchFailure from decommissioned towards stage failure\r\n\r\nOn the receiving info that node is to be decommissioned, the below action needs to be performed by DecommissionTracker on driver:\r\n * Add the entry of Nodes in DecommissionTracker with termination time and node state as \"DECOMMISSIONING\".\r\n * Stop assigning any new tasks on executors on the nodes which are candidate for decommission. This makes sure slowly as the tasks finish the usage of this node would  die down.\r\n *  Kill all the executors for the decommissioning nodes after configurable period of time, say \"spark.graceful.decommission.executor.leasetimePct\". This killing ensures two things. Firstly, the task failure will be attributed in job failure count. Second, avoid generation on more shuffle data on the node that will eventually be lost.  The node state is set to \"EXECUTOR_DECOMMISSIONED\". \r\n * Mark Shuffle data on the node as unavailable after \"spark.graceful.decommission.shuffedata.leasetimePct\" time. This will ensure that recomputation of missing shuffle partition is done early, rather than reducers failing with a time-consuming FetchFailure. The node state is set to \"SHUFFLE_DECOMMISSIONED\". \r\n * Mark Node as Terminated after the termination time. Now the state of the node is \"TERMINATED\".\r\n * Remove the node entry from Decommission Tracker if the same host name is reused.(This is not uncommon in many public cloud environments). \r\n\r\nThis is the life cycle of the nodes which is decommissioned\r\nDECOMMISSIONING -> EXECUTOR_DECOMMISSIONED -> SHUFFLEDATA_DECOMMISSIONED -> TERMINATED.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd the support to handle the Node Decommissioning for Yarn cluster manger in Spark\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis ports the tests introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/7285eea6839d40cbac15101c633a9a572eb3b603 to master to avoid future regressions.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nA query with Common Table Expressions can cause a stack overflow when it contains a CTE that refers a non-existing table with the same name. The name of the table need to have a database qualifier. This is caused by a couple of things:\r\n\r\n- CTESubstitution runs analysis on the CTE, but this does not throw an exception because the table has a database qualifier. The reason is that we don't fail is because we re-attempt to resolve the relation in a later rule;\r\n- CTESubstitution replace logic does not check if the table it is replacing has a database, it shouldn't replace the relation if it does. So now we will happily replace nonexist.t with t;\r\n\r\nNote that this not an issue for master or the spark-3.0 branch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded regression test to `AnalysisErrorSuite` and

enabled enabled ->  Wrong results\r\nWholeStage disabled -> Returns exception Decimal precision 39 exceeds max precision 38\r\n\r\n**Issues:** \r\n1. Wrong results are returned which is bad \r\n2. Inconsistency between whole stage enabled and disabled. \r\n\r\n**Cause:**\r\nSum does not take care of possibility of overflow for the intermediate steps.  ie the updateExpressions and mergeExpressions.  \r\n\r\n**This PR makes the following changes:**\r\n- Throw exception if there is an decimal overflow when computing the sum.\r\n- This will be consistent with how Spark behaves when whole stage codegen is disabled.\r\n\r\n**Pros:** \r\n- No wrong results\r\n- Consistent behavior between wholestage enabled and disabled\r\n- DB’s have similar behavior, there is precedence\r\n\r\n**Before Fix:** - WRONG RESULTS\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = Seq(\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 1),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 1),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2)).toDF(\"decNum\", \"intNum\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [decNum: decimal(38,18), intNum: int]\r\n\r\nscala> val df2 = df.withColumnRenamed(\"decNum\", \"decNum2\").join(df, \"intNum\").agg(sum(\"decNum\"))\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [sum(decNum): decimal(38,18)]\r\n\r\nscala> df2.show(40,false)\r\n+---------------------------------------+                                       \r\n|sum(decNum)                            |\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n|20000000000000000000.000000000000000000|\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After fix:**\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = Seq(\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 1),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 1),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2),\r\n     |  (BigDecimal(\"10000000000000000000\"), 2)).toDF(\"decNum\", \"intNum\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [decNum: decimal(38,18), intNum: int]\r\n\r\nscala> val df2 = df.withColumnRenamed(\"decNum\", \"decNum2\").join(df, \"intNum\").agg(sum(\"decNum\"))\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [sum(decNum): decimal(38,18)]\r\n\r\nscala> df2.show(40,false)\r\n20/02/18 13:36:19 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 1.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 9)    \r\njava.lang.ArithmeticException: Decimal(expanded,100000000000000000000.000000000000000000,39,18}) cannot be represented as Decimal(38, 18).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed in order to fix the wrong results that are returned for decimal aggregate sum.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nPrior to this fix, user would see wrong results on aggregate sum that involved decimal overflow, but now the user will see exception.

and hive suites were run ok.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-18T21:55:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T17:35:06Z","closed_at":"2020-06-08T17:35:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c55622f63724ac552fa798501d0b6eb2cc2cb1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27629/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27629/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27629/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7aae81c73873b37494e6f6d393717aad068a4a9f","head":{"label":"skambha:decsumthrowexception","ref":"decsumthrowexception","sha":"7aae81c73873b37494e6f6d393717aad068a4a9f","user":{"login":"skambha","id":16563220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTYzMjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16563220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha","html_url":"https://github.com/skambha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49237548,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTIzNzU0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"skambha/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skambha","id":16563220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTYzMjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16563220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha","html_url":"https://github.com/skambha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skambha/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add the `returnLong` parameter to `IntegralDivide`, and pass the value of `spark.sql.legacy.integralDivide.returnBigint` if `returnLong` is not provided on creation of `IntegralDivide`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis allows to avoid the issue when the configuration change between different phases of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJIRA SPARK-28067:  Wrong results are returned for aggregate sum with decimals with whole stage codegen enabled\r\n\r\n**Repro:** \r\nWholeStage enabled enabled ->  Wrong results\r\nWholeStage disabled -> Returns exception Decimal precision 39 exceeds max precision 38\r\n\r\n**Issues:** \r\n1. Wrong results are returned which is bad \r\n2. Inconsistency between whole stage enabled and disabled. \r\n\r\n**Cause:**\r\nSum does not take care of possibility of overflow for the intermediate steps.  ie the updateExpressions and mergeExpressions.  \r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes:\r\n- Add changes to check if overflow occurs for decimal in aggregate Sum and if there is an overflow,  it will return null for the Sum operation when spark.sql.ansi.enabled is false.  \r\n- When spark.sql.ansi.enabled is true, then the sum operation will return an exception if an overflow occurs for the decimal operation in Sum. \r\n- This is keeping it consistent with the behavior defined in spark.sql.ansi.enabled property\r\n\r\n**Before the fix:  Scenario 1:** -

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn ALTER TABLE, a column in ADD COLUMNS can depend on the position of a column that is just being added. For example, for a table with the following schema:\r\n```\r\nroot:\r\n  - a: string\r\n  - b: long\r\n```\r\n, the following should work:\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMNS (x int AFTER a, y int AFTER x) \r\n```\r\nCurrently, the above statement will throw an exception saying that AFTER x cannot be resolved, because x doesn't exist yet. This PR proposes to fix this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix a bug described above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMNS (x int AFTER a, y int AFTER x) \r\n```\r\nworks as expected.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the very first PR for supporting continuous distribution features selectors.\r\nIt adds the algorithm to compute fvalue for continuous features and continuous labels. This algorithm will be used for FValueRegressionSelector.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent Spark only supports the selection of categorical features, while there are many requirements for the selection of continuous distribution features.\r\n\r\nI will add two new selectors:\r\n\r\n1. FValueRegressionSelector for continuous features and continuous labels.\r\n2. ANOVAFValueClassificationSelector for continuous features and categorical labels.\r\n\r\nI will use subtasks to add these two selectors:\r\n\r\nadd FValueRegressionSelector on scala side\r\n\r\n- add FValueRegressionTest, this contains the algorithm to compute FValue\r\n- add FValueRegressionSelector using the above algorithm\r\n- add a common Selector, make FValueRegressionSelector  and ChisqSelector to extend common selector\r\n\r\nadd FValueRegressionSelector on python side\r\nadd samples and doc\r\ndo the same for ANOVAFValueClassificationSelector\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * @param dataset  DataFrame of continuous labels and continuous features.\r\n * @param featuresCol  Name of features column in dataset, of type `Vector` (`VectorUDT`)\r\n * @param labelCol  Name of label column in dataset, of any numerical type\r\n * @return Array containing the SelectionTestResult for every feature against the label.\r\n */\r\nSelectionTest.fValueRegressionTest(dataset: Dataset[_], featuresCol: String, labelCol: String)\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd Unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch caches the fetched list of files in FileStreamSource to avoid re-fetching whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThis improvement would be effective when the source options are being set to below:\r\n \r\n* `maxFilesPerTrigger` is set\r\n* `latestFirst` is set to `false` (default)\r\n\r\nas \r\n\r\n* if `maxFilesPerTrigger` is unset, Spark will process all the new files within a batch\r\n* if `latestFirst` is set to `true`, it intends to process \"latest\" files which Spark has to refresh for every batch\r\n\r\nFetched list of files are filtered against SeenFilesMap before caching - unnecessary files are filtered in this phase. Once we cached the file, we don't check the file again for `isNewFile`, as Spark processes the files in timestamp order so cached files should have equal or later timestamp than latestTimestamp in SeenFilesMap.\r\n\r\nCache is only persisted in memory to simplify the logic - if we support restore cache when restarting query, we should deal with the changes of source options.\r\n\r\nTo avoid tiny set of inputs on the batch due to have tiny unread files (that could be possible when the list operation provides slightly more than the max files), this patch employs the \"lower-bar\" to determine whether it's helpful to retain unread files. Spark will discard unread files and do listing in the next batch if the number of unread files is lower than the specific (20% for now) ratio of max files.\r\n\r\nThis patch will have synergy with SPARK-20568 - while this patch helps to avoid redundant cost of listing, SPARK-20568 will get rid of the cost of listing for processed files. Once the query processes all files in initial load, the cost of listing for the files in initial load will be gone.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark spends huge cost to fetch the list of files from input paths, but restricts the usage of list in a batch. If the streaming query starts from huge input data for various reasons (initial load, reprocessing, etc.) the cost to fetch the files will be applied to all batches as it is unusual to let first microbatch to process all of initial load.\r\n\r\nSPARK-20568 will help to reduce the cost to fetch as processed files will be either deleted or moved outside of input paths, but it still won't help in early phase.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the driver process would require more memory than before if maxFilesPerTrigger is set and latestFirst is set to \"false\" to cache fetched files. Previously Spark only takes some amount from left side of the list and discards remaining - so technically the peak memory would be same, but they can be freed sooner.\r\n\r\nIt may not hurt much, as peak memory is still be similar, and it would require similar amount of memory in any way when maxFilesPerTrigger is unset.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests. Manually tested under the test environment:\r\n\r\n* input files\r\n  * 171,839 files distributed evenly into 24 directories\r\n  * each file contains 200 lines\r\n* query: read from the \"file stream source\" and repartition to 50, and write to the \"file stream sink\"\r\n  * maxFilesPerTrigger is set to 100\r\n\r\n> before applying the patch\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-02-18 at 11 53 12 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/74747932-139a8380-52ab-11ea-8920-26a40070ec32.png)\r\n\r\n> after applying the patch\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-02-18 at 11 56 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/74747860-f5cd1e80-52aa-11ea-89dd-da24e9f6ab00.png)\r\n\r\nThe area of brown color represents \"latestOffset\" where listing operation is performed for FileStreamSource.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26325 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26347\r\n\r\nIt also removes a test added by SPARK-30047. We can't use interval in aggregate now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen we do sum/avg, we need a wider type of input to hold the sum value, to reduce the possibility of overflow. For example, we use long to hold the sum of integral inputs, use double to hold the sum of float/double.\r\n\r\nHowever, we don't have a wider type of interval. Also the semantic is unclear: what if the days field overflows but the months field doesn't? Currently the avg of `1 month` and `2 month` is `1 month 15 days`, which assumes 1 month has 30 days and we should avoid this assumption.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, remove 2 features added in 3.0\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace:\r\n\r\n1. `millisToDays()` by `microsToDays()` which accepts microseconds since the epoch and returns days since the epoch in the specified time zone. The last one is the internal representation of Catalyst's DateType.\r\n2. `daysToMillis()` by `daysToMicros()` which accepts days since the epoch in some time zone and returns the number of microseconds since the epoch. The last one is internal representation of Catalyst's TimestampType.\r\n3. `fromMillis()` by `millisToMicros()`\r\n4. `toMillis()` by `microsToMillis()`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark stores timestamps in microseconds precision, so, there is no actual need to convert dates to milliseconds, and then to microseconds. As examples, look at DateTimeUtils functions `monthsBetween()` and `truncTimestamp()`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites UnivocityParserSuite, DateExpressionsSuite, ComputeCurrentTimeSuite, DateTimeUtilsSuite, DateFunctionsSuite, JsonSuite, StreamSuite.","created_at":"2020-02-18T11:51:23Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:12Z","closed_at":"2020-02-25T15:05:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8df8cb925467a68da1a7ec984166f97c7d001ad3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/17d9566d1dff99503b1364cfc612662d62aaf17c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:replace-millis-by-micros","ref":"replace-millis-by-micros","sha":"17d9566d1dff99503b1364cfc612662d62aaf17c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Move TimeZoneUTC and TimeZoneGMT to DateTimeTestUtils\r\n2. Remove TimeZoneGMT\r\n3. Use ZoneId.systemDefault() instead of defaultTimeZone().toZoneId\r\n4. Alias SQLDate & SQLTimestamp to internal types of DateType and TimestampType\r\n5. Avoid one `*` `DateTimeUtils`.`in fromJulianDay()`\r\n6. Use toTotalMonths in `DateTimeUtils`.`subtractDates()`\r\n7. Remove `julianCommonEraStart`, `timestampToString()`, `microsToEpochDays()`, `epochDaysToMicros()`, `instantToDays()` from `DateTimeUtils`.\r\n8. Make splitDate() private.\r\n9. Remove `def daysToMicros(days: Int): Long` and `def microsToDays(micros: Long): Int`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the common code related to date-time operations, and should improve maintainability. In particular:\r\n \r\n1. TimeZoneUTC and TimeZoneGMT are moved to DateTimeTestUtils because they are used only in tests\r\n2. TimeZoneGMT can be removed because it is equal to TimeZoneUTC\r\n3. After the PR #27494, Spark expressions and DateTimeUtils functions switched to ZoneId instead of TimeZone completely. `defaultTimeZone()` with `TimeZone` as return type is not needed anymore.\r\n4. SQLDate and SQLTimestamp types can be explicitly aliased to internal types of DateType and and TimestampType instead of declaring this in a comment.\r\n5. Avoid one `*` `DateTimeUtils`.`in fromJulianDay()`.\r\n6. Use toTotalMonths in `DateTimeUtils`.`subtractDates()`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-18T06:38:00Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:26:41Z","closed_at":"2020-06-19T05:41:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c045f977cc81ba81d4617460b8328d708ab911c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

So,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\r\nsc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()\r\nSQLContext.getOrCreate(sc).range(10).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nthrows an exception as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/context.py\", line 110, in getOrCreate\r\n    jsqlContext = sc._jvm.SQLContext.getOrCreate(sc._jsc.sc())\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/lib/py4j-0.10.8.1-src.zip/py4j/java_gateway.py\", line 1516, in __getattr__\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JError: org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext.getOrCreate does not exist in the JVM\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/context.py:113: DeprecationWarning: Deprecated in 3.0.0. Use SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() instead.\r\n  DeprecationWarning)\r\n+---+\r\n| id|\r\n+---+\r\n|  0|\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n|  3|\r\n|  4|\r\n|  5|\r\n|  6|\r\n|  7|\r\n|  8|\r\n|  9|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case of the constructor of `SQLContext`, after this PR:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\r\nsc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()\r\nSQLContext(sc)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/context.py:77: DeprecationWarning: Deprecated in 3.0.0. Use SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() instead.\r\n  DeprecationWarning)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo promote to use SparkSession, and keep the API party consistent with Scala side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will show deprecation warning to users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as described above. Unittests were also added.","created_at":"2020-02-18T02:01:06Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:16:09Z","closed_at":"2020-02-19T02:18:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"383cce492b5d6b11ea4c0f2229e09c9b84c4bcb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/172fae3f478582cfab3ec805c6837eff208b8efd","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-30861","ref":"SPARK-30861","sha":"172fae3f478582cfab3ec805c6837eff208b8efd","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace `%` by `Math.floorMod` in `DateTimeUtils.truncTimestamp` for the `HOUR` and `DAY` levels.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issue of incorrect truncation of timestamps before the epoch `1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z` to the `HOUR` and `DAY` levels. For example, timestamps after the epoch are truncated by cutting off the rest part of the timestamp:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('HOUR', '2020-02-11 00:01:02.123'), date_trunc('HOUR', '2020-02-11 00:01:02.789');\r\n2020-02-11 00:00:00\t2020-02-11 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nbut hours in the truncated timestamp before the epoch are increased by 1:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('HOUR', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.123'), date_trunc('HOUR', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.789');\r\n1960-02-11 01:00:00\t1960-02-11 01:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above outputs correct result:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('HOUR', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.123');\r\n1960-02-11 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests to `DateFunctionsSuite`.","created_at":"2020-02-17T17:58:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:45:57Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T13:32:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6253ff2311bc327755964bf4732b13c15eb9cafd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ed3a204482b8c7f5d5d6047de6613d77f89babe","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-hour-day-truc-2.4","ref":"fix-hour-day-truc-2.4","sha":"4ed3a204482b8c7f5d5d6047de6613d77f89babe","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR (a backport of #27543), I propose to replace `%` by `Math.floorMod` in `DateTimeUtils.truncTimestamp` for the `SECOND` and `MINUTE` levels.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issue of incorrect truncation of timestamps before the epoch `1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z` to the `SECOND` and `MINUTE` levels. For example, timestamps after the epoch are truncated by cutting off the rest part of the timestamp:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('SECOND', '2020-02-11 00:01:02.123');\r\n2020-02-11 00:01:02\r\n```\r\nbut seconds in the truncated timestamp before the epoch are increased by 1:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('SECOND', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.123');\r\n1960-02-11 00:01:03\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above outputs correct result:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('SECOND', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.123');\r\n1960-02-11 00:01:02\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests to `DateFunctionsSuite`.","created_at":"2020-02-17T17:12:00Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:45:57Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T03:36:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad0bdbf9467ebea8ca5913ea78c082d20dd9aead","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/755bce549eaa1ee1372e681f2817a7fc859b9c03","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-second-minute-truc-2.4","ref":"fix-second-minute-truc-2.4","sha":"755bce549eaa1ee1372e681f2817a7fc859b9c03","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs discussed on the Jira ticket, this change clears the SQLContext._instantiatedContext class attribute when the SparkSession is stopped. That way, the attribute will be reset with a new, usable SQLContext when a new SparkSession is started.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the underlying SQLContext is instantiated for a SparkSession, the instance is saved as a class attribute and returned from subsequent calls to SQLContext.getOrCreate(). If the SparkContext is stopped and a new one started, the SQLContext class attribute is never cleared so any code which calls SQLContext.getOrCreate() will get a SQLContext with a reference to the old, unusable SparkContext.\r\n\r\nA similar issue was identified and fixed for SparkSession in [SPARK-19055](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19055), but the fix did not change SQLContext as well. I ran into this because mllib still [uses](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/mllib/common.py#L105) SQLContext.getOrCreate() under the hood.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nA new test was added. I verified that the test fails without the included change.","created_at":"2020-02-17T16:58:14Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T03:21:37Z","closed_at":"2020-02-20T03:21:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2ea8b69475e79648ea7ca62e182fb54bf7580246","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27610/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27610/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27610/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fe55515b12c296cd1c3672a8e9b22f94f888dd79","head":{"label":"afavaro:restart-sqlcontext","ref":"restart-sqlcontext","sha":"fe55515b12c296cd1c3672a8e9b22f94f888dd79","user":{"login":"afavaro","id":293985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Mzk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro","html_url":"https://github.com/afavaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241159170,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDExNTkxNzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"afavaro/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"afavaro","id":293985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Mzk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro","html_url":"https://github.com/afavaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afavaro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/afavaro/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR upgrade parquet to 1.11.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBecause Spark lags behind major improvements and cleanups in Avro and also it can remove some extra dependencies (e.g. paranamer and maybe the old versions of jackson that have security vulnerabilities and are still present on Avro 1.8.x and 1.7.x).\r\n\r\nAlso Parquet 1.11.0 needs Avro 1.9.x to run so we can get more issues because of it. For ref. #26804\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nPartially, some parts are still failing so this is for the moment a WIP to get some feedback specially in the situation of the transitive Hive dependencies. PTAL at the Jira ticket [SPARK-27733](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27733) for more details on the dependencies issues.\r\n\r\n### What has been done so far?\r\n- Upgrade Avro version to 1.9.2\r\n- Add explicit xz dependency to spark-avro (It was removed in Avro 1.9.x)\r\n- Remove avro-ipc because that's a transitive dependency of avro-mapred and no\r\ncode on Spark should be using this one directly.\r\nAlso the dependency of avro-mapred depends on avro-ipc tests was removed in\r\n1.8.x so probably that's still there for compatibility with old Hive\r\n- Remove avro.mapred.classifier because it does not exist anymore on Avro 1.9.x\r\n- Remove paranamer because it was removed from Avro (1.9.x) after move to Java 8\r\njackson-module-paranamer does not exist anymore in the code base (Note I could not get rid of the paranamer deps in `dev/deps` because it is coming transitively from jackson-module-scala_2.11.","created_at":"2020-02-17T14:56:36Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T09:42:05Z","closed_at":"2020-02-19T18:30:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61f46c2466bb2ee98043b433ecc477953d264db0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1c78940d9ebb222dd69825db9bc03480167c8a9","head":{"label":"iemejia:SPARK-27733-avro-upgrade","ref":"SPARK-27733-avro-upgrade","sha":"d1c78940d9ebb222dd69825db9bc03480167c8a9","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":240912221,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDA5MTIyMjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"iemejia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd 'path' field to the 'LoadInstanceEnd' ML listener event.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe [LoadInstanceEnd](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/events.scala#L92) ML listener event that is added on the scope of SPARK-23674 has no 'path' field which makes it impossible to determine from what path an ML instance was loaded as well as there is no way to get instance's 'uid' via [LoadInstanceStart](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/events.scala#L84) event.\r\n\r\nThe [LoadInstanceEnd](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/events.scala#L92) must be changed to include 'path' field. Please, refer [SaveInstanceStart](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/events.scala#L101) and [SaveInstanceEnd](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/events.scala#L109) events. Both of them have `path` but [LoadInstanceStart](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/events.scala#L84) and [LoadInstanceEnd](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/events.scala#L92) are not.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested and existing unit test modified.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-17T10:25:44Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T09:08:44Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T09:08:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d4dc48ef1373a7405751fccf534151759611ad6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e488c61202a7684072a223b31c8c36a4044b2ec5","head":{"label":"vladglinsky:SPARK-30851-master","ref":"SPARK-30851-master","sha":"e488c61202a7684072a223b31c8c36a4044b2ec5","user":{"login":"vladglinsky","id":59960853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTYwODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59960853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vladglinsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241070392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDEwNzAzOTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"vladglinsky/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vladglinsky","id":59960853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTYwODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59960853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vladglinsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladglinsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vladglinsky/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to port Scala's bugfix https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/7693 (Scala 2.13) to address https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/10495 issue.\r\n\r\nIn short, it is possible for different product instances having the same children to have the same hash. See:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"id - 1\").queryExecution.analyzed.semanticHash()\r\nres0: Int = -565572825\r\n\r\nscala> spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"id + 1\").queryExecution.analyzed.semanticHash()\r\nres1: Int = -565572825\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt was found during the review of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27565. We should better produce different hash for different objects.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's not identified. Possibly performance related issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unittest was added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-17T04:35:37Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T01:33:24Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T06:29:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a25efb9bf56c28a618a0eddacb5ad7857e530b5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27601/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27601/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27601/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c94fa84ab94a3c189ac6beca8e26f87a276f782d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-30847","ref":"SPARK-30847","sha":"c94fa84ab94a3c189ac6beca8e26f87a276f782d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd `AccumulatorV2` API in `JavaSparkContext` and replace old usage of AccumulatorV2 in Java with the new API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOfficially, we should add any APIs in `SparkContext` to `JavaSparkContext`. And with the API, Java user could directly use `AccumulatorV2`, e.g. `JavaSparkContext.longAccumulator`,  comparing to current way, `JavaSparkContext.sc().longAccumulator`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Java user could directly use `AccumulatorV2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated exist

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake static partition also follows `StoreAssignmentPolicy` when insert into table:\r\n\r\nif `StoreAssignmentPolicy=LEGACY`, using `Cast`;\r\nif `StoreAssignmentPolicy=ANSI | STRIC`, using `AnsiCast`;\r\n\r\nE.g., for the table `t` created by:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table t(a int, b string) using parquet partitioned by (a)\r\n```\r\nand insert values with `StoreAssignmentPolicy=ANSI` using:\r\n```\r\ninsert into t partition(a='ansi') values('ansi')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----+----+\r\n|   b|   a|\r\n+----+----+\r\n|ansi|null|\r\n+----+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, insert will fail by:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NumberFormatException: invalid input syntax for type numeric: ansi\r\n```\r\n\r\n(It should be better if we could use `TableOutputResolver.checkField` to fully follow `StoreAssignmentPolicy`. But since we lost the data type of static partition's value at first place, it's hard to use `TableOutputResolver.checkField`.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI think we should follow `StoreAssignmentPolicy` when insert into table for any columns, including static partition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Rewrite DateTimeUtils methods `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, `getSeconds()`, `getSecondsWithFraction()`, `getMilliseconds()` and `getMicroseconds()` using Java 8 time APIs. This will automatically switch the `Hour`, `Minute`, `Second` and `DatePart` expressions on Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\r\n2. Remove unused methods and constant of DateTimeUtils - `to2001`, `YearZero `, `toYearZero` and `absoluteMicroSecond()`.\r\n3. Remove unused value `timeZone` from `TimeZoneAwareExpression` since all expressions have been migrated to Java 8 time API, and legacy instance of `TimeZone` is not needed any more.\r\n4. Change signatures of modified DateTimeUtils methods, and pass `ZoneId` instead of `TimeZone`. This will allow to avoid unnecessary conversions `TimeZone` -> `String` -> `ZoneId`.\r\n5. Modify tests in `DateTimeUtilsSuite` and in `DateExpressionsSuite` to pass `ZoneId` instead of `TimeZone`. Correct the tests, to pass tested zone id instead of None.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the issue of wrong results returned by the `hour()`, `minute()`, `second()`, `date_part('millisecond', ...)` and `date_part('microsecond', ....)`, see example in [SPARK-30843](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30843).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the results of examples from SPARK-30843:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select hour(timestamp '0010-01-01 00:00:00');\r\n0\r\nspark-sql> select minute(timestamp '0010-01-01 00:00:00');\r\n0\r\nspark-sql> select second(timestamp '0010-01-01 00:00:00');\r\n0\r\nspark-sql> select date_part('milliseconds', timestamp '0010-01-01 00:00:00');\r\n0.000\r\nspark-sql> select date_part('microseconds', timestamp '0010-01-01 00:00:00');\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suites `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite` and `DateFunctionsSuite`.\r\n- Add new tests to `DateExpressionsSuite` and `DateTimeUtilsSuite` for 10 year, like:\r\n```scala\r\n  input = date(10, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, zonePST)\r\n  assert(getHours(input, zonePST) === 0)\r\n```\r\n- Re-run `DateTimeBenchmark` using Amazon EC2.\r\n\r\n| Item | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----|\r\n| Region | us-west-2 (Oregon) |\r\n| Instance | r3.xlarge |\r\n| AMI |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the join operators are not well abstracted, since there are lot of common logic. A trait can be created for easier pattern matching and other future handiness. This is a follow-up PR based on comment \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27509#discussion_r379613391 .\r\n\r\nThis PR refined from the following aspects:\r\n1. Refined structure of all physical join operators\r\n2. Add missing joinType field for CartesianProductExec operator\r\n3. Refined codes related to Explain Formatted\r\n\r\nThe EXPLAIN FORMATTED changes are\r\n1. Converge all join operator `verboseStringWithOperatorId` implementations to `BaseJoinExec`. Join condition displayed, and join keys displayed if it’s not empty.\r\n2. `#1` will add Join condition to `BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec`.\r\n3. `#1` will **NOT** affect `CartesianProductExec`,`SortMergeJoin` and `HashJoin`s, since they already got there override implementation before.\r\n4. Converge all join operator `simpleStringWithNodeId` to `BaseJoinExec`, which will enhance the one line description for `CartesianProductExec` with `JoinType` added.\r\n5. Override `simpleStringWithNodeId` in `BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec` to show `BuildSide`, which was only done for `HashJoin`s before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake the code consistent with other operators and for future handiness of join operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-15T16:07:22Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T06:51:05Z","closed_at":"2020-02-28T10:42:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a046d5a63faf393cf6f329de42c8b592592c560","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27595/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27595/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27595/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/17af74fbf9af7d80aba5c343b7c8cb4fd36fa14b","head":{"label":"Eric5553:RefineJoin","ref":"RefineJoin","sha":"17af74fbf9af7d80aba5c343b7c8cb4fd36fa14b","user":{"login":"Eric5553","id":10626956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553","html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54733158,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDczMzE1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"Eric5553/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Eric5553","id":10626956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553","html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark `ConfigEntry` and `ConfigBuilder` missing Spark version information of each configuration at release. This is not good for Spark user when they visiting the page of spark configuration.\r\nhttp://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html\r\nThe new Spark SQL config docs looks like:\r\n![sql配置截屏](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/74604522-cb882f00-50f9-11ea-8683-57a90f9e3347.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SET -v\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.enabled      false   When true, enable adaptive query execution.\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.nonEmptyPartitionRatioForBroadcastJoin       0.2     The relation with a non-empty partition ratio lower than this config will not be considered as the build side of a broadcast-hash join in adaptive execution regardless of its size.This configuration only has an effect when 'spark.sql.adaptive.enabled' is enabled.\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.optimizeSkewedJoin.enabled   true    When true and adaptive execution is enabled, a skewed join is automatically handled at runtime.\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.optimizeSkewedJoin.skewedPartitionFactor     10      A partition is considered as a skewed partition if its size is larger than this factor multiple the median partition size and also larger than  spark.sql.adaptive.optimizeSkewedJoin.skewedPartitionSizeThreshold\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.optimizeSkewedJoin.skewedPartitionMaxSplits  5       Configures the maximum number of task to handle a skewed partition in adaptive skewedjoin.\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.optimizeSkewedJoin.skewedPartitionSizeThreshold      64MB    Configures the minimum size in bytes for a partition that is considered as a skewed partition in adaptive skewed join.\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.fetchShuffleBlocksInBatch.enabled    true    Whether to fetch the continuous shuffle blocks in batch. Instead of fetching blocks one by one, fetching continuous shuffle blocks for the same map task in batch can reduce IO and improve performance. Note, multiple continuous blocks exist in single fetch request only happen when 'spark.sql.adaptive.enabled' and 'spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.reducePostShufflePartitions.enabled' is enabled, this feature also depends on a relocatable serializer, the concatenation support codec in use and the new version shuffle fetch protocol.\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.localShuffleReader.enabled   true    When true and 'spark.sql.adaptive.enabled' is enabled, this enables the optimization of converting the shuffle reader to local shuffle reader for the shuffle exchange of the broadcast hash join in probe side.\r\nspark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.maxNumPostShufflePartitions  <undefined>     The advisory maximum number of post-shuffle partitions used in adaptive execution. This is used as the initial number of pre-shuffle partitions. By default it equals to spark.sql.shuffle.partitions. This configuration only has an effect when 'spark.sql.adaptive.enabled' and 'spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.reducePostShufflePartitions.enabled' is enabled.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: Because there are so

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn ALTER TABLE, a column in ADD COLUMNS can depend on the position of a column that is just being added. For example, for a table with the following schema:\r\n```\r\nroot:\r\n  - a: string\r\n  - b: long\r\n```\r\n, the following should work:\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMNS (x int AFTER a, y int AFTER x) \r\n```\r\nCurrently, the above statement will throw an exception saying that AFTER x cannot be resolved, because x doesn't exist yet. This PR proposes to fix this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix a bug described above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMNS (x int AFTER a, y int AFTER x) \r\n```\r\nworks as expected.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new

The previous PR for dynamic allocation changes was https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27313\r\n\r\nModified the data structures to store things on a per ResourceProfile basis. \r\n I tried to keep the code changes to a minimum, the main loop that requests just goes through each Resourceprofile and the logic inside for each one stayed very close to the same. \r\nOn submission we now have to give each ResourceProfile a separate yarn Priority because yarn doesn't support asking for containers with different resources at the same Priority. We just use the profile id as the priority level. \r\nUsing a different Priority actually makes things easier when the containers come back to match them again which ResourceProfile they were requested for.\r\nThe expectation is that yarn will only give you a container with resource amounts you requested or more. It should never give you a container if it doesn't satisfy your resource requests.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to see the full feature changes you can look at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27053/files for reference\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor stage level scheduling YARN support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually on YARN cluster and then unit tests.","created_at":"2020-02-14T16:24:18Z","updated_at":"2020-02-28T21:24:34Z","closed_at":"2020-02-28T21:24:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0cd696d5c6d6b927c388997ec7f604e778a160ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bd3509c044d3eca6895815a0e1347b97c1019f29","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-29149","ref":"SPARK-29149","sha":"bd3509c044d3eca6895815a0e1347b97c1019f29","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6.

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs discussed in Jira, SparkSql's map hashcodes depends on their order of insertion which is not consistent with the normal scala behaviour which might confuse users. \r\nCode snippet from JIRA : \r\n```\r\nval a = spark.createDataset(Map(1->1, 2->2) :: Nil)\r\nval b = spark.createDataset(Map(2->2, 1->1) :: Nil)\r\n\r\n// Demonstration of how Scala Map equality is unaffected by insertion order:\r\nassert(Map(1->1, 2->2).hashCode() == Map(2->2, 1->1).hashCode())\r\nassert(Map(1->1, 2->2) == Map(2->2, 1->1))\r\nassert(a.first() == b.first())\r\n\r\n// In contrast, this will print two different hashcodes:\r\nprintln(Seq(a, b).map(_.selectExpr(\"hash(*)\").first()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso `MapType` is prohibited for aggregation / joins / equality comparisons #7819 and set operations #17236. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Now users cannot use hash functions on elements of `mapType`. To restore the previous behaviour set `spark.sql.legacy.useHashOnMapType` to true.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT added.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDefine a new enumeration `LegacyBehaviorPolicy` in SQLConf, it will be used as the common value for result change configs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDuring API auditing for the 3.0 release, we found several new approaches that will change the results silently. For these features, we need a common three-value config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, original config `spark.sql.legacy.ctePrecedence.enabled` change to `spark.sql.legacy.ctePrecedencePolicy`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe only change is that I've added a column check when using insertInto. Now it checks that the query dataFrame has the same column names as the target table.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThey are needed because it helps a lot when you have a lot of columns, and if you have one missing the current message doesn't tell you which one. \r\nAlso insertInto just check that the number of columns of both are the same, but not the order or anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a test case just to show the new behaviour, obviously there will be more test added depending on the comments\r\n\r\nJira ->

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to convert the attribute name of `StringStartsWith` pushed down to the Parquet datasource to column reference via the `nameToParquetField` map. Similar conversions are performed for other source filters pushed down to parquet.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the bug described in [SPARK-30826](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30826). The query from an external table:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (col STRING)\r\nUSING parquet\r\nOPTIONS (path '$path')\r\n```\r\ncreated on top of written parquet files by `Seq(\"42\").toDF(\"COL\").write.parquet(path)` returns wrong empty result:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE col LIKE '4%'\").show\r\n+---+\r\n|col|\r\n+---+\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes the result is correct for the example above:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE col LIKE '4%'\").show\r\n+---+\r\n|col|\r\n+---+\r\n| 42|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to

commit is published into the public domain.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn analogy to `python/docs/Makefile`, which has\r\n> export PYTHONPATH=$(realpath ..):$(realpath ../lib/py4j-0.10.8.1-src.zip)\r\n\r\non line 10, this PR adds\r\n> set PYTHONPATH=..;..\\lib\\py4j-0.10.8.1-src.zip\r\n\r\nto `make2.bat`.\r\n\r\nSince there is no `realpath` in default installations of Windows, I left the relative paths unresolved. Per the instructions on how to build docs, `make.bat` is supposed to be run from `python/docs` as the working directory, so this should probably not cause issues (`%BUILDDIR%` is a relative path as well.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen building the PySpark documentation on Windows, by changing directory to `python/docs` and running `make.bat` (which runs `make2.bat`), the majority of the documentation may not be built if pyspark is not in the default `%PYTHONPATH%`. Sphinx then reports that `pyspark` (and possibly dependencies) cannot be imported.\r\n\r\nIf `pyspark` is in the default `%PYTHONPATH%`, I suppose it is that version of `pyspark` – as opposed to the version found above the `python/docs` directory – that is considered when building the documentation, which may result in documentation that does not correspond to the development version one is trying to build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests on my Windows 10 machine. Additional tests with other environments very welcome!\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-13T21:24:07Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T04:50:10Z","closed_at":"2020-02-14T04:49:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f27e306f7f17b2641bb4f643c3baf4ce00a4e399","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27569/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27569/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27569/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bf479715488c9984874612bae3287a52b91ca2d2","head":{"label":"DavidToneian:SPARK-30823","ref":"SPARK-30823","sha":"bf479715488c9984874612bae3287a52b91ca2d2","user":{"login":"DavidToneian","id":25615622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidToneian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239858085,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk4NTgwODU=","name":"spark","full_name":"DavidToneian/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DavidToneian","id":25615622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidToneian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DavidToneian/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChecking of all containers in the executor pod when reporting executor status.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA pod remains \"running\" as long as there is at least one running container. This prevents Spark from noticing when a container has failed in an executor pod with multiple containers. If either the executor process or one of its sidecars has failed, it needs to be rescheduled.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n(not tested yet, will edit later)","created_at":"2020-02-13T21:02:59Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T23:59:03Z","closed_at":"2020-08-24T00:40:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49fbf4dbfee7b8e4e51df4e3f4d296d9092c0e05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27568/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27568/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27568/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0b89736d7e74e16e9ea6e6b35e5d69e9e32cd944","head":{"label":"khogeland:handle-sidecar-failure","ref":"handle-sidecar-failure","sha":"0b89736d7e74e16e9ea6e6b35e5d69e9e32cd944","user":{"login":"khogeland","id":1495099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1495099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland","html_url":"https://github.com/khogeland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195895859,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU4OTU4NTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"khogeland/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khogeland","id":1495099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1495099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland","html_url":"https://github.com/khogeland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khogeland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khogeland/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change proposes ignoring a terminating semicolon from queries submitted by the user (if included) instead of raising a parse exception.\r\n\r\n# Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen a user submits a directly executable SQL statement terminated with a semicolon, they receive an `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException` of `extraneous input ';' expecting <EOF>`. SQL-92 describes a direct SQL statement as having the format of `<directly executable statement> <semicolon>` and the majority of SQL implementations either require the semicolon as a statement terminator, or make it optional (meaning not raising an exception when it's included, seemingly in recognition that it's a common behavior).\r\n\r\n# Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR added two DeveloperApis to the Dataset[T] class. Both methods are just exposing lower-level methods to the Dataset[T] class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThey are useful for checking whether two dataframes are the same when implementing dataframe caching in python, and also get a unique ID. It's easier to use if we wrap the lower-level APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n```\r\nscala> val df1 = Seq((1,2),(4,5)).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\ndf1:

python.\r\n\r\nNote: comments are copied from the corresponding lower-level APIs.\r\nNote: There are some issues to be fixed that would improve the hash collision rate:

This is caused by a couple of things:\r\n- `CTESubstitution` runs analysis on the CTE, but this does not throw an exception because the table has a database qualifier. The reason is that we don't fail is because we re-attempt to resolve the relation in a later rule;\r\n- `CTESubstitution` replace logic does not check if the table it is replacing has a database, it shouldn't replace the relation if it does. So now we will happily replace `nonexist.t` with `t`;\r\n\r\nNote that this **not** an issue for master or the spark-3.0 branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by checking whether the relation name does not have a database, and it also reverses the transformation order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded regression test to `DataFrameSuite`.","created_at":"2020-02-13T14:25:43Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T22:40:35Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T22:40:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c7ba1d1a7a823986ce6b9ef8f1d4c4d7492bdef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27562/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27562/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27562/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/797cd1e4771ba141f3e3f5071638b13d6c6fbd17","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-30811","ref":"SPARK-30811","sha":"797cd1e4771ba141f3e3f5071638b13d6c6fbd17","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support JDK11 test in K8S integration tests. \r\n- This is an update in testing framework instead of individual tests.\r\n- This will enable JDK11 runtime test when you didn't installed JDK11 on your local system.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.0.0 adds JDK11 support, but K8s integration tests use JDK8 until now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a dev-only test-related PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is irrelevant to Jenkins UT, but Jenkins K8S IT (JDK8) should pass.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27559#issuecomment-585903489 (JDK8 Passed)\r\n\r\nAnd, manually do the following for JDK11 test.\r\n```\r\n$ NO_MANUAL=1 ./dev/make-distribution.sh --r --pip --tgz -Phadoop-3.2 -Pkubernetes\r\n$ resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/dev/dev-run-integration-tests.sh --java-image-tag 11-jre-slim --spark-tgz $PWD/spark-*.tgz\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm kubespark/spark:1318DD8A-2B15-4A00-BC69-D0E90CED235B /usr/local/openjdk-11/bin/java --version | tail -n1\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe only need to do aggregate evaluation once per group in `UnboundedWindowFunctionFrame`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, in `UnboundedWindowFunctionFrame.write`，it re-evaluate the processor for each row in a group, which is not necessary in fact which I'll address later. It hurts performance when the evaluation is time-consuming (for example, Percentile's eval need to sort its buffer and do some calculation). In our production, there is a percentile with window operation sql,  it costs more than 10 hours in SparkSQL while 10min in Hive.\r\n\r\nIn fact, `UnboundedWindowFunctionFrame` can be treated as `SlidingWindowFunctionFrame` with `lbound = UnboundedPreceding` and `ubound = UnboundedFollowing`, just as its comments. In that case, `SlidingWindowFunctionFrame` also only do evaluation once for each group.\r\n\r\nThe performance issue can be reproduced by running the follow scripts in local spark-shell\r\n```\r\nspark.range(100*100).map(i => (i, \"India\")).toDF(\"uv\", \"country\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"test\")\r\nsql(\"select uv, country, percentile(uv, 0.95) over (partition by country) as ptc95 from test\").collect.foreach(println)\r\n```\r\nBefore this patch, the sql costs **128048 ms**.\r\nWith this patch,  the sql costs **3485 ms**.\r\n\r\nIf we increase the data size to 1000*1000 for example, then spark cannot even produce result without this patch(I'v waited for several hours).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UT\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-13T08:07:04Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T20:13:07Z","closed_at":"2020-02-17T17:16:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e1c7cae0e96e935f49420da35c3b446ec4972c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8cccd948d75e45e711fc62639f65104dc2aeec9","head":{"label":"WangGuangxin:windows","ref":"windows","sha":"f8cccd948d75e45e711fc62639f65104dc2aeec9","user":{"login":"WangGuangxin","id":1312321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTIzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1312321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin","html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163655040,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM2NTUwNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"WangGuangxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WangGuangxin","id":1312321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTIzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1312321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin","html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are three changes in this PR:\r\n1. use Summarizer instead of MultivariateOnlineSummarizer in Aggregator test suites (similar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26396)\r\n2. Put common code in ```Summarizer.getRegressionSummarizers``` and ```Summarizer.getClassificationSummarizers```.\r\n3. Move ```MultiClassSummarizer``` from ```LogisticRegression``` to ```ml.stat``` (this seems to be a better place since ```MultiClassSummarizer``` is not only used by ```LogisticRegression``` but also several other classes).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMinimize code duplication and improve performance\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting test suites.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes sure AQE is either enabled or disabled for the entire query, including the main query and all subqueries.\r\nCurrently there are unsupported queries by AQE, e.g., queries that contain DPP filters. We need to make sure that if the main query is unsupported, none of the sub-queries should apply AQE, otherwise it can lead to performance regressions due to missed opportunity of sub-query reuse.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo get rid of potential perf regressions when AQE is turned on.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated DynamicPartitionPruningSuite:\r\n1. Removed the existing workaround `withSQLConf(SQLConf.ADAPTIVE_EXECUTION_ENABLED.key, \"false\")`\r\n2. Added `DynamicPartitionPruningSuiteAEOn` and `DynamicPartitionPruningSuiteAEOff` to enable testing this suite with AQE on and off options\r\n3. Added a check in `checkPartitionPruningPredicate` to verify that the subqueries are always in sync with the main query in terms of whether AQE is applied.","created_at":"2020-02-12T22:18:35Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T03:24:39Z","closed_at":"2020-02-14T03:21:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1f59c12b2b32f4114724ed815a0d5cf1e3503c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27554/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27554/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27554/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1adf99ec3da6b9dff7c2c308bd0794c0867e9f50","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-30801","ref":"spark-30801","sha":"1adf99ec3da6b9dff7c2c308bd0794c0867e9f50","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

commit is published into the public domain.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes the documentation of `DataFrameReader`, `DataFrameWriter`, `DataStreamReader`, and `DataStreamWriter`, where attributes of other classes were misrepresented as functions. Additionally, creation of hyperlinks across modules was fixed in these instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe old state produced documentation that suggested invalid usage of PySpark objects (accessing attributes as though they were callable.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, except for improved documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo test added; documentation build runs through.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-12T21:00:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T02:01:34Z","closed_at":"2020-02-14T02:00:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0cd49c978a00ab1ae3025429bdb5b6f938b16cb3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d0f6edbcadc83092eb0e9e7000de1f133fe8fa1","head":{"label":"DavidToneian:docfix-DataFrameReader-DataFrameWriter-DataStreamReader-DataStreamWriter","ref":"docfix-DataFrameReader-DataFrameWriter-DataStreamReader-DataStreamWriter","sha":"6d0f6edbcadc83092eb0e9e7000de1f133fe8fa1","user":{"login":"DavidToneian","id":25615622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidToneian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239858085,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk4NTgwODU=","name":"spark","full_name":"DavidToneian/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DavidToneian","id":25615622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidToneian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidToneian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DavidToneian/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a config for Dynamic Partition Pruning subquery duplication and turns it off by default due to its potential performance regression.\r\nWhen planning a DPP filter, it seeks to reuse the broadcast exchange relation if the corresponding join is a BHJ with the filter relation being on the build side, otherwise it will either opt out or plan the filter as an un-reusable subquery duplication based on the cost estimate. However, the cost estimate is not accurate and only takes into account the table scan overhead, thus adding an un-reusable subquery duplication DPP filter can sometimes cause perf regression.\r\nThis PR turns off the subquery duplication DPP filter by:\r\n1. adding a config `spark.sql.optimizer.dynamicPartitionPruning.reuseBroadcastOnly` and setting it `true` by default.\r\n2. removing the existing meaningless config `spark.sql.optimizer.dynamicPartitionPruning.reuseBroadcast` since we always want to reuse broadcast results if possible. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nNo v2 command supports temp views and the `ResolveCatalogs`/`ResolveSessionCatalog` framework is designed with this assumption.\r\n\r\nHowever, `ResolveSessionCatalog` needs to fallback to v1 commands, which do support temp views (e.g. CACHE TABLE). To work around it, we add a hack in `CatalogAndIdentifier`, which does not expand the given identifier with current namespace if the catalog is session catalog.\r\n\r\nThis works fine in most cases, as temp views should take precedence over tables during lookup. So if `CatalogAndIdentifier` returns a single name \"t\", the v1 commands can still resolve it to temp views correctly, or resolve it to table \"default.t\" if temp view doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nHowever, if users write `spark_catalog.t`, it shouldn't be resolved to temp views as temp views don't belong to any catalog. `CatalogAndIdentifier` can't distinguish between `spark_catalog.t` and `t`, so the caller side may mistakenly resolve `spark_catalog.t` to a temp view.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix this issue by\r\n1. remove the hack in `CatalogAndIdentifier`, and clearly document that this shouldn't be used to resolve temp views.\r\n2. update `ResolveSessionCatalog` to explicitly look up temp views first before calling `CatalogAndIdentifier`, for v1 commands that support temp views.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid releasing a behavior that we should not support.\r\n\r\nRemoving the hack also fixes the problem we hit in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27532/files#diff-57b3d87be744b7d79a9beacf8e5e5eb2R937\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, now it's not allowed to refer to a temp view with `spark_catalog` prefix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to the PR #26956. In #26956, the patch proposed to preserve path permission when truncating table. When setting up original ACLs, we need to set user/group/other permission as ACL entries too, otherwise if the path doesn't have default user/group/other ACL entries, ACL API will complain an error `Invalid ACL: the user, group and other entries are required.`.\r\n\r\n In short this change makes sure:\r\n\r\n1. Permissions for user/group/other are always kept into ACLs to work with ACL API.\r\n2. Other custom ACLs are still kept after TRUNCATE TABLE (#26956 did this).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, `TRUNCATE TABLE` will get an error when setting up ACLs if there is no default default user/group/other ACL entries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdate unit test.\r\n\r\nManual test on dev Spark cluster.\r\n\r\nSet ACLs for a table path without default user/group/other ACL entries:\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -setfacl --set 'user:liangchi:rwx,user::rwx,group::r--,other::r--' /user/hive/warehouse/test.db/test_truncate_table\r\n\r\nhdfs dfs -getfacl /user/hive/warehouse/test.db/test_truncate_table\r\n# file: /user/hive/warehouse/test.db/test_truncate_table\r\n# owner: liangchi\r\n# group: supergroup\r\nuser::rwx\r\nuser:liangchi:rwx\r\ngroup::r--\r\nmask::rwx\r\nother::r--\r\n```\r\nThen run `sql(\"truncate table test.test_truncate_table\")`, it works by normally truncating the table and preserve ACLs.","created_at":"2020-02-12T09:24:51Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:38:21Z","closed_at":"2020-02-12T22:27:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b16135e15a854c63132e802de1203a04ce2e18d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27548/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27548/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27548/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7568db7d05b6f873b4ee63c5324ebe70ba99a2cf","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-truncate-table-permission","ref":"fix-truncate-table-permission","sha":"7568db7d05b6f873b4ee63c5324ebe70ba99a2cf","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange BLAS for part of level-1 routines(axpy, dot, scal(double, denseVector)) from java implementation to NativeBLAS when vector size>256\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn current ML BLAS.scala, all level-1 routines are fixed to use java\r\nimplementation. But NativeBLAS(intel MKL, OpenBLAS) can bring up to 11X\r\nperformance improvement based on performance test which apply direct\r\ncalls against these methods. We should provide a way to allow user take\r\nadvantage of NativeBLAS for level-1 routines. Here we do it through\r\nswitching to NativeBLAS for these methods from f2jBLAS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n Yes, methods axpy, dot, scal in level-1 routines will switch to NativeBLAS when it has more than nativeL1Threshold(fixed value 256) elements and will fallback to f2jBLAS if native BLAS is not properly configured in system.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPerf test direct calls level-1

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make the `code` string interpolator treat escapes the same way as Scala's builtin `StringContext.s()` string interpolator. This will remove the need for an ugly workaround in `Like` expression's codegen.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe `code()` string interpolator in Spark SQL's code generator should treat escapes like Scala's builtin `StringContext.s()` interpolator, i.e. it should treat escapes in the code parts, and should not treat escapes in the input arguments.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```scala\r\nval arg = \"This is an argument.\"\r\nval str = s\"This is string part 1. $arg This is string part 2.\"\r\nval code = code\"This is string part 1. $arg This is string part 2.\"\r\nassert(code.toString == str)\r\n```\r\nWe should expect the `code()` interpolator to produce the same result as the `StringContext.s()` interpolator, where only escapes in the string parts should be treated, while the args should be kept verbatim.\r\n\r\nBut in the current implementation, due to the eager folding of code parts and literal input args, the escape treatment is incorrectly done on both code parts and literal args.\r\nThat causes a problem when an arg contains escape sequences and wants to preserve that in the final produced code string. For example, in `Like` expression's codegen, there's an ugly workaround for this bug:\r\n```scala\r\n      // We need double escape to avoid org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException.\r\n      // '\\\\' will cause exception 'Single quote must be backslash-escaped in character literal'.\r\n      // '\\\"' will cause exception 'Line break in literal not allowed'.\r\n      val newEscapeChar = if (escapeChar == '\\\"' || escapeChar == '\\\\') {\r\n        s\"\"\"\\\\\\\\\\\\$escapeChar\"\"\"\r\n      } else {\r\n        escapeChar\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit test case in
