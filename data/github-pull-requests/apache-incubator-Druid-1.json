Description\r\n\r\nThere may be some circumstances where we want to change the config of the task pod, such as changing the cpu requests/limits of default task pods by editing the base YAML pod template file. In my case, I am editing something that looks like this [example ConfigMap](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/extensions-contrib/k8s-jobs/#custom-template-pod-adapter), to directly make changes to the pod templates. \r\n\r\nHowever, since the code only updates `HashMap<String, PodTemplate> templates` during Overlord initialization, the changes are not immediately reflected.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to solve this problem and make Druid more adaptable in Kubernetes environments. Instead of internally keeping track of the deserialized PodTemplates we have read from all template files, we will now run the deserialization process whenever a new Task Pod is to be created. Do note this PR does not support reading from newly created pod template files. (e.g. If we create a `newPodTemplate.yaml`, we will still need to let the Overlord run template initialization for the new file to take effect).\r\n\r\nThe original intention of fail-fast for invalid pod templates is retained by validating all of the pod templates defined during initialization. \r\n\r\n#### Performance Considerations\r\nGiven that a ingestion task will create `n` task pods, and we have `k` pod templates defined, we will be reading from the pod template `n + k` times instead of just `k` times. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nYou can now configure Kubernetes task pod specifications by directly editing existing pod templates.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `PodTemplateSelectStrategy.java`\r\n * `SelectorBasedPodTemplateSelectStrategy.java`\r\n * `TaskTypePodTemplateSelectStrategy.java`\r\n * `DynamicConfigPodTemplateSelector.java`\r\n * `PodTemplateTaskAdapter.java`\r\n * `SelectorBasedPodTemplateSelectStrategyTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR has 4 parts:\r\n1. Creation of a new workflow\r\n2. Moving unit tests (phase 1) to the new workflow\r\n3. Moving unit tests (phase 2) to a weekly cron workflow\r\n4. New reporting mechanism\r\n\r\nI'll describe the above 4 parts separately below.\r\n\r\n## Creation of a new workflow\r\n\r\nThis PR adds 2 new workflow yml files:\r\n- `ci.yml`\r\n- `worker.yml`\r\n\r\nEventually, `ci.yml` is expected to be the new starting point for our entire CI workflow. However, right now, since we're migrating only the unit tests (phase 1) to use ci.yml, it's not the starting point for now (during this transition of individual parts one-by-one to the new workflow).\r\n\r\n`ci.yml` is responsible for orchestrating the workflows with the help of a `worker.yml`.\r\n\r\n`worker.yml` is responsible for doing the actual work, as per requested by `ci.yml` via the input arguments.\r\n\r\nMotivation behind this change:\r\n- Currently, our workflows are spread across a bunch of yml files, making it difficult to understand the flows.\r\n- Having a central file `ci.yml` will make it much easier to understand the dependency graph between all the different workflows.\r\n- `worker.yml` takes a `script` as one of the input args. The idea behind this design is to make it easy for folks to be able to run the same scripts locally, whenever they require to run the workflows locally (during development or debugging). This becomes difficult to figure out when we have a bunch of yml files and we're passing around input args through them, hence we wanted to keep it as simple as possible to understand and reproduce locally.\r\n\r\n## Moving unit tests (phase 1) to the new workflow\r\n\r\nThe unit tests (phase 1) that was being run via `unit-tests.yml`, `reusable-unit-tests.yml` and `unit_tests_script.sh` - has been updated to run via `ci.yml`, `worker.yml` and `run-unit-tests.sh`. As a result, `unit-tests.yml`, `reusable-unit-tests.yml` and `unit_tests_script.sh` have also been removed since they're unused now (the same has been done for unit tests phase 2, as can be read in the next section).\r\n\r\nCurrently, we were running unit tests for 4 different set of modules: `indexing`, `processing`, `server`, and \"everything else\". This resulted in longer duration of the job, with processing modules taking 50+ minutes, for example. Also, the design with \"everything else\" wouldn't scale in the long term, since it's everything that isn't covered in the other 3 modules.\r\n\r\nThis design has been updated to run using regex patterns, on the starting character of the test class. We have the following in `ci.yml`:\r\n```\r\n  matrix:\r\n    Dtest: [ \"A*,B*\", \"C*\", \"D*,E*,F*\", \"G*,H*\", \"I*,J*\", \"K*,L*\", \"M*,N*\", \"O*,P*\", \"Q*\", \"R*\", \"S*\", \"T*,U*\", \"V*,W*,X*,Y*,Z*\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence, all unit test classes starting with `A` and `B` gets run as part of a single job, across all modules. Similar thing happens for `C`, similar for `D`,`E`,`F`, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe character groupings have been done to try and avoid skewness across them. This also allows scaling in the long term, as well as the flexibility to tune these groupings, if and when needed.\r\n\r\n**With this change, most groups finish in around 15-18 minutes, and a few of them finishing in around 25 minutes.**\r\n\r\nThe reporting mechanism for this design of running unit tests is being covered in the `New reporting mechanism` section below.\r\n\r\n## Moving unit tests (phase 2) to a weekly cron workflow\r\n\r\nFor context, the unit tests phase 1 are being run against JDK 17, whereas the unit tests phase 2 are being run against JDKs 11 and 21.\r\n\r\nIt's very rare for a test to have different result in JDK 17 versus JDK 11/21, hence it is redundant to run unit tests phase 2 on every commit on every PR.\r\n\r\nHence, the unit tests phase 2 have been removed from the regular PR workflow, and instead have been added as a weekly cron workflow. This ensures that we are still running them once a week, and allows us to track failures, if any (which we ideally don't expect to have).\r\n\r\nUnit tests phase 2 have also been updated to use the new workflow files and the new regex pattern approach, as done for unit tests phase 1.\r\n\r\n## New reporting mechanism\r\n\r\nThere are a few aspects to this:\r\n1. The unit test jobs are called as success when they were able to run all the tests as per the input parameters, even if some of the tests fail. This can be seen in `ci.yml` where we are passing `-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true` while running unit tests.\r\n2. All unit test jobs upload the surefire reports to individual artifact, with the same prefix.\r\n3. We have a `reporting-unit-test-failures` job, which downloads all the artifacts uploaded in point (2) - hence gathering all the individual surefire reports in the same place/hierarchy, and then runs a reporter (`mikepenz/action-junit-report@v5`) against those gathered surefire reports. I'll add some sample run links below for how the report looks like.\r\n4. We have a `reporting-jacoco-coverage-failures` job, which does something similar, and then uses `create-jacoco-coverage-report.sh` to create a jacoco report. This new script is mostly derived (with some simplifications) from the existing `unit_tests_script.sh` we had, but the overall logic and the way of reporting (that is, the final output) is the same as what we had currently.\r\n\r\nSome examples for the unit test report:\r\n1. The failed tests can be seen in the `Summary` section of the workflow run: https://github.com/Akshat-Jain/druid/actions/runs/13152426940/attempts/1#summary-36703177495\r\n2. The failed tests can also be seen in the `report-unit-test-failures` job run itself: https://github.com/Akshat-Jain/druid/actions/runs/13152426940/job/36703177495 (you need to expand the `Publish results` dropdown).\r\n\r\nAttaching sample images for both of the above examples below, for quicker reference:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f7d173d-6499-4da4-8bd1-2c0d6533b745\" />\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>Image for (1)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1716\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/258a6521-df46-4efc-ac27-d5de397caad2\" />\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>Image for (2)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16386 changed the docker file to use the canonical hostname instead of ip by default.

For example, #7943 is an instance of this bug.\r\n\r\nThis patch also includes a fix for an issue on the writer for compressed multi-value string columns, V3CompressedVSizeColumnarMultiIntsSerializer, where it would use the same base filename for both the offset and values sections. This bug would only be triggered for segments in excess of 500 million rows. When a segment has fewer rows than that, it could potentially have a values section that needs to be split over multiple files, but the offset is never more than 4 bytes per row. This bug was triggered by the new tests, which use a smaller fileSizeLimit.\r\n\r\nThis patch also removes the 2-arg overload of `GenericIndexed#read` (which doesn't accept a `SmooshedFileMapper`). The 3-arg one can be used with the `SmooshedFileMapper` arg set to `null` if the caller really doesn't want to use a mapper. However, production callers generally do.","created_at":"2025-01-31T20:16:13Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T18:12:35Z","closed_at":"2025-02-03T18:12:32Z","merged_at":"2025-02-03T18:12:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"0be98151725458f4056951e366acffbc03223f38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #17684.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n* Custom Histogram buckets can now be configured for `timer` metrics from Prometheus emitter  \r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DimensionsAndCollector.java`\r\n * `Metrics.java`\r\n * `MetricsTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Segment Load Status Fetcher: Enhanced Query Handling and Code Refactoring\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis PR introduces improvements and refactoring to the `SegmentLoadStatusFetcher` in the Apache Druid project. The changes aim to improve code maintainability, enhance performance in segment loading operations, and ensure more reliable status checks when waiting for segments to load.\r\n\r\nKey Changes:\r\n1. Enhanced Query Handling:\r\n   - Improved SQL query logic to handle additional segment scenarios, including on-demand and unknown segment types.  \r\n   - Ensured efficient filtering and robust conditional handling to better track segment loading.\r\n\r\n2. Status Update Logic:\r\n   - Simplified and optimized the status update mechanism.  \r\n   - Ensured accurate updates for segment status during the wait period, including proper tracking of states (success, failure, timeout).\r\n\r\n3. Exception Handling Improvements:  \r\n   - Enhanced error handling during load status fetch operations.  \r\n   - Updated logic to avoid unnecessary task failures if an exception occurs during the segment wait.\r\n\r\n4. Refactoring for Code Readability:\r\n   - Reorganized methods to improve readability and reduce redundant operations.  \r\n   - Refactored the version condition creation logic to minimize computational overhead.\r\n\r\n5. Thread Management:\r\n   - Properly shutdown executor service to prevent resource leaks.  \r\n   - Added additional safety checks during concurrent operations.\r\n\r\nTesting:*\r\n- Verified the query execution against multiple broker scenarios.  \r\n- Conducted unit tests to ensure accurate segment status updates.  \r\n- Stress-tested the system to confirm that timeout and exception handling worked as expected.\r\n\r\nBackward Compatibility: \r\nThe changes maintain backward compatibility with existing segment loading workflows in Apache Druid.\r\n\r\nReviewer Notes: \r\n- Review the SQL query and version condition logic for correctness and efficiency.  \r\n- Validate exception handling mechanisms for edge cases.  \r\n- Ensure thread handling improvements are correctly implemented.  \r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-29T17:55:02Z","updated_at":"2025-02-04T05:32:06Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9e0f14716d9c6c16fb18ff9cf98c376f89305e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

property allows interval-based limiting of the number of segments killed, as well as the already-existing segment-count-based limiting. This is useful because the kill task retrieves payloads of *all* active segments that fall within the kill interval, which can be a large number.\r\n\r\nThe new default is 30 days, which seems reasonable for common situations.\r\n\r\nRelease notes text:\r\n\r\n**Automatic kill tasks limited to 30 days by default**\r\n\r\nThe Coordinator can optionally issue kill tasks for cleaning up unused segments. Starting with this release, individual kill tasks are by default limited to processing 30 days or fewer worth of segments per task. This improves performance of the individual kill tasks.\r\n\r\nThe previous behavior (no limit on interval per kill task) can be restored by setting `druid.coordinator.kill.maxInterval = P0D`.","created_at":"2025-01-29T10:14:14Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T16:56:24Z","closed_at":"2025-01-30T04:27:05Z","merged_at":"2025-01-30T04:27:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"100d9ef822722a8c342ceca3061baffc3b7341b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR enables querying policy-enabled table in MSQ. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DataSourceAnalysis`, `getBaseTableDataSource` can now return the base of `RestrictedDataSource`. This is a more robust solution than using the underlying table as base.\r\n * `DruidQuery`, can also be created by `withPolicy`, which just applies policy restriction to the original `query`. \r\n * `MSQTaskQueryMaker` would apply restrictions on `DruidQuery`, instead of throw permission error.\r\n * `DataSourcePlan` can handle `RestrictedDataSource`.\r\n * a new class `RestrictedInputNumberDataSource`, which basically wraps a NumberDataSource with a policy, and its `SegmentMapFn` can be used to create a `RestrictedSegment`.\r\n * `RunWorkOrder`, try to make a few refactors to make the code clear, no behavior change. `ShufflePipelineBuilder.build()`, it was not clear before that the channel future should only be returned when the resultFuture is ready. Also, the sanity check is moved to `OutputChannels`.\r\n * `BaseLeafFrameProcessorFactory.makeProcessors()`. Previously, `makeSegmentMapFnProcessor` can return null. After this PR, it cannot. The difference is that now the SegmentMapFn from query.dataSource is handled in `ChainedProcessorManager` for all query (was just join query before). \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nFixes issue noticed in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16577#issuecomment-2611993686.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the search query was using `ColumnCapabilities.hasBitmapIndexes()` to check if it could use the indexes strategy, which used to be ok when there were only indexes on string columns and so every column with that set would also have a `DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex`, but is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nTo fix, the search query now explicitly checks for columns having a `DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex` available since that is what the 'use indexes' strategy requires.\r\n\r\nThe added test fails without the code changes in this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nThe Overlord performs several metadata operations on the tables `druid_segments` and `druid_pendingSegments`,\r\nsuch as segment commit, allocation, upgrade and mark used / unused.\r\n\r\nSegment allocation, in particular, involves several reads/writes to the metadata store and can often become a bottleneck,\r\ncausing ingestion to slow down. This effect is particularly pronounced when streaming ingestion is enabled for\r\nmultiple datasources or if there is a lot of late arriving data.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds an in-memory segment cache to the Overlord to speed up all segment metadata operations.\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n\r\n- All segment metadata writes are performed by the Overlord (added in #17545 )\r\n- A segment metadata transaction involves only a single datasource.\r\n- A segment metadata transaction does not read what it writes.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\n- Add Overlord runtime property `druid.manager.segments.useCache` to enable cache\r\n- Keep cache disabled by default\r\n- When cache is enabled, read metadata from cache and write metadata to both metadata store and cache\r\n- Poll metadata store periodically in case any metadata update did not make it to the cache (should not happen under stable operational conditions)\r\n- Non-leader Overlords also poll the metadata store and keep the cache ready in case of failover\r\n- Upon becoming leader, Overlord needs to finish one poll successfully before cache can be used in transactions\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><h4>Segment metadata transaction with cache enabled</h4></summary>\r\n\r\n- If cache is not enabled, fall back to old flow\r\n- If not leader, do not proceed\r\n- If cache is waiting for sync to finish after becoming leader, block until cache is ready\r\n- Acquire a lock on cache to ensure that another thread does not update it while we are reading from it.\r\n- Start transaction\r\n- Get leader term\r\n- Perform computations\r\n- For every read, just read from the cache\r\n- For every write\r\n  - check if leadership has been lost or term has changed\r\n  - this helps safeguard against cases where we lose leadership during the transaction\r\n  - if yes, rollback transaction\r\n  - if not, remember write action to commit to cache later\r\n- If transaction has succeeded, commit pending writes to cache\r\n- Close transaction\r\n- Release lock\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><h4>Lifecycle of cache</h4></summary>\r\n\r\n- Cache is enabled if `druid.manager.segments.useCache=true` on the Overlord\r\n- When Overlord starts, `start()` cache is called putting it in STANDBY mode.\r\n- In STANDBY mode, the cache polls the metadata store at a period of `druid.manager.segments.pollDuration` to do the following:\r\n   - Retrieve all segment IDs and their last updated timestamps\r\n   - If the cache has stale or no information for any unused segment, update it\r\n   - If the cache has stale or no information for any used segment, fetch entire segment payload\r\n   - Retrieve all pending segments and update cache if it has stale information\r\n- Cache cannot be used for transactions while it is in STANDBY mode.\r\n- When Overlord becomes leader, cache moves to SYNC_PENDING mode.\r\n- When the next poll starts, it moves the cache from SYNC_PENDING to SYNC_STARTED\r\n- When this poll completes, cache is marked as READY\r\n- In READY mode, cache can be used for read and write transactions\r\n- When Overlord loses leadership, cache is moved back to STANDBY mode\r\n- When Overlord stops, `stop()` cache is called stopping the poll\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><h4>Contents of cache</h4></summary>\r\n\r\nThe cache maintains the following fields for every datasource.\r\n\r\n| Field | Needed In |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n|`Map<String, DataSegmentPlus> idToUsedSegment`|Reads/writes for used segments|\r\n|`Set<String> unusedSegmentIds`|Checking set of existing segment IDs to avoid duplicate insert|\r\n|`Map<Interval, Map<String, Integer>> intervalVersionToHighestUnusedPartitionNumber`|Segment allocation to avoid duplicate IDs|\r\n|`Map<Interval, Map<String, PendingSegmentRecord>> intervalToPendingSegments`|Segment allocation|\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><h3> Code changes</h3></summary>\r\n\r\n|Class / Description|\r\n|-----------|\r\n|__`SegmentsMetadataManagerConfig.useCache`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Enable/disable cache on the Overlord</li></ul>|\r\n|__`DatasourceSegmentMetadataReader`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Interface to perform segment metadata read operations</li></ul>|\r\n|__`DatasourceSegmentMetadataWriter`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Interface to perform segment metadata write operations</li></ul>|\r\n|__`HeapMemorySegmentMetadataCache`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Poll committed and pending segments from the metadata store</li></ul>|\r\n|__`DatasourceSegmentCache`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Cache committed and pending segments of a single datasource</li></ul>|\r\n|__`SegmentMetadataTransaction`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Encapsulate all read/write operations performed within a transaction.</li><li>This abstraction allows the code to redirect all read/write operations within a transaction to either the cache or to the metadata store itself</li></ul>|\r\n|__`SqlSegmentMetadataTransaction`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Perform read/writes directly on metadata store if cache is disabled or not ready</li></ul>|\r\n|__`CachedSegmentMetadataTransaction`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Perform read only from cache and writes to both metadata store and cache</li></ul>|\r\n|__`SqlSegmentMetadataTransactionFactory`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Create transaction based on state of cache</li></ul>|\r\n|__`IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator`__|\r\n|<ul><li>Perform all metadata transactions using transaction factory</li><li>Move metadata reads methods to `SqlSegmentsMetadataQuery`</li><li>Move metadata write methods to `SqlSegmentMetadataTransaction`</li>|\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Run [all ITs successfully](https://github.com/apache/druid/actions/runs/13044619489/) with cache enabled in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17653/commits/12dc6f272aced857bdbc7c384c6f2fb1324349b0)\r\n- Update existing tests to run both with and without cache\r\n  - `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinatorTest` \r\n  - `SegmentAllocateActionTest`\r\n  - `SegmentAllocationQueueTest`\r\n- Add `DatasourceSegmentCacheTest`\r\n\r\n### Pending items\r\n\r\n- Cluster testing\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nAdd Overlord runtime property `druid.manager.segments.useCache` (default value `false`).\r\nSet this to `true` to turn on segment metadata caching on the Overlord. This allows segment metadata operations\r\nsuch as reads and segment allocation to be sped up significantly.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade notes\r\n\r\nThe flag `druid.manager.segments.useCache` to enable the segment cache should be turned on only when\r\nDruid has been upgraded to a version containing both this patch #17653 and #17545 .\r\nWhen Druid is being downgraded to an older, the feature flag must first be turned off.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This limits the allocated buffer for storing query results to whatever is set in `CacheConfig.getResultLevelCacheLimit()`. Although we do a check comparing buffer size to `CacheConfig.getResultLevelCacheLimit()` [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/query/ResultLevelCachingQueryRunner.java#L295), this comes after the exception is thrown and is too late to gracefully catch the issue.\r\n\r\n##  **Important Note**\r\nI opted to use `LimitedOutputStream` here as it is already used with `ByteArrayOutputStream`. While ok in QueryRunners (single-threaded), this still is less-than-ideal in the general case because it doesn't guarantee strict consistency between overflow exception delivery and ordering of writes to the buffer(see another example below). As such, this class in general is \\*not\\* thread-safe and I think should be refactored to account for this. This is because every case of `LimitedOutputStream` already uses `ByteArrayOutputStream`, which \\*is\\* already using locks, we should suffer no performance hit by synchronizing `LimitedOutputStream::write` methods. This is just in the general spirit of future-proofing code, given that we're already using locks, we might as well avoid as many future races as we can : ). Given that this would take some changes to the `LimitedOutputStream` API (from extending `ByteArrayOutputStream` directly) I've opted to not change these APIs here, but in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\n Update docs to reflect removal of legacy config options in #17609. Also made the services fail if any of these configs are set to the removed modes, with the help of a new `PropertiesValidator` that is baked into `StartupInjectorBuilder`, allowing for a centralized place to handle checking stuff about runtime.properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf set, service will do a log message that points to the migration guide and then exit:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE: druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull set to 'true', but has been removed, see https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/release-info/migr-ansi-sql-null for details for how to migrate to SQL compliant behavior\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.guice.StartupInjectorBuilder$PropertiesValidator.validate(StartupInjectorBuilder.java:138)\r\n\tat

1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this new validator only checks the 3 properties relevant to this PR to fail fast, but I can also imagine using this to track usage of deprecated properties and doing something like log.alert or something similar to both log and emit metrics to help monitor usage of deprecated properties slated for future removal.","created_at":"2025-01-16T11:23:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T01:15:24Z","closed_at":"2025-01-17T01:15:20Z","merged_at":"2025-01-17T01:15:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e805c9a1063bd9108ca820dd31e62f2a672a648a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

PR makes several improvements to the (experimental) Explore view. Here are the highlights.\r\n\r\n### Better time chart visualization\r\n\r\n![time-chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df1dfd30-9e82-4a56-b775-454d7e2002cf)\r\n\r\nThe time chart visualization has been reworked using code and components from the segment timeline visualization (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17508).\r\n\r\nThe time chart now supports zooming, dragging, and is smarter about granularity detection. It is also no longer using ECharts.\r\n\r\n### Helper tables on the right for quick filtering\r\n\r\n![helper tables](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7090b7be-c268-4c02-ba23-d3c227a8ebb4)\r\n\r\nAdded helper tables that allow for quick filtering and some additional context\r\n\r\n### Added layouts that allow visualization tiles to be shown side by side\r\n\r\n![localhost_18081_unified-console html(Docs) (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd62c1da-b8fd-4083-8feb-85f1310bd6e2)\r\n\r\nVisualizations can now be shown side by side in this simple layout configuration.\r\n\r\n### Also...\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug where non latin1 chars could not be saved in the URL\r\n- Updated some dependencies\r\n- Made the resource picker resizable\r\n- Added tooltip to show and copy last run

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nRemoves the ability to write JSON columns in the older version '4' format, leaving only the latest current version, '5', as the only option. (Internally it isn't really v5, rather v0 of the 'auto' format, but it is branded as v5 for the sake of continuity).\r\n\r\nI have left the structures to control which version is written added in #14955, in the event we need to introduce any newer versions in the future, we just only allow v5 right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nJSON columns can no longer be written in the older V4 format. The current latest version, V5, which has been the default since 28.0.0 is now the only version which can be written to new segments. This means both the `formatVersion` of a JSON column spec on JSON based ingestion specs, e.g. \r\n\r\n```\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"json\",\r\n            \"name\": \"someColumn\",\r\n            \"formatVersion\": 5\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `druid.indexing.formats.nestedColumnFormatVersion` in runtime.properties only allow 5. \r\n\r\nAll older version of JSON columns can still be read and queried just fine, this change just prevents writing new segments in the older format.\r\n\r\nV5 was introduced in Druid 26.0.0, so anyone upgrading from Druid 25.0.0 or older and using JSON columns may wish to first upgrade to any version between 26.0.0 and 32.0.0, which can be configured to keep writing V4 columns until operators are sure there is no need to roll back an upgrade to the older version.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-14T21:19:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T22:46:40Z","closed_at":"2025-01-28T22:41:50Z","merged_at":"2025-01-28T22:41:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"67007e7f86d19a25260ee1ddff5dc8129d43610a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\nThe `druid-ranger-security` extension doesn't seem to be actively maintained, and is very large, so this PR moves it from a 'core' extension to a 'contrib' extension. \r\n\r\nThis extension has quite a large size, so removing it also shrinks the binary distribution quite a bit.\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 clint  staff   652M Jan 14 12:21 apache-druid-32.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 clint  staff   571M Jan 14 12:07 apache-druid-32.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf any committer wants to actively maintain this extension, I think it should be modified to use the ranger client https://github.com/apache/ranger/tree/master/intg/src/main/java instead of how it currently works, which I think would shrink the footprint in the binary distribution quite a lot.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n`druid-ranger-security` has been moved from a 'core' extension to a 'contrib' extension to better reflect how actively it is maintained. This means it is no longer bundled with the binary distribution by default, but is still available to download the same as any other community extension.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-14T20:37:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:50:22Z","closed_at":"2025-01-17T03:48:09Z","merged_at":"2025-01-17T03:48:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"0c8e8e07a52b63409d556d8be30ece15c4b3f01f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

kubernetes-overlord-extensions a core extension.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI think it makes sense to make this extension (k8s based ingestion) a core extension.\r\n- It has significant unit test coverage and I am aware of at least a few users using it in production.\r\n- It also has features like a migration path to/from mm ingestion.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nMake k8s ingestion a core extension\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * move kubernetes-overlord-extensions from extensions-contrib -> extensions-core\r\n\r\nIt looks like this made the standard build around 15MB bigger which seems okay to me (681->696MB).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

can achieve more parallelism by leveraging more GitHub runners, and splitting the tests across them.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the unit tests for each of the above 3 modules based on the first character of the test class name into 2 groups:\r\n- First group: Test classes starting with A-K\r\n- Second group: Test classes starting with L-Z\r\n\r\nThe results can be seen with the test runs taking half the duration compared to before.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry

a issue where the KubernetesTaskRunner still tracks task status after the overlord it is running on has lost leadership.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe KubernetesTaskRunner doesn't actually do anything to stop watching running tasks in its stop method(), so the threads watching each task continue running doTask(). In this situation, the task queue is already shutdown, so the only thing that happens is the 'phantom' KubernetesTaskRunner sending notifications to its task queue that get ignored and potentially task logs getting double uploaded.\r\n\r\nThis is still not ideal, so we should shutdown the exec Executor in the stop method. This won't stop any of the tasks (they're running on k8s), but will stop the overlord's management of these tasks, which is the correct behavior.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nFixed a bug with overlord shutdown in mmless mode.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nBugfix with mmless ingestion.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesTaskRunner`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
