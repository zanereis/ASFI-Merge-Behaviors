If we isolate test suite the problem should be gone.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCI builds for \"spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-3.2\" are failing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any

back https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25955\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new rule, `V2ScanRelationPushDown`, to push filters and projections in to a new `DataSourceV2ScanRelation` in the optimizer. That scan is then used when converting to a physical scan node. The new relation correctly reports stats based on the scan.\r\n\r\nTo run scan pushdown before rules where stats are used, this adds a new optimizer override, `earlyScanPushDownRules` and a batch for early pushdown in the optimizer, before cost-based join reordering. The other early pushdown rule, `PruneFileSourcePartitions`, is moved into the early pushdown rule set.\r\n\r\nThis also moves pushdown helper methods from `DataSourceV2Strategy` into a util class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is needed for DSv2 sources to supply stats for cost-based rules in the optimizer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis updates the implementation of stats from `DataSourceV2Relation` so tests will fail if stats are accessed before early pushdown for v2

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs comment https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26221#issuecomment-545954335\r\nRaise a pr with entire code and pass origin `hive-thriftserver` 's UT\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Impelemnt `Type` in scala since spark con't support all type of hive\r\n2. Implement `Service/AbstractService` prepare for remove hive conf in future\r\n3. Construct RowSet with StructType and Row\r\n4. Implement `HiveAuthFactory` since between 1.2.1/2.3.5, their delegation token managerment changed. Impelment on DelegationTokenMnagerment by scala\r\n5. MV `tableTypeString` from `SparkMetadataOperationUtils` to `SparkMetadataOperation`\r\n5. Since there are `tableTypeString` in `SparkMetadataOperation` remove `ClassicTypeMapping`, `HiveTableTypeMapping`, `TableTypeMapping` and `TableTypeMappingFactory`\r\n6. Implement all oepration for spark since it execute in different way\r\n7. Add new method `GetQueryId`, `SetClientInfo` for thrift version v11 in `ThriftCLIService`\r\n8. Add `statementid` to `Operation` for implement `GetQueryId`\r\n9. Remove `GlobalHivercFileProcessor` `setFetchSize` `processGlobalInitFile`etc\r\n10. Remove unused `openSession` `openSessionWithImpersonation` in `CLIService`\r\n11. Copy `hive-thriftserver` test to `spark-thriftserver` and remove `ThriftSeverShimUtils` about test UT, since we won't need it.\r\n12. Implement it's own thrift client code. `CLIServiceClient` `ThrictCLIServiceClient`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSolve hive version conflics and finally build a thriftserver make hive plugability. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nstart and stop\r\n```\r\n./sbin/start-spark-thriftserver.sh\r\n./sbin/stop-spark-thriftserver.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nuse

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor dynamic partition overwrite, its working dir is `.spark-staging-{jobId}`.\r\nTask file name formatted `part-$taskId-$jobId$ext`(regardless task attempt Id).\r\nEach task writes its output to:\r\n\r\n- `.spark-staging-{jobId}/partitionPath1/taskFileName1`\r\n- `.spark-staging-{jobId}/partitionPath2/taskFileName2`\r\n- ...\r\n- `.spark-staging-{jobId}/partitionPathN/taskFileNameN`\r\n\r\nIf speculation is enabled, there may be several tasks, which have same taskId and different attemptId, write to the same files concurrently.\r\nFor distributedFileSystem, it only allow one task to hold the lease to write a file, if two tasks want to write the same file, an exception like `no lease on inode` would be thrown.\r\n\r\nEven speculation is not enabled, if a task aborted due to Executor OOM, its output would not be cleaned up.\r\nThen a new task launched to write the same file, because parquet disallows overwriting, a `FileAlreadyExistsException` would be thrown, like.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileAlreadyExistsException: /user/hive/warehouse/t2/.spark-staging-1f1efbfd-7e20-4e0f-a49c-a7fa3eae4cb1/part1=2/part2=2/part-00000-1f1efbfd-7e20-4e0f-a49c-a7fa3eae4cb1.c000.snappy.parquet for client 127.0.0.1 already

org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolPB.ClientNamenodeProtocolServerSideTranslatorPB.create(ClientNamenodeProtocolServerSideTranslatorPB.java:398)\r\n```\r\nIt is a critical issue and would cause job failed.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we fix this issue with the solution below:\r\n1. set a working path under staging dir named partitionPath-attemptId.\r\n2. after task completed, rename partitionPath-attemptId/fileName to partitionPath/fileName\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, dynamic partition overwrite operation might fail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-31T08:14:09Z","updated_at":"2020-07-03T03:20:49Z","closed_at":"2020-07-03T02:58:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75c29326bbf139b4b78cc38eab99a545f5202fa6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch removes v1 ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN syntax.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince in v2 we have ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN and ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN, this old syntax is not necessary now and can be confusing.\r\n\r\nThe v2 ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN should fallback to v1 AlterTableChangeColumnCommand (#26354).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the old v1 ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN syntax is removed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith this change, executor's bindAddress is passed as an input parameter for RPCEnv.create.\r\nA previous PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21261 which addressed the same, was using a Spark Conf property to get the bindAddress which wouldn't have worked for multiple executors.\r\nThis PR is to enable anyone overriding CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend with their custom one to be able to invoke CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.main() along with the option to configure bindAddress.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is required when Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)'s are used inside Linux container where the hostname is not the same as container hostname.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested by running jobs with executors on KVMs inside a linux

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to refactor code related to the `IntervalUtils.fromDayTimeString()` method by:\r\n- making it more generic and independent from the requested range of interval units\r\n- introducing enumeration for unit names. This should allow to avoid typos in unit names.\r\n- extracting unit value properties from `fromDayTimeString()` like min/max values and a function for converting parsed values to microseconds using exact math methods.\r\n\r\n**This PR includes code from** https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26313\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To improve maintainability of `fromDayTimeString()` and related code in `IntervalUtils`\r\n- Avoid adhoc code\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test in `IntervalUtilsSuite` and `DDLParserSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-30T19:32:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:40:52Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T17:09:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9359dead0313fa60fe5af77e4172c15fc9252884","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/140a26fbe9836908bd3094d15a9f4dc234346fc8","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:refactor-from-daytime-string","ref":"refactor-from-daytime-string","sha":"140a26fbe9836908bd3094d15a9f4dc234346fc8","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to deprecate `Python 3.4 ~ 3.5`, which is prior to version 3.6 additionally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince `Python 3.8` is already out, we will focus on to support Python 3.6/3.7/3.8.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. It's highly recommended to use Python 3.6/3.7. We will verify Python 3.8 before Apache Spark 3.0.0 release.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNA (This is a doc-only

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe Spark metrics system produces many different metrics and not all of them are used at the same time. This proposes to introduce a configuration parameter to allow disabling the registration of metrics in the \"static sources\" category.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis allows to reduce the load and clutter on the sink, in the cases when the metrics in question are not needed. The metrics registerd as \"static sources\" are under the namespaces CodeGenerator and HiveExternalCatalog and can produce a significant amount of data, as they are registered for the driver and executors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIt introduces a new configuration parameter `spark.metrics.register.static.sources.enabled`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr is to fix a bug discovered by me, [SPARK-29594], when creating a Dataset using .toDS() in a sequence of a case class that had a field name starting with a number.\r\nThe exception was improved, now explains why it breaks, and gives a work around of the problem.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n~~Tests were added, sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DatasetSuite.scala~~\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nThe tests could not be added because the documentation generation is in Java and doesn't allow to create a class

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nremove the `table` from `AlterTable/DescribeTable.children`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor DDL/DML commands, we only want to get the v2 table from `DataSourceV2Relation`. Things can go wrong if other rules transform the query plan and mistakenly convert `DataSourceV2Relation` in DDL/DML commands to something else.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26091 , we should exclude the `table` from `AlterTable/DescribeTable.children`, so that they can't be transformed unintentionally. This is also what we did for the writing plans (AppendData for example).\r\n\r\nThe code is mostly extracted from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25955 , to ease the review of that PR. All credits go to @rdblue \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue that external listeners are not initialized properly when `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` is set to either \"maven\" or custom list of jar.\r\n(\"builtin\" is not a case here - all jars in Spark classloader are also available in separate classloader)\r\n\r\nThe culprit is lazy initialization (lazy val or passing builder function) & thread context classloader. HiveClient leverages IsolatedClientLoader to properly load Hive and relevant libraries without issue - to not mess up with Spark classpath it uses separate classloader with leveraging thread context classloader.\r\n\r\nBut there's a messed-up case - SessionState is being initialized while HiveClient changed the thread context classloader from Spark classloader to Hive isolated one, and streaming query listeners are loaded from changed classloader while initializing SessionState.\r\n\r\nThis patch forces initializing SessionState in SparkSQLEnv to avoid such case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nClassNotFoundException could occur in spark-sql with specific configuration, as explained above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as I don't think end users assume the classloader of external listeners is only containing jars for Hive client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT added which fails on master branch and passes with the patch.\r\n\r\nThe error message with master branch when running UT:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error while instantiating

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extract parsing of the seconds interval units to the private method `parseNanos` in `IntervalUtils` and modify the code to correctly parse the fractional part of the seconds unit of intervals in the cases:\r\n- When the fractional part has less than 9 digits\r\n- The seconds unit is negative\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed to fix the issues:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval '10.123456 seconds';\r\ninterval 10 seconds 123 microseconds\r\n```\r\nThe correct result must be `interval 10 seconds 123 milliseconds 456 microseconds`\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval '-10.123456789 seconds';\r\ninterval -9 seconds -876 milliseconds -544 microseconds\r\n```\r\nbut the whole interval should be negated, and the result must be `interval -10 seconds -123 milliseconds -456 microseconds`, taking into account the truncation to microseconds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval '10.123456 seconds';\r\ninterval 10 seconds 123 milliseconds 456 microseconds\r\nspark-sql> select interval '-10.123456789 seconds';\r\ninterval -10 seconds -123 milliseconds -456 microseconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing and new tests in `ExpressionParserSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-30T08:00:12Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:40:51Z","closed_at":"2019-10-31T01:21:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4762e2b81dbe5fc3538b5d4a934b85ad81dd28bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/337e9af2fb6fa20c5245419c19dda807554d0e6c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-interval-nanos-parsing","ref":"fix-interval-nanos-parsing","sha":"337e9af2fb6fa20c5245419c19dda807554d0e6c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe already know task attempts that do not clean up output files in staging directory can cause job failure (SPARK-27194). There was proposals trying to fix it by changing output filename, or deleting existing output files. These proposals are not reliable completely.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is, as previous failed task attempt wrote the output file, at next task attempt the output file is still under same staging directory, even the output file name is different.\r\n\r\nIf the job will go to fail eventually, there is no point to re-run the task until max attempts are reached. For the jobs running a lot of time, re-running the task can waste a lot of time.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to let Spark detect such file already exist exception and stop the task set early.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor now, if FileAlreadyExistsException is thrown during data writing job in SQL, the job will continue re-running task attempts until max failure number is reached. It is no point for re-running tasks as task attempts will also fail because they can not write to the existing file too. We should stop the task set early.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. If FileAlreadyExistsException is thrown during data writing job in SQL, no more task attempts are re-tried and the task set will be stoped early.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdate `AlterTableSetLocationStatement` to store `partitionSpec` and make `ALTER TABLE a.b.c PARTITION(...)

If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nALTER TABLE t PARTITION(...)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCorrected ShortType and ByteType mapping to SmallInt and TinyInt, corrected setter methods to set ShortType and ByteType  as setShort() and setByte(). Changes in JDBCUtils.scala\r\nFixed Unit test cases to where applicable and added new E2E test cases in to test table read/write using ShortType and ByteType.\r\n\r\n#### Problems\r\n\r\n- In master in JDBCUtils.scala line number 547 and 551 have a problem where ShortType and ByteType are set as Integers rather than set as Short and Byte respectively.\r\n```\r\ncase ShortType =>\r\n(stmt: PreparedStatement, row: Row, pos: Int) =>\r\nstmt.setInt(pos + 1, row.getShort(pos))\r\nThe issue was pointed out by @maropu \r\n\r\ncase ByteType =>\r\n(stmt: PreparedStatement, row: Row, pos: Int) =>\r\n stmt.setInt(pos + 1, row.getByte(pos))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Also at line JDBCUtils.scala 247 TinyInt is interpreted wrongly as IntergetType in getCatalystType()\r\n\r\n``` case java.sql.Types.TINYINT       => IntegerType ```\r\n\r\n- At line 172 ShortType was wrongly interpreted as IntegerType\r\n``` case ShortType => Option(JdbcType(\"INTEGER\", java.sql.Types.SMALLINT)) ``` \r\n\r\n- All thru out tests, ShortType and ByteType were being interpreted as IntegerTypes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA given type should be set using the right type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCorrected Unit test cases where applicable. Validated in CI/CD\r\nAdded a test case in MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite.scala, PostgresIntegrationSuite.scala , MySQLIntegrationSuite.scala to write/read tables from dataframe with cols as shorttype and bytetype. Validated by manual as follows.\r\n```\r\n./build/mvn install -DskipTests\r\n./build/mvn test -Pdocker-integration-tests -pl :spark-docker-integration-tests_2.12\r\n```\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-30T02:05:43Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T23:59:22Z","closed_at":"2019-11-14T01:56:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3463188efe267be974dae63d6393b909fc4b23f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26301/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26301/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26301/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06008946964cc7acb8df3ff781513e4577dd2116","head":{"label":"shivsood:shorttype_fix_maropu","ref":"shorttype_fix_maropu","sha":"06008946964cc7acb8df3ff781513e4577dd2116","user":{"login":"shivsood","id":1579057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzkwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1579057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood","html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192983938,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI5ODM5Mzg=","name":"spark","full_name":"shivsood/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shivsood","id":1579057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzkwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1579057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood","html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bug that `ContinuousMemoryStream[String]` throws error regarding ClassCastException - cast String to UTFString. This is because ContinuousMemoryStream and ContinuousRecordEndpoint uses origin input as it is for underlying data structure of Row, and encoding is missing here.\r\n\r\nTo force encoding, this patch changes the element type of underlying array to UnsafeRow instead of Any for ContinuousRecordEndpoint - ContinuousMemoryStream and TextSocketContinuousStream are modified to reflect the change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAbove section describes the bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new UT to check for availability on couple of types.","created_at":"2019-10-29T22:23:14Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T20:17:33Z","closed_at":"2019-11-06T18:37:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d862ae0fa2e04ba17fe9ddc031eebcc48d2d2a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nInstead of having several overloads of `getTable` method in `TableProvider`, it's better to have 2 methods explicitly: `inferSchema` and `inferPartitioning`. With a single `getTable` method that takes everything: schema, partitioning and properties.\r\n\r\nSpark supports: 1) infer both schema and partitioning. 2) specifies schema and infer partitioning 3) specifies both schema and partitioning. So `inferPartitioning` method takes `schema` as input, as schema must be known before inferring partitioning.\r\n\r\nA lot of changes are made to file source v2, to move the schema inference from `FileTable` to `FileDataSourceV2`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is inspired by the discussion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25651#discussion_r328340643\r\n\r\nIt's better to let the APIs have explicit meanings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark org.apache.spark.sql.functions do not have `if` function so conditions are expressed using `when-otherwise` function. However `If` (which is available in SQL) has more efficient code gen. This pr rewrites `when-otherwise` conditions to `If` if it is possible (`when-otherwise` with single branch)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is an optimization enhancement. Here is a simple performance comparison (tested in local mode (with 4 cores)):\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(10000000000L).withColumn(\"x\", rand)\r\nval resultA = df.withColumn(\"r\", when($\"x\" <

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to allow `array_contains` to take column instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor consistent support in Scala and Python APIs. Scala allows column instances at `array_contains`\r\n\r\nScala:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nval df = Seq(Array(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), Array.empty[String]).toDF(\"data\")\r\ndf.select(array_contains($\"data\", lit(\"a\"))).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import array_contains, lit\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"],), ([],)], ['data'])\r\ndf.select(array_contains(df.data, lit(\"a\"))).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, PySpark sides does not allow.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import array_contains, lit\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"],), ([],)], ['data'])\r\ndf.select(array_contains(df.data, lit(\"a\"))).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere're some issues observed in `HiveUserDefinedTypeSuite.\"Support UDT in Hive UDF\"`: \r\n\r\n1) Neither function (TestUDF) nor test take \"nullable\" point column into account.\r\n2) ExamplePointUDT. sqlType is ArrayType which doesn't provide information how many elements are expected. RandomDataGenerator may provide less elements than needed.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes `HiveUserDefinedTypeSuite.\"Support UDT in Hive UDF\"` to change the type of \"point\" column to be non-nullable, as well as not use RandomDataGenerator to create row for UDT backed by ArrayType. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCI builds are failing in high occurrences.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nre-arrange the parser rules to make it clear that multiple unit TO unit statement like `SELECT INTERVAL '1-1' YEAR TO MONTH '2-2' YEAR TO MONTH` is not allowed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is definitely an accident that we support such a weird syntax in the past. It's not supported by any other DBs and I can't think of any use case of it. Also no test covers this syntax in the current codebase.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, and a migration guide item is added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is adding the base classes needed for Stage level scheduling. Its adding a ResourceProfile and the executor and task resource request classes.  These are made private for now until we get all the parts implemented, at which point this will become public interfaces.  I am adding them first as all the other subtasks for this feature require these classes.  If people have better ideas on breaking this feature up please let me know.\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29415 for more detailed design.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew API for stage level scheduling.  Its easier to add these first because the other jira for this features will all use them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes adds API to create a ResourceProfile with executor/task resources, see the spip jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27495\r\n\r\nExample of the api:\r\nval rp = new ResourceProfile()\r\nrp.require(new ExecutorResourceRequest(\"cores\", 2))\r\nrp.require(new ExecutorResourceRequest(\"gpu\", 1, Some(\"/opt/gpuScripts/getGpus\")))\r\nrp.require(new TaskResourceRequest(\"gpu\", 1))\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested using Unit tests added with this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-28T15:36:45Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T15:37:47Z","closed_at":"2019-11-25T15:37:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6176ce627afc901240f2ba9ae8862e09a53e6682","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen parsing a string to interval, do not allow the leading \"interval\".\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the leading \"interval\" from `CalendarInterval.toString`, to be consistent. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen parsing string to interval, we already know it's an interval and the leading \"interval\" in the string is kind of duplicated. The behavior is also consistent with pgsql\r\n```\r\ncloud0fan=# select 'interval 1 day'::interval;\r\nERROR:  invalid input syntax for type interval: \"interval 1 day\"\r\nLINE 1: select 'interval 1 day'::interval;\r\n               ^\r\ncloud0fan=# select '1 day'::interval;\r\n interval \r\n----------\r\n 1 day\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\ncloud0fan=# select interval'interval 1 year';\r\nERROR:  invalid input syntax for type interval: \" interval 1 year\"\r\nLINE 1: select interval' interval 1 year';\r\n\r\ncloud0fan=# select interval'1 year';\r\n interval \r\n----------\r\n 1 year\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The `INTERVAL'...'` syntax is newly introduced in the master branch, so it's OK to change. The cast behavior in 2.4 is pretty weird: the leading \"interval\" in the string is required. I think it's better to change it (with a migration guide and legacy config).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is related to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26510 and add retry mechanism to start process.\r\nWe have a lot job with PySpark. We only find a small number of job causes the issue. After some try will reduce the issue.\r\nI think the root cause of the exit is the robust problem with the user code.\r\nIf when starting Python process, but exited caused by a unstable factor of system, do we need to make the effort to retry?\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn order to clarify the exception and try three times default.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBuild the `BatchWrite` in the planner and get rid of the `V1_BATCH_WRITE` table capability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's always better to make the API simpler and easier to implement. When I was working on v1 read fallback API at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26231 , I realized that we don't need a table capability for it, because we create the `Scan` object in the planner. We can do the same thing for v1 write fallback API as well.\r\n\r\nThis can also reduce duplicated code of creating the `WriteBuilder`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, I proposed to escape strings when serializing Map/Array/Struct type in Spark ThriftServer, so that the result is always a valid JSON, which is what Hive does. \r\nAdd a conf to make sure it doesn't break compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe string serialized from Map/Array/Struct type in Spark ThriftServer is not a valid JSON when  the elements of Map/Array/Struct contain special characters such as `\"`. \r\n\r\nFor example, select a field whose type is map<string, string>, the spark thrift server returns\r\nBEFORE\r\n```{\"author_id\":\"123\",\"log_pb\":\"{\"impr_id\":\"20181231\"}\",\"request_id\":\"001\"}```\r\n\r\nAFTER\r\n```{\"author_id\":\"123\",

tested?\r\nHiveResultSuite.scala

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd AlterTableRecoverPartitionsStatement and make ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nALTER TABLE t RECOVER PARTITIONS  // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. When running ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-27T00:06:06Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T15:46:04Z","closed_at":"2019-10-29T05:54:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"684cd4095893b025c2ef0ccc3a70e6c8518e79ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26269/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26269/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26269/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aaa6bfd03e65e40858e8ec552c2198b0ede898b1","head":{"label":"huaxingao:spark-29612","ref":"spark-29612","sha":"aaa6bfd03e65e40858e8ec552c2198b0ede898b1","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to move all static methods from the `CalendarInterval` class to the `IntervalUtils` object. All those methods are rewritten from Java to Scala.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- For consistency with other helper methods. Such methods were placed to the helper object `IntervalUtils`, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26190\r\n- Taking into account that `CalendarInterval` will be fully exposed to users in the future (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25022), it would be nice to clean it up by moving service methods to an internal object.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By moved tests from `CalendarIntervalSuite` to `IntervalUtilsSuite`\r\n- By existing test suites\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-25T20:08:49Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:40:49Z","closed_at":"2019-10-29T17:15:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56c2e29b67ce0d6cd1645d54fd37b0a9d864beee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38f7c78e51ed4a19a24aee6aca08fc58dd101f20","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:refactoring-calendar-interval","ref":"refactoring-calendar-interval","sha":"38f7c78e51ed4a19a24aee6aca08fc58dd101f20","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue that external listeners are not initialized properly when `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` is set to either \"maven\" or custom list of jar.\r\n(\"builtin\" is not a case here - all jars in Spark classloader are also available in separate classloader) \r\n\r\nThe culprit is lazy initialization (lazy val or passing builder function) & thread context classloader. HiveClient leverages IsolatedClientLoader to properly load Hive and relevant libraries without issue - to not mess up with Spark classpath it uses separate classloader with leveraging thread context classloader.\r\n\r\nBut there's a messed-up case - SessionState is being initialized while HiveClient changed the thread context classloader from Spark classloader to Hive isolated one, and streaming query listeners are loaded from changed classloader while initializing SessionState.\r\n\r\nThis patch forces initializing SessionState in SparkSQLEnv to avoid such case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nClassNotFoundException could occur in spark-sql with specific configuration, as explained above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as I don't think end users assume the classloader of external listeners is only containing jars for Hive client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT added which fails on master branch and passes with the patch.\r\n\r\nThe error message with master branch when running UT:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error while instantiating 'org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveSessionStateBuilder':;\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error while instantiating

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new function `stringToInterval()` in `IntervalUtils` for converting `UTF8String` to `CalendarInterval`. The function is used in casting a `STRING` column to an `INTERVAL` column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe proposed implementation is ~10 times faster. For example, parsing 9 interval units on JDK 8:\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n9 units w/ interval                               14004          14125         116          0.1       14003.6       0.0X\r\n9 units w/o interval                              13785          14056         290          0.1       13784.9       0.0X\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n9 units w/ interval                                1343           1344           1          0.7        1343.0       0.3X\r\n9 units w/o interval                               1345           1349           8          0.7        1344.6       0.3X\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By new tests for `stringToInterval` in `IntervalUtilsSuite`\r\n- By existing

It is not in branch-2.4 or others. I'm saying it's fine to open a PR for 2.4 too, as it needs a very slightly different change, and then it could be part of 2.4. Yes, you need a new PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.kafka010.KafkaDelegationTokenSuite` failed lately.
