This PR is to add code-gen support for FULL OUTER shuffled hash join. \r\n\r\nThe main change is in `ShuffledHashJoinExec.scala:doProduce()` to generate code for FULL OUTER join.\r\n* `ShuffledHashJoinExec.scala:codegenFullOuterJoinWithUniqueKey()` is the code for join with unique join key from build side.\r\n* `ShuffledHashJoinExec.scala:codegenFullOuterJoinWithNonUniqueKey()` is the code for join with non-unique key.\r\n\r\nExample query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df1 = spark.range(5).select($\"id\".as(\"k1\"))\r\nval df2 = spark.range(10).select($\"id\".as(\"k2\"))\r\ndf1.join(df2.hint(\"SHUFFLE_HASH\"), $\"k1\" === $\"k2\" % 3 && $\"k1\" + 3 =!= $\"k2\", \"full_outer\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerated code for example query: https://gist.github.com/c21/828b782ee81827f4148939cb50314a7b\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove query performance for FULL OUTER shuffled hash join.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n* Added unit test in `WholeStageCodegenSuite`.\r\n* Existing unit test in

TABLESAMPLE:\r\n\r\n- TABLESAMPLE(x PERCENT)\r\n- TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET x OUT OF y)\r\n\r\n`Dataset.sample` has a param to specify seed, so we should allow SQL has a way to specify seed too.\r\n```\r\n  def sample(fraction: Double, seed: Long): Dataset[T] = {\r\n    sample(withReplacement = false, fraction = fraction, seed = seed)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nMost of the DBMS uses REPEATABLE to let user specify

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a new trait `ExpressionBuilder` to help register functions with complex overloads that are hard to implement in the class constructor. And use this new API to register `lpad` and `rpad` functions, to fix the breaking change and allow these two functions to have mixed string and binary inputs under non-ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34407 , we realized that the lpad and rpad functions are convoluted because:\r\n1. We want to return binary if the `str` and `pad` are both binary.\r\n2. We want to return string if the `str` and `pad` are both string.\r\n3. If one parameter is string and the other is binary, we want to return string to not break existing queries. But with ansi mode, we want to fail as this case is likely a user mistake.\r\n\r\nIt's very hard to implement this logic with constructor, and #34407 chooses to let the function support mixed input types at runtime instead of compile time, which is a bit hacky.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisallow casting Date as Numeric types, which always returned NULL in Spark 3.2 or earlier.\r\nIf users really want to fall back to the legacy behavior, they can set the legacy flag `spark.sql.legacy.allowCastDateAsNumeric` as true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, Date type values can be cast as Numeric types. However, the result is always NULL.\r\nOn the other hand, Numeric values can't be cast as Date type.\r\nIt doesn't make sense to keep the behavior of casting Date to NULL numeric types. I suggest to disallow the conversion. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Disallow casting Date as Numeric types. If users really want to fall back to the legacy behavior, they can set the legacy flag `spark.sql.legacy.allowCastDateAsNumeric` as true.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2021-10-29T12:10:10Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T08:33:04Z","closed_at":"2021-10-30T08:33:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c2ecd852b9a88d0c0fc530b3e24bac8acb1d59c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34440/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34440/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ded44e70d6811c9f06c41618499dc58df1067a7c","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:disallowDateToInt","ref":"disallowDateToInt","sha":"ded44e70d6811c9f06c41618499dc58df1067a7c","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds a new config to optionally disable padding for char type, by replacing char type with varchar type in the table schema when creating/updating tables. Existing tables with char type column/field are not affected.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nchar type is a legacy in the SQL world. Its padding behavior was mostly for storage optimization at that time, which is not a useful SQL semantic. As result,  [MySQL trims the spaces for char type by default](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-8.0-en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_pad_char_to_full_length), [Snowflake simply treats char as an alias of varchar](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-text.html#char-character).\r\n\r\nIt makes sense for Spark to also demote char type by adding this config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove partition filtering speed and reduce metastore pressure.\r\nWe can first pull all the partition names, filter by expressions, and then obtain detailed information about the corresponding partitions from the MetaStore Server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen `convertFilters` cannot take effect, cannot filter the queried partitions in advance on the hive MetaStore Server. At this time, `getAllPartitionsOf` will get all partition details.\r\n\r\nWhen the Hive client cannot use the server filter, it will first obtain the values of all partitions, and then filter.\r\n\r\nWhen we have a table with a lot of partitions and there is no way to filter it on the MetaStore Server, we will get all the partition details and filter it on the client side. This is slow and puts a lot of pressure on the MetaStore Server.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYES\r\n`spark.sql.hive.metastorePartitionPruningFastFallback`\r\nWhen this config is enabled, if the predicates are not supported by Hive or Spark does fallback due to encountering `MetaException` from the metastore, Spark will instead prune partitions by getting the partition names first and then evaluating the filter expressions on the client side.\r\nNote that the predicates with `TimeZoneAwareExpression` is not supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport SparkSQL use IN/EXISTS with subquery in Project/Aggregate\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, user runs the following code will report an error.\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE tbl1 (col1 INT, col2 STRING) USING PARQUET;\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tbl1 SELECT 0,1;\r\nCREATE TABLE tbl2 (c1 INT, c2 STRING) USING PARQUET; \r\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tbl2 SELECT 0,2;\r\n\r\ncase 1:\r\n    select c1 in (select col1 from tbl1) from tbl2 \r\n    Error msg:\r\n        IN/EXISTS predicate sub-queries can only be used in Filter/Join and a few commands: Project []\r\ncase 2:\r\n    select count(1), case when c1 in (select col1 from tbl1) then \"A\" else \"B\" end as tag from tbl2 group by case when c1 in (select col1 from tbl1) then \"A\" else \"B\" end \r\n    Error msg:\r\n        IN/EXISTS predicate sub-queries can only be used in Filter/Join and a few commands: Aggregate []\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to use V2 commands as default as outlined in [SPARK-36588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36588), and this PR migrates `DESCRIBE NAMESPACE` to use v2 command by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands,  and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFor non-session catalogs (v2 command), the followings are changing:\r\n1. `Properties` row will be present with empty value even if there is no property (same behavior as v1).\r\n2. There will be an empty space between each property pair: e.g. `((a,b), (c,d))` (new) vs. `((a,b),(c,d))` (old). This is also the same behavior as v1.\r\n\r\nFor the session catalog, now that v2 command will be used, we will use `Namespace Name` instead of `Database Name` for the name row. The user can fall back to using v1 command by setting `spark.sql.legacy.useV1Command` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2021-10-29T01:38:16Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T05:55:22Z","closed_at":"2021-11-01T05:55:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6ffce744cb4e63a0aa8a6ab6732aeff2ddda600","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34429/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34429/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34429/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8da00228c2c09deebde461c2769afcd29392fd1b","head":{"label":"imback82:v2_desc_namespace","ref":"v2_desc_namespace","sha":"8da00228c2c09deebde461c2769afcd29392fd1b","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

This would not be an issue when the attempt failed with TimeoutException. But if the connection between the worker and the master is broken, the attempt would fail immediately, leading to the retry attempt also fail, and quickly reaches the max attempt limitation.\r\n\r\nThe PR detects the failure reason, if an attempt failed due to bad connection, we can wait for a while (the default RPC timeout interval) before retrying. This prevents quick failure due to transient network issues.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds a new config `spark.worker.executorStateSync.maxAttempts`, which controls the max attempt number of ExecutorStateChanged sync between a worker and the master.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid a worker exit quickly due to transient network issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this PR adds a new config `spark.worker.executorStateSync.maxAttempts`, which controls the max attempt number of ExecutorStateChanged sync between a worker and the master.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nVerified with a few customers, confirmed they didn't hit the worker exit issue again with this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR improves error messages for arithmetic overflow exceptions thrown under ANSI mode. It augments the error messages by suggesting workarounds to users:\r\n- Turn off ANSI mode (except for ANSI interval type)\r\n- Use `try_` function if applicable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make error messages more actionable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Certain error messages will be different.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-10-28T18:13:15Z","updated_at":"2021-10-29T17:59:24Z","closed_at":"2021-10-29T09:01:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1a446fb96858e2d7b96cf973cfdd0e19ea23f52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d16505b5d701dbec67c83ff9b52dcde7814cc745","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-37149-overflow-err-msg","ref":"spark-37149-overflow-err-msg","sha":"d16505b5d701dbec67c83ff9b52dcde7814cc745","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBug Fix.\r\n\r\nThe problematic code is in `MetricsReporter`:\r\n`registerGauge(\"latency\", _.durationMs.get(\"triggerExecution\").longValue(), 0L)`\r\nInstead of `.getOrDefault(...).longValue()` it uses `.get(\"triggerExecution\").longValue()` which can return a null pointer exception if \"triggerExecution\" is not in the durationMs map.\r\n\r\nSolution: use `.getOrDefault` when accessing a map.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen `MetricsReporter.scala` registers a Gauge it occasionally returns a NPE. This breaks reporting custom metrics via Dropwizard and logs multiple times a stacktrace. It usually happens when using StructuredStreaming on a slow data source but I'm not able to reliably reproduce it every time. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes - fixes occasional failures when reporting metrics with Dropwizard\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a unit-test.","created_at":"2021-10-28T16:43:58Z","updated_at":"2021-10-31T00:25:56Z","closed_at":"2021-10-30T22:30:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"172b20596379b6d156f81cea481b8a71cfe71f80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a new config to optionally enforce the ANSI reserved keywords in the parser. The default value is true, so we by default still enforce it and there is no behavior change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark 3.2, the ANSI mode is GA. We want more people to try and use the ANSI mode, to find data issues as early as possible and get better data quality. However, the reserved keywords thing is a big stopper for many users that want to try ANSI mode. They have to update the SQL queries to pass the parser, which is nothing about data quality but just trouble.\r\n\r\nWith a new config to allow users to not enforce reserved keywords, I think we can get better adoption of the ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nupdated tests.","created_at":"2021-10-27T14:59:57Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T04:58:29Z","closed_at":"2021-10-28T04:58:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15b4a8fab2b16a7f0f20d8b0a07a44a6872766fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4269fe8894b8d43339773150884772c5ca3af2e0","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:parser","ref":"parser","sha":"4269fe8894b8d43339773150884772c5ca3af2e0","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Make `AnsiInterval` data type support radix sort in SQL.\r\n- Enhance the `SortSuite` by disable radix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe radix sort is more faster than timsort, the benchmark result can see in `SortBenchmark`.\r\n\r\nSince the `AnsiInterval` data type is comparable:\r\n\r\n- `YearMonthIntervalType` -> int ordering\r\n- `DayTimeIntervalType` -> long ordering\r\n\r\nAnd we aslo support radix sort when the ordering column date type is int or long.\r\n\r\nSo `AnsiInterval` radix sort can be supported.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34335.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe previous bug depends on the pandas version, not the Spark version.\r\n\r\nSo the difference is still alive with pandas < 1.3.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Spark 3.2 with pandas 1.2.\r\n>>> pidx = pd.Index([10, 20, 15, 30, 45, None], name=\"x\")\r\n>>> psidx = ps.Index(pidx)\r\n\r\n>>> pidx\r\nIndex([10, 20, 15, 30, 45, None], dtype='object', name='x')\r\n>>> psidx\r\nFloat64Index([10.0, 20.0, 15.0, 30.0, 45.0, nan], dtype='float64', name='x')\r\n\r\n>>> pidx.astype(str)\r\nIndex(['10', '20', '15', '30', '45', 'None'], dtype='object', name='x')\r\n>>> psidx.astype(str)\r\nIndex(['10.0', '20.0', '15.0', '30.0', '45.0', 'nan'], dtype='object', name='x')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think many people are still using pandas < 1.3, so maybe we'd better to separate the test for old version of pandas for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's test only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis Jira is aim to support Arrow format in RowToColumnarExec.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent ArrowColumnVector is not fully equivalent to OnHeap/OffHeapColumnVector in spark, so RowToColumnarExec doesn't support write to Arrow format so far.\r\n\r\nsince Arrow API is now being more stable, and using pandas udf will perform much better than python udf.\r\n\r\n### What has been done in this pull request?\r\nI am  proposing to support RowToColumnarExec with Arrow.\r\n\r\nWhat I did in this PR is to add a load api in ArrowColumnVector to load arrowRecordBatch to ArrowColumnVector, then called inside RowToColumnarExec doExecute.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUTs are also added to test this new API and RowToColumnarExec with ArrowFormat.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Chendi Xue

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix a bug in `TestUtils.isPythonVersionAtLeast38` to allow for `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` to test against Spark 2.x releases in environments with Python <= 3.7.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe logic in `TestUtils.isPythonVersionAtLeast38` was added in #30044 to prevent Spark 2.4 from being run in an environment where the Python3 version installed was >= Python 3.8, which is not compatible with Spark 2.4. However, this method always returns true, so only Spark 3.x versions will ever be included in the version set for `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite`, regardless of the system-installed version of Python.\r\n\r\nThe problem is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/951efb80856e2a92ba3690886c95643567dae9d0/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/TestUtils.scala#L280-L291\r\nIt's trying to evaluate the version of Python using a `ProcessLogger`, but the logger accepts a `String => Unit` function, i.e., it does not make use of the return value in any way (since it's meant for logging). So the result of the `startsWith` checks are thrown away, and `attempt.isSuccess && attempt.get == 0` will always be true as long as your system has a `python3` binary (of any version).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, test changes only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nConfirmed by checking that `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` downloads binary distros for Spark 2.x lines as well as 3.x when I symlink my `python3` to Python 3.7, and only downloads distros for the 3.x lines when I symlink my `python3` to Python 3.9.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbrew link --force python@3.7\r\n# run HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite and validate that 2.x and 3.x tests get executed\r\nbrew unlink python@3.7\r\nbrew link --force python@3.9\r\n# run HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite and validate that only 3.x tests get executed\r\n```","created_at":"2021-10-26T18:05:02Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T21:04:25Z","closed_at":"2021-10-28T00:46:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a379a5154331eec2aff2aae03c7e78d5ccf4bcae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/535fe4468dca2c07a536f5950d6d393db0e09303","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-37121-testutils-python38-fix","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-37121-testutils-python38-fix","sha":"535fe4468dca2c07a536f5950d6d393db0e09303","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nInvalidate the table cache after alter table properties (set and unset).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe table properties can change the behavior of wriing. e.g. the parquet table with `parquet.compression`.\r\n\r\nIf you execute the following SQL, we will get the file with snappy compression rather than zstd.\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t (c int) STORED AS PARQUET;\r\n// cache table metadata\r\nSELECT * FROM t;\r\nALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES('parquet.compression'='zstd');\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE t values(1);\r\n```\r\nSo we should invalidate the table cache after alter table properties.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add an util function to raise advice warning for pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\nApart from the existing warnings recognized by general Python, PySpark and pandas users, these warnings are things to pay special attention to in the pandas API on Spark, so I think it is better to manage warnings separately.\r\n\r\nThis PR basically do:\r\n- Add util function, `log_advice` to raise `UserWarning` with proper message.\r\n- Add `log_advice` to the APIs where needs showing the advice.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe pandas API on Spark has functions that the existing pandas users who are not familiar with distributed environment should aware for avoiding confusion (not only confusion, it also could cause the serious performance degradation).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- `sort_index`, `len`, `sort_values`: such functions can cause the performance degradation since it goes through the entire data set\r\n- `to_xxx`, `read_xxx`: if the `index_col` is not specified for some I/O functions, the default index is attached which is expensive (and also the existing index will be lost)\r\n- `to_list`, `to_pandas`, `to_markdown`: such functions load the whole data into the driver's memory, so potentially could cause the OOM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the pandas-on-Spark users can see the warning when they're using inefficient or potentially dangerous functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually check the behavior one-by-one.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([1, 2, 3, 4])\r\n>>> psser.to_list()\r\n.../spark/python/pyspark/pandas/utils.py:968: PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning: `to_list` loads the all data into the driver's memory. It should only be used if the resulting list is expected to be small.\r\n  warnings.warn(message, PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning)\r\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n```","created_at":"2021-10-26T04:08:42Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T16:19:15Z","closed_at":"2021-10-28T02:38:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d578c6f6de37daf31664b66379fc34ce349b52d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c7b61fb02e57ac637706f43690c48ec080910997","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-37036","ref":"SPARK-37036","sha":"c7b61fb02e57ac637706f43690c48ec080910997","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fb9d6aeb788d2e869e09f18014c966b51aa3af20","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRedundant exclusions were removed for hadoop-cloud module so the build output contains required dependency for hadoop-azure artifact (ackson-mapper-asl).\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Hadoop ABFS connector (for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2) is broken due to missing dependency. So required dependencies for hadoop-azure artifact should be included into distribution output if hadoop-cloud module enabled.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnfortunately Microsoft does not provide support for Data Lake Storage Gen2 within azurite emulator - so the change was tested manually and the diff was checked to see if anything else was picked up for build outputs (before and after the change). So the only change is inclusion of jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.13.jar.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-25T18:14:23Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T15:58:25Z","closed_at":"2021-10-30T16:23:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1693d357b3ec4b94754b89eef681c13963a95c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f2209fff74b39ba2333cf6d6f51063115e3b5a85","head":{"label":"vmalakhin:SPARK-37102","ref":"SPARK-37102","sha":"f2209fff74b39ba2333cf6d6f51063115e3b5a85","user":{"login":"vmalakhin","id":49170798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTcwNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49170798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin","html_url":"https://github.com/vmalakhin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":421117213,"node_id":"R_kgDOGRm9HQ","name":"spark","full_name":"vmalakhin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vmalakhin","id":49170798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTcwNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49170798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin","html_url":"https://github.com/vmalakhin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmalakhin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vmalakhin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the MiMa failure with Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-36151 (#34306) re-enabled MiMa for Scala 2.13 but it always fails in the scheduled build.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/runs/3992588994?check_suite_focus=true#step:9:2303\r\nThe reason is that `dev/mima` and `MimaBuild` don't consider `2.13`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nMiMa passed on GA with modified GA config (set `SCALA_PROFILE` to `scala2.13`).\r\nhttps://github.com/sarutak/spark/runs/3998022279?check_suite_focus=true#step:9:19919\r\n\r\nI also confirmed that `dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.12` and `dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13` are idempotent.","created_at":"2021-10-25T16:29:42Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T00:44:06Z","closed_at":"2021-10-26T00:44:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a39e5092c6af454d8391b1fcf47dc7667f0c7f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dd9688558e70a8498556b1fa3129808749dac1f2","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-mima-build-scala-2.13","ref":"fix-mima-build-scala-2.13","sha":"dd9688558e70a8498556b1fa3129808749dac1f2","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nInvalidate the table cache after alter table properties (set and unset).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe table properties can change the behavior of wriing. e.g. the parquet table with `parquet.compression`.\r\n\r\nIf you execute the following SQL, we will get the file with snappy compression rather than zstd.\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t (c int) STORED AS PARQUET;\r\n// cache table metadata\r\nSELECT * FROM t;\r\nALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES('parquet.compression'='zstd');\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE t values(1);\r\n```\r\nSo we should invalidate the table cache after alter table properties.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

Let's take simple `RDD` to `DataFrame` as an example. Currently, the following code will not type check\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\nsc = spark.sparkContext\r\n\r\nrdd = sc.parallelize([(1, 2)])\r\nreveal_type(rdd)\r\n\r\nspark.createDataFrame(rdd)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.py:8: note: Revealed type is \"pyspark.rdd.RDD[Tuple[builtins.int, builtins.int]]\"\r\nmain.py:10: error: Argument 1 to \"createDataFrame\" of \"SparkSession\" has incompatible type \"RDD[Tuple[int, int]]\"; expected \"Union[RDD[Tuple[Any, ...]], Iterable[Tuple[Any, ...]]]\"\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo type check, `rdd` would have to be annotated with specific type, matching the signature of the `createDataFrame` method:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nrdd: RDD[Tuple[Any, ...]] = sc.parallelize([(1, 2)])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, one could inline definition:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.createDataFrame(sc.parallelize([(1, 2)]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with `pyspark.mllib`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nfrom pyspark.mllib.clustering import KMeans\r\nfrom pyspark.mllib.linalg import SparseVector, Vectors\r\n\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\nsc = spark.sparkContext\r\n\r\nrdd = sc.parallelize([\r\n    Vectors.sparse(10, [1, 3, 5], [1, 1, 1]),\r\n    Vectors.sparse(10, [2, 4, 6], [1, 1, 1]),\r\n])\r\n\r\nKMeans.train(rdd, 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe'd get\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.py:14: error: Argument 1 to \"train\" of \"KMeans\" has incompatible type \"RDD[SparseVector]\"; expected \"RDD[Union[ndarray[Any, Any], Vector, List[float], Tuple[float, ...]]]\"\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this time, we'd need much more complex annotation (inlining would work as well):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nrdd: RDD[Union[ndarray[Any, Any], Vector, List[float], Tuple[float, ...]]] = sc.parallelize([\r\n    Vectors.sparse(10, [1, 3, 5], [1, 1, 1]),\r\n    Vectors.sparse(10, [2, 4, 6], [1, 1, 1]),\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because\r\n\r\n- RDD is invariant in terms of stored type.\r\n- mypy doesn't look forward to infer types of objects depending on the usage context (similarly to Scala console / spark-shell, but unlike standalone Scala compiler, which allows us to have [examples like this](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/KMeansExample.scala))\r\n\r\nIt not only makes things verbose, but also fragile and dependent on details of implementation. In the first example, where we have top level `Union`, we can just use `RDD[...]` and ignore other members.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, where `Union` is a type parameter we have to match all its components (it could be simpler if we didn't use `RDD[VectorLike]` but defined something like `RDD[ndarray] | RDD[Vector] | RDD[List[float]] | RDD[Tuple[float, ...]]]`, which should make it closer to the first case, though not semantically equivalent to the current signature).\r\n\r\nTheoretically, we could partially address this with different definitions of aliases, like using type bounds (see discussion under #34354), but it doesn't scale well and requires same steps to be taken by every library that depends on PySpark.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also related discussion about Scala counterpart ‒ SPARK-1296\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nType hints only.\r\n\r\nUsers will be able to use both subclasses of `RDD` / `DStream` in certain contexts, without explicit annotations or casts (both examples will pass type checker in their original form).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to switch from Maven to SBT to build Spark on AppVeyor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRecently, building Spark on AppVeyor almost always fails due to StackOverflowError at compile time.\r\nWe can't identify the reason so far but one workaround would be building with SBT.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAppVeyor

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe previous PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34245 assumed task completion listeners are registered bottom-up. `ParquetFileFormat#buildReaderWithPartitionValues()` violates this assumption by registering a task completion listener to close its output iterator lazily. Since task completion listeners are executed in reverse order of registration, this listener always runs before other listeners. When the downstream operator contains a Python UDF and the off-heap vectorized Parquet reader is enabled, this results in a use-after-free that causes a segfault.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to close the output iterator using FileScanRDD's task completion listener.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the Python tests introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34245 are flaky ([see details in thread](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34245#issuecomment-948713545)). They intermittently fail with a segfault.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRepeatedly ran one of the Python tests introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34245 using the commands below. Previously, the test was flaky and failed after about 50 runs. With this PR, the test has not failed after 1000 runs.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./build/sbt -Phive clean package && ./build/sbt test:compile\r\nseq 1000 | parallel -j 8 --halt now,fail=1 'echo {#};

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are 9 UTs failed in `repl` run with Java 17, the all failed tests have similar error stack as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalAccessException: Can not set final $iw field $Lambda$2879/0x000000080188b928.arg$1 to $iw\r\n    at

`read-only` field  through the reflection api when use Java 17, the `read-only` field is defined as `private final field (trustedFinal=true)` .\r\n\r\nSo this pr try to remove the `final` modifier before `outerField.set(func, clonedOuterThis)` in `ClosureCleaner#clean` method  and reset  the modifier value after `outerField.set(func, clonedOuterThis)`  when use Java 17.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in order to use the API  in `java.lang.reflect` mod, `--add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED` is added to `pom.xml`, `SparkBuild.scala` and `JavaModuleOptions.java`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPass UT with JDK 17\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Manual test use Java17 build + Java17 run (both openjdk version \"17\" 2021-09-14 LTS)\r\n\r\nUse Java 17 to run the following two commands\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -pl repl -am

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nintroduce a new node `RankLimit` to filter out uncessary rows based on rank computed on partial dataset.\r\n\r\nit supports following pattern:\r\n\r\n```\r\n select (... (row_number|rank|dense_rank)() over ( [partition by ...] order by ... ) as rn)\r\n    where rn (==|<|<=) k and other conditions\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor these three rank functions (row_number|rank|dense_rank), the rank of a key computed on partitial dataset  always  <=  its final rank computed on the whole dataset，so we can safely discard rows with partitial rank > `k`, anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, reduce the shuffle write;\r\n2, solve skewed-window problem, a practical case was optimized from 2.5h to 26min\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\na new config is added\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1, added testsuits, practical cases on our production system\r\n\r\n2, 10TiB TPC-DS -

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nInvalidate the table cache after alter table properties (set and unset).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe table properties can change the behavior of wriing. e.g. the parquet table with `parquet.compression`.\r\n\r\nIf you execute the following SQL, we will get the file with snappy compression rather than zstd.\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t (c int) STORED AS PARQUET;\r\n// cache table metadata\r\nSELECT * FROM t;\r\nALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES('parquet.compression'='zstd');\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE t values(1);\r\n```\r\nSo we should invalidate the table cache after alter table properties.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `external/avro` module test with Java 17 has 2 UT failed, the reason for the failure is that the content of the error message  fragment used for assertion has changed from \r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: null of string in string in field Name of test_schema in test_schema\r\n``` \r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"Object.getClass()\" because \"datum\" is null of string in string in field Name of test_schema in test_schema\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change should be caused by `JEP 358: Helpful NullPointerExceptions`.\r\n\r\nSo the change of this pr is  splits one assertion into two assertions to be compatible with different Java versions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPass UT with JDK 17\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Manual test  use Java 17\r\n\r\n`mvn clean install -pl external/avro`\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\nRun completed in 49 seconds, 212 milliseconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 283\r\nSuites: completed 14,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nProperly fallback to `Hive.get` when `Hive.getWithoutRegisterFns` is unavailable to a Hive version.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-35321 we switched to use the new method `Hive.getWithoutRegisterFns` introduced by [HIVE-21563](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21563). The code path is supposed to only active for Hive versions that are >= 2.3.9. However, due to how `HiveVersion` is initialized in `IsolatedClientLoader`, if users set `spark.sql.hive.metastore.version` to `2.3.8`, Spark will still convert it to \"2.3.9\" and thus will subsequently fail with `NoSuchMethodError`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes it by always fallback on `NoSuchMethodError`. By doing this we are also able to support other Hive versions with `Hive.getWithoutRegisterFns` implemented.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI manually tested via launching a Spark session with custom Hive version:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --conf spark.sql.hive.metastore.version=2.3.8 --conf spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars=\"/tmp/apache-hive-2.3.8-bin/lib/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then tried this command:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\nval spark = SparkSession.builder()\r\n  .master(\"local[*]\")\r\n  .enableHiveSupport()\r\n  .config(\"spark.sql.hive.metastore.version\", \"2.3.8\")\r\n  .config(\"spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars\", \"/tmp/apache-hive-2.3.8-bin/lib/*\")\r\n  .getOrCreate()\r\nspark.sql(\"show tables\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe command is failing before this PR, but working afterwards.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-21T19:07:01Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T16:41:41Z","closed_at":"2021-10-22T04:31:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61a78724f4fb575d358688fa210e107eb3cced9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34360/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34360/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34360/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b5c7054cacb0167033bc45ffd0946c28cde6eabe","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-37069","ref":"SPARK-37069","sha":"b5c7054cacb0167033bc45ffd0946c28cde6eabe","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`Mockito` can't mock `j.u.Random` with Java 17 due to `module java.base does not export jdk.internal.util.random to unnamed module` and  there are some UTs in `mllib-local` and `mllib` module failed with Java 17. \r\n\r\nSo the main change of this pr is add `--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.util.random=ALL-UNNAMED` to `extraTestJavaArgs` to make all UTs passed in `mllib-local` and `mllib` module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPass UT with JDK 17\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Manual test with Java 17\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -pl mllib-local\r\nmvn clean install -pl

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the anonymous functions in OpenHashMap to member methods. This avoid having a member which captures the OpenHashMap object in its closure. This fixes so that OpenHashMap instances can be serialized with Kryo with reference tracking turned off.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why the original implementation had the anonymous function members in the first place. But if it was implemented that way for performance reason another possible fix is just to mark the `grow` and `move` members as transient.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUser might want to turn off referenceTracking in kryo since it has performance benefits, but currently this will unnecessary and unexpectedly prevent them from using some features of spark that uses OpenHashMap internally.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests and a new test in the `KryoSerializerSuite`.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-21T07:26:39Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T11:21:50Z","closed_at":"2021-10-27T13:58:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58ae56615027e54714f5dc3ddb83683da166db5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406607243,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3MjQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/GRAPHX","name":"GRAPHX","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1e9edeae385fff3ecac30e8caee0564b1f8d3ef5","head":{"label":"eejbyfeldt:SPARK-37071-make-open-hash-map-serialize-without-reference-tracking","ref":"SPARK-37071-make-open-hash-map-serialize-without-reference-tracking","sha":"1e9edeae385fff3ecac30e8caee0564b1f8d3ef5","user":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373800628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzM4MDA2Mjg=","name":"spark","full_name":"eejbyfeldt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support 3-parameter Sink constructors which have `SecurityManager` as the 3rd parameter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.2.0 cannot load old Sink libraries because SPARK-34520 removed `SecurityManager` parameter and try to create Sink class with new two-parameter constructor only.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis will recover the breaking change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test coverage.","created_at":"2021-10-20T23:58:06Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T02:57:14Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T02:05:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc9695eb877cbc4c2565ce9a8e8f7288bdd97768","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e7c3bec5b76e9f5b54a41cea56af9665cc0199d4","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-37078","ref":"SPARK-37078","sha":"e7c3bec5b76e9f5b54a41cea56af9665cc0199d4","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"eda3fd0948b7328ec496ee6623e9c30e2dacbfb3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache
