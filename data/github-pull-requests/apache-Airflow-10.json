#33210 \r\n\r\nThere are workflows where users need to quickly switch between dags. Returning to home page to search takes time and also loads dags list data and makes other queries which are not needed. Add a search widget in the top navbar so that users can search and results are returned like legacy home page search. Then users can click on the result to switch to the relevant dag page. The component uses `AsyncSelect` to fetch options on type and uses debounce to limit queries. The results are limited to 10 so that the queries are faster and uses existing dags endpoint used by home page search without recent runs data. \r\n\r\nNotes to reviewer and self\r\n\r\n* debounce-promise is needed since use-debounce doesn't work with promises . Ref : https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/3075#issuecomment-450194917\r\n* `staleTime` is set as zero so that queries are not cached and results are live to search for dags added recently after a search for the term.\r\n* There are autocomplete components for Chakra but they are not compatible with Chakra 3 . Ref : https://github.com/anubra266/choc-autocomplete/issues/272 \r\n* There could be a custom endpoint with just `dag_id` and `dag_display_name` but with 10 entries the size is low at 2kB compressed and 8-9kB uncompressed and doesn't seem to be worth it to have a separate endpoint. Probably if needed can be taken as an enhancement in another PR.\r\n\r\n![dags_search_modal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eba4960-7322-4975-8990-86d6601033e3)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-24T17:38:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T18:47:04Z","closed_at":"2025-01-08T18:47:04Z","merged_at":"2025-01-08T18:47:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"39d7f1cae6c63a467318368b63e705fe4d2cd783","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

A new worker pod is not spun up to replace it, and the task fails with the below error message. \r\n```\r\n{task_context_logger.py:104} ERROR - Executor reports task instance <TaskInstance: dag_id.task_id scheduled__2024-10-20T02:00:00+00:00 [queued]> finished (failed) although the task says it's queued. (Info: None) Was the task killed externally?\r\n```\r\nThis failure is triggered by [this line in the source code](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/43d7c1c5b6a83694c9c526ab9bc29cc1a87c4ef3/providers/src/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/executors/kubernetes_executor_utils.py#L237). \r\n\r\nIf the task is not failed upon worker pod deletion, it will remain in the queued state until it reaches `task_queued_timeout`. Once this timeout is reached, internal retries will be allowed due to [PR #43520](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43520) and a new worker pod will be spun up for the task. Therefore, if the first worker pod was deleted or evicted due to a temporary issue, the task will be able to run on the newly spun up worker pod.   \r\n\r\nIn this PR, I have removed the code that fails the task when its pending worker pod is deleted. This will prevent task failures from temporary issues with pending worker pods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR aims to fix a small bug in GCSToGCSOperator when copy single object with replace to False.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when replace set to False, the set operation is used to check replacing file(s).\r\nIt works well except in line 412 of _copy_source_without_wildcard function that check `objects` is a single object. An error occurred while this if statement tries to get element by index from set object.\r\n`if len(objects) == 1 and objects[0][-1] != \"/\":`\r\nI simply convert back to a list. It will not affect other downstream because other `objects` are a list too.\r\n\r\nI also attached an error log that I found this bug last month.\r\n![IMG_5918](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bf28f86-6d0b-428d-949c-d912d1bae48a)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

suggested in issue #44759.\r\n\r\nThe new content provides guidance on:\r\n- Pushing XComs when deferred tasks exit directly from triggers.\r\n- How to integrate `_push_xcoms_if_necessary` with custom triggers.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #44759.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n- Added a new section under **Exiting deferred task from Triggers** in `deferring.rst` to describe the `_push_xcoms_if_necessary` method and its usage.\r\n- Included example code snippets to illustrate the implementation.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation updated.\r\n- [x] Code quality checks passed (pre-commit hooks run).\r\n\r\n### Reviewers\r\nPlease suggest any further refinements or additional examples if required.\r\n\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes,

PR focuses on updating and formatting the contributors quick start guide.\r\n\r\nAs a new experimenting contributor, I had some troubles when I worked with the quick start guide, some commands that didn't work because of outdated packages, some instructions were unclear etc.\r\n\r\nAddressing major changes I did:\r\n1. Moving down the installation of the `docker compose plugin`: If we already have a section that is dedicated to the installation of docker compose, then commands that are relevant to its installation should be there, and not in a section that is dedicated to the installation of purely docker.\r\n2. Sqlite -> sqlite3: according to the [Ubuntu package repository](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=sqlite), the package `sqlite` is available only on `focal` and `jammy` Ubuntu distribution codenames. This means that the command `sudo apt install sqlite` will not work with any distributions beyond other than these two (like oracular, noble etc.). As I see it, these are the options:\r\na. Move to `sqlite3`. This would require performing tests, which I have - ran all the tests under the ./tests directory, which is probably not sufficient.\r\nb. Add a note excluding distributions other than focal and jammy to use sqlite3 instead. This means developing on machines with distributions other than these may lead to inconsistencies as a result of breaking changes between the versions unless compatibility checks are done. \r\nThis is very likely larger than my PR, and the best course of action for now is probably to delay this change until a decision is made, I made the changes only to raise awareness.\r\n3. Removing section describing pre-commit with uv (lines 466-479): this content was just duplicated with the few lines below it. There are more examples of this behavior, but they are less aggressive so I decided to leave them be.\r\n\r\nThe other changes I made are mostly cosmetic.","created_at":"2024-12-21T15:10:33Z","updated_at":"2024-12-24T13:46:00Z","closed_at":"2024-12-24T13:43:56Z","merged_at":"2024-12-24T13:43:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"a540eeb73f3363ebcb8ce000b77d0b7b8d04a002","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/45133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/45133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/45133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a86784711722a0db4bae5bba3d72ee80e85ff9ba","head":{"label":"IlaiGigi:update-contributors-quick-start-guide","ref":"update-contributors-quick-start-guide","sha":"a86784711722a0db4bae5bba3d72ee80e85ff9ba","user":{"login":"IlaiGigi","id":89356974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MzU2OTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89356974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi","html_url":"https://github.com/IlaiGigi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":900297434,"node_id":"R_kgDONaly2g","name":"airflow","full_name":"IlaiGigi/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"IlaiGigi","id":89356974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MzU2OTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89356974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi","html_url":"https://github.com/IlaiGigi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlaiGigi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/IlaiGigi/airflow","description":"Apache

providers system tests were modified in provider tests were modified, selective checks had two bugs that compounded led to provider tests being skipped.\r\n\r\n1) Modification of system tests lead to \"all providers affected\"\r\n   condition (wrongly) - because \"TESTS\" were checked as root path\r\n   before \"SYSTEM TESTS\" - and since system tests were subfolder\r\n   of tests, the code that checked if system tests path belongs\r\n   to provider never found it.\r\n\r\n2) \"All Providers affected\" in such case (when it was not caused by\r\n   another condition lead to \"skip-provider-tests\" set to true due\r\n   to missing \"else\" in one of the conditions.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both cases and simplifies the conditions so that they are easier to understand and modify. Those conditions will be further simplified when we separate providers to separate projects #44511 because there we will not have to check separately several sub-folders of airflow, but for now it's good enough.\r\n\r\nSome of those conditions are simplified as well because we are in Python 3.9+ and \"is_relative_to\" is now available in Path.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

That is unlike mapped operators with indeces `-1` or `0`, as well as unmapped operators.\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, this inconsistency doesn't affect any logic that depends on it, since it is still deserialized as Python's `None` - but it will be nice to save a few bytes and ensure consistency.\r\nWhile I haven't figured out *why* it happens only in that case - I've found that applying the flag `should_evaluate_none = True` seems to solve it. I didn't find a proper way to test it, since it is always deserialized as Python's `None`.\r\n\r\nMapped operators are yet to be implemented in the `main` with the new task sdk, but if tests won't indicate that it breaks anything - I think that it will be ok to merge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\ncloses: #44351\r\n\r\n\"Retries\" are majorly handled in airflow 2.x in here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L3082-L3101.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that in case a task is retry able, defined by https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L1054-L1073, the task is marked as \"up_for_retry\". Rest of the part is taken care by the scheduler loop normally if the ti state is marked correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nComing to task sdk, we cannot perform validations such as https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L1054-L1073 in the task runner / sdk side because we do not have/ should not have access to the database. \r\n\r\n![image (7)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc33ad10-5859-4fcd-a17d-7faba61463d2)\r\n\r\nWe can use the above state change diagram and handle the retry state while handling failed state. Instead of having API handler and states for \"up_for_retry\", we can handle it when we are handling failures - which we do by calling the https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api_fastapi/execution_api/routes/task_instances.py#L160-L212 API endpoint. If we can send in enough data to the api handler in the execution API, we should be able to handle the cases of retry well.\r\n\r\n### What needs to be done for porting this to `task_sdk`?\r\n1. Defining \"try_number\", \"max_retries\" for task instances ---> not needed because this is handled already in the scheduler side of things / parsing time and not at execution time, so we do not need to handle it. It is handled here https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/dagrun.py#L1445-L1471 when a dag run is created and it is initialised with the initial values: max_tries(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L1809) and try_number(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L1808)\r\n\r\n2. We need to have a mechanism that can send a signal from the task runner if retries are defined. We will send this in this fashion:\r\ntask runner informs the supervisor while failing that it needs to retry -> supervisor sends a normal request to the client (but with task_retries defined) -> client sends a normal API request (TITerminalStatePayload) to the execution API but with task_retries\r\n\r\n3. At the execution API, we receive the request and perform a check to check if the Ti is eligible for retry, if it is, we mark it as \"up_for_retry\", the rest of things are taken care by the scheduler.\r\n\r\n### Approach chosen\r\n\r\n- We define a new state: `FAIL_WITHOUT_RETRY`, if the task runner sends a request that it wants to `FAIL_WITHOUT_RETRY`, we do not need to retry, this is done so that we prioritise retry over no retry. The cases where we should retry is far more than when we shouldn't. \r\n- `FAIL_WITHOUT_RETRY` is sent out for cases such as `AirflowFailException` or `AirflowSensorTimeout`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Handling on task runner and execution side\r\n1. The task is executed normally, and in cases when there is a failure, it is handled in this way:\r\nFor AirflowFailException, AirflowSensorTimeout, AirflowTaskTerminated, send FAIL_WITHOUT_RETRY\r\nFor any other case, send FAIL.\r\n\r\n2. If `FAILED` state is sent, we attempt the retry.\r\n\r\n#### Handling at execution API\r\n1. For the case when we receive FAILED,\r\n```\r\n        elif ti_patch_payload.state == State.FAILED:\r\n            if _is_eligible_to_retry(previous_state, try_number, max_tries):\r\n                updated_state = State.UP_FOR_RETRY\r\n            else:\r\n                updated_state = State.FAILED\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. For case where we receive FAIL_WITHOUT_RETRY, just fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing results\r\nRight now the PR is meant to handle `BaseException` -- will extend to all other eligible TI exceptions in follow ups.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Scenario 1: With retries = 3 defined. \r\n\r\nDAG:\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom time import sleep\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Added `from_xcom_response` and `from_variable_response` class methods in XComResult and VariableResult, respectively, to convert autogenerated API responses into runtime-compatible result models.\r\n\r\n- Updated the supervisor’s `handle_requests` method to use these converters for `GetXCom` and `GetVariable` message handling.\r\n- Adjusted tests in test_supervisor.py to verify the inclusion of the type field in serialized responses and ensure proper decoding using CommsDecoder.\r\n- Improved test coverage by asserting that serialized responses match expected formats and verifying deserialization consistency.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
