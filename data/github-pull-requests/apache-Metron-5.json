Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR changes the default field renaming behavior in the ElasticsearchWriter to NOOP.  Metron uses '.' characters in field names by default so this means the separator in ES field names is changed from ':' to '.'.  While the this specific change was simple, it cascaded to several different parts of the code base.  This is the reason for the rather large PR.\r\n\r\nOne important implication I would like to point out is that changing field names to '.'s causes ES to interpret them as object field types.  There are various places in this PR where I had to account for that and is something reviewers should keep in mind while testing.  This is a fairly significant change and it makes me a little nervous.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- Change the FieldNameConverter to default to NOOP instead of DEDOT\r\n- Updated constants (MetaAlertConstants.THREAT_FIELD_DEFAULT, etc) to use '.'s\r\n- Changed the legacy `source:type` field to `metron_sensor_type`.  I was not able to change it to `source.type` because the bro template defines a `source` field.  ES does not allow this (see my object field type comment above):  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/dots-in-names.html#_upgrading_fields_with_dots_to_5_x.  The `metron_sensor_type` is similar to other dedicated fields like `metron_alert` so it made sense to me.  There is really no reason we need to have a separate in that field name anyways.\r\n- Change fields in tests and test data to use '.' instead.  I only changed this in tests that were failing so there still may be tests with ':' in field names.\r\n- Changed the field names in the alerts UI code to use '.' instead of ':' and also made the `metron_sensor_type` change.  I tried to replace hard-coded field names with constants where appropriate to make this easier in the future (hopefully we never have to do this again).\r\n- Updated ES templates to use the new field name conventions and updated Solr schemas to use the new `source.type` name.  ES dynamic templates also required a switch from the `match` attribute to `path_match` (see my object field type comment above).\r\n- I had to significantly change the ElasticsearchColumnMetadataDao class to pull field names out of the column metadata response recursively since they are now nested (see my object field type comment above).  For example, without this change `threat.triage.score` would be returned only as `threat` because there are other field names that start with `threat.triage.*`.  I also updated ElasticsearchSearchIntegrationTest to test for this case.\r\n- Updated the global config `source.type.field` and `threat.triage.score.field` settings to match the new field names.  These settings are probably useless now.\r\n- Updated the Solr README by removing some steps that are now unnecessary for enabling Solr in Metron.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI am still working my way through testing.  I have run several tests in full dev including:\r\n\r\n- Verified data in bro and snort indexes looks correct.\r\n- Verified the basic features in the alerts UI still work.  This includes all fields showing up and being able to filter on the fields that were updated to follow the new naming format.\r\n- Verified the column metadata REST endpoint returns fields and types as expected.  As a bonus, dynamic fields that have been indexed are now returned with the correct type (I don't think this worked before).\r\n- Verified the metaalert feature still works correctly\r\n- Verified switching to Solr works as expected and performing the tests listed above\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are test cases I'm missing since this is change cuts across so many parts of Metron.  Still trying to think of more but feel free to add to this list.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\nThere are a couple outstanding items and unfinished tasks:\r\n\r\n- I only updated the Solr README.  There are several places in our READMEs that reference fields with the ':' separator.  Is it worth updating our docs to reflect the changes to our field names?  I am still looking through the READMEs for spots that obviously need updating (related to `metron_sensor_type` specifically).\r\n- The change to the `metron_sensor_type` field name is reflected in the UI.  Is this ok?\r\n- Should we review and update field names in all tests, even unit tests where the actual field name isn't crucial?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for reviewing this beast.  Hopefully the complexity and size of this PR is worth the benefits it offers.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nThis changes so we support any version of Ansible, [v2.4.0](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/v2.4.0.0-1) and newer, and displays a clean message if the version of ansible being used is older than that.  2.4 was released in September of 2017 and is the lowest version that also lets us get rid of [these](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_includes.html#includes-vs-imports) deprecation warnings.\r\n\r\nThis is on hold for the moment, as reliably checking the version of ansible pre-syntax checking/failure doesn't have a supported approach.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTo test, spin up full-dev with any version of ansible < 2.4.0 and expect failure, then upgrade to => 2.4.0 and expect success.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

Description\r\n\r\n* When using Kryo serialization, specifically in Storm, the class being serialized must have a no-arg constructor.\r\n\r\n* The existing unit tests that validated Kryo serialization for the Profiler classes (that I added for #1012 ) use the `SerDeUtils` class to test Kryo serialization.  I found that this class sets up Kryo in a slightly different way from how Storm does internally.  This is one reason why the tests did not catch the missing no-arg constructor.\r\n\r\n* The `ProfileMeasurementTest`'s setup method was missing the `@Before` annotation so it was never called.  This caused the test to validate serialization of a null, rather than an actual object.  Doh!\r\n\r\n* Removed the 'asm' dependency from 'metron-profiler-common'.  Conflicting version of this library was causing issues with the Kryo serialization tests (once they actually tested serializing something other than nulls).  There is now no dependency on Storm from `metron-profiler-common`, which is how it should be.\r\n\r\n* The unit tests now catch this bug and highlighted a few other classes that needed a no-arg constructor. \r\n\r\n* The only piece left wanting is that I'd like to have seen the integration tests fail if Kryo serialization fails.  That was the original intent of using `topology.testing.always.try.serialize=true` for the integration test.  But that only seems to catch Java serialization problems, not Kryo for some reason.\r\n\r\n* This serialization error will never show itself if you are running with a single worker as there is no need for Storm to serialize.  Even running the Profiler in a cluster on multiple workers, it will only show-up if Storm runs the `ProfileBuilderBolt` and the downstream bolts (`HBaseBolt` or `KafkaBolt`) on a separate worker.  This is why you may not always see the problem when running on a cluster (and why it was confusing to track down.)\r\n\r\n### Work Around\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing this issue, you can work around the problem by changing the following values in your `profiler.properties`.  This will cause Storm to fall-back to Java serialization when Kryo serialization fails in Storm for `org.apache.metron.common.configuration.profiler.ProfileResult`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntopology.fall.back.on.java.serialization=true\r\ntopology.kryo.register=[ org.apache.metron.profiler.ProfileMeasurement, \\\r\n    org.apache.metron.profiler.ProfilePeriod, \\\r\n    org.apache.metron.common.configuration.profiler.ProfileResultExpressions, \\\r\n    org.apache.metron.common.configuration.profiler.ProfileTriageExpressions, \\\r\n    org.apache.metron.common.configuration.profiler.ProfilerConfig, \\\r\n    org.apache.metron.common.configuration.profiler.ProfileConfig, \\\r\n    org.json.simple.JSONObject, \\\r\n    org.json.simple.JSONArray, \\\r\n    java.util.LinkedHashMap, \\\r\n    org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up Full Dev\r\n\r\n1. Create  a profile by following the Profiler README as a guide.\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up this change on a multi-node cluster.  Run the profiler with multiple workers.  Create the same profile as before and ensure that values can be persisted in HBase.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR updates the build script to use `npm ci` instead of `npm install`. The former command installs exactly what is in a project's package-lock.json file, whereas the later will reference package.json and update the lock file. Besides causing confusion with an unexpected file change, `npm install` had the potential to install different package versions of dependencies in different environments depending on when the install was last done. \r\n\r\n### Test Instructions\r\nIf you run a maven build with the current master branch, you will see package-lock.json update in the alerts ui. With this PR, there is no update to the lock file.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n* Update pom.xml files in both the alerts and management ui to use `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.\r\n* Add a package-lock.json file to the management ui. There were no new dependencies added, just a locked version of dependencies that already existed in the project. This was done because the new command relies on reading the lock file to install exact versions of dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is a simple parser for *valid* [RFC 5424](http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-5424.txt) messages.\r\nIt produces JSON for the messages, including support for structured data.\r\nAll structured data will be flattened.\r\n\r\nIt's configuration allows for specifying how missing fields are handled ( \"-\" in the spec ).\r\nThey can be:\r\n\r\n- DASH ( the default and same as spec)\r\n- OMIT : the field will not be in the return set\r\n- NULL : the field will be in the return set, but as null\r\n\r\nThe parser uses the [simple-syslog-5424](https://github.com/palindromicity/simple-syslog-5424) library.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n- Build should work ;)\r\n- in full dev, parser configuration should be available\r\n- if you have a syslog 5424 compliant data source, hook it up\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order

the Storm Profiler integration tests based on improvements I made for the Spark Profiler feature branch.\r\n\r\n* The output of the Profiler is now validated using the client library; `PROFILE_GET`.  This is better validation that things are working end-to-end.\r\n\r\n* Using more telemetry messages to validate event time processing.\r\n\r\n* Added logging around cache maintenence.\r\n\r\n* Added logging of the tuple windows that are passed from Storm's WindowManager.  This can help debug issues where the time lag and window size are incorrectly set.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis only changes the integration tests and adds logging.  Running the integration tests is sufficient to test the changes there.  Running up the development environment is sufficient for the extra caution.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR contains date range validation. We added validation messages with hints also, to help the user correct a particular input problem.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1376\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-15 at 3 38 30 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/44151039-9f5ced76-a0a1-11e8-9655-c11765987b28.png\">\r\n\r\nAs a part of this changeset, we refactored pcap-filter.component to make it more aligned with some Angular best practices. We introduced ReactiveFormsModule to make form handling similar to other observable based solutions in Angular.\r\nReactiveFormsModule also helped us to remove validation logic from the HTML template, make it part of component.ts and handle more complex validations like in case of the date range.\r\n\r\nFor more details please check the following Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1724\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

separates out the Profiler code specific to the port which runs in the Stellar REPL into its own project.  This also creates a separate tarball and RPM for the Profiler in the Stellar REPL.\r\n\r\nSince there will soon be 3 ports of the Profiler; Storm, the REPL, and Spark, I want to separate out the code base so that it cleanly delineate which code is used by which port.  Soon we should have the following projects.\r\n  * metron-profiler-common: All of the common Profiler code shared amongst each port.\r\n  * metron-profiler-spark: Profiler on Spark\r\n  * metron-profiler-repl: Profiler on the Stellar REPL\r\n  * metron-profiler-storm: Profiler on Storm\r\n  * metron-profiler-client: The client code like `PROFILE_GET`, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is dependent on the following PRs .  By filtering on the last two commits, this PR can be reviewed before the others are reviewed and merged.\r\n- [x] #1163 \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Validate the development environment by ensuring alerts are visible within the Alerts UI and that the Metron Service Check in Ambari passes.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL and follow the instructions in the Profiler README to [create and execute a profile in the REPL](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler#creating-profiles).\r\n\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the README to[ deploy the same profile in Storm](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler#deploying-profiles).  Ensure that you can retrieve values from HBase using `PROFILE_GET`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies

Contributor Comments\r\nPer the discussion [here](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/94ebc9be23f6f2ec8c53f8f6b71e97d6919baf415caf534e2b25ba9b@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E), we have several votes for merging this feature branch into master.\r\n\r\nAll of the tasks included in this PR can be found in the original [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1554).  It might be worth running through a final test before we merge.  Here are the items I would suggest we include in testing:\r\n\r\n- Run queries (with various filters applied) and verify results are display in the UI\r\n- Run a query and verify results are returned with the CLI\r\n- Verify input validation is working for each UI filter input\r\n- Verify the UI can be refreshed and the currently running query is still displayed\r\n- Verify pcap queries can be configured to run in a dedicated YARN queue\r\n- Verify results can be paged through in the UI and downloaded as raw Pcap data\r\n- Verify proper error messages are returned (wireshark not installed, no results returned, etc)\r\n- Verify jobs can be killed in the UI\r\n- Verify page size, YARN queue, and finalizer thread pool can be configured in Ambari\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently only TCP packets are included in query results when fixed field filters are applied.  In the case where no filters are applied, UDP packet fields are not displayed in the UI.  This PR fixes both issues.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- updated the PcapHelper class to properly detect and parse UDP packets\r\n- moved the protocol parsing logic out of the tcp if block\r\n- the UI now populates UDP src and dst ports\r\n- added unit tests to cover each case\r\n- added mock UDP data to the UI unit tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Generate data using pycapa and the Pcap topology (should include UDP packets)\r\n2. Navigate to the Pcap UI and run a query with the `Protocol` filter set to `17`\r\n3. Results should be returned and the all fields including src and dst port should be populated\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

By filtering on the last commit, this PR can be reviewed before the others are reviewed and merged.\r\n- [x] #1161\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Build Metron.\r\n    ```\r\n    mvn clean package -DskipTests -T2C\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Build the DEBs.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/\r\n    mvn clean package -Pbuild-debs\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the DEBs were built.  There is one for the Storm Profiler and one for the Spark Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    $ find ./ -name \"metron-profiler*.deb\"\r\n    .//metron-deployment/packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-profiler_0.5.1.deb\r\n    .//metron-deployment/packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-profiler-spark_0.5.1.deb\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Stand-up a Ubuntu VM for testing the packages.  \r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Copy the Metron DEBs to the Ubuntu VM. Something like the following should work when run in the same directory where you init'd the VM.\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant scp ~/Development/metron/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/ /tmp\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR corrects the Pcap HDFS directory permissions.  When a cluster is not Kerberized, the Pcap topology runs as the Storm user.  In this case the Pcap directories should have write permission for the `hadoop` group.  When a cluster is Kerberized, the directories should have write permission for the `metron` user.\r\n\r\nThis PR duplicates the effort in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1134 and borrows code from there.  The difference is that the changes were applied to the Ambari REST component instead.  Credit for this should be given to @MohanDV.\r\n\r\nI have not tested this in full dev yet.

adds the ability to run the Batch Profiler from the command line.  This also packages up the Batch Profiler into a tarball.\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request against the `METRON-1699-create-batch-profiler` feature branch.\r\n\r\nThis is dependent on the following PRs.  By filtering on the last commit, this PR can be reviewed before the others are reviewed and merged.\r\n- [x] #1145 \r\n- [x] #1146\r\n- [x] #1148 \r\n- [x] #1147 \r\n- [x] #1150\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Start-up the development environment.  Allow Metron to run for a bit so that a fair amount of telemetry is archived in HDFS.\r\n\r\n1. Stop all Metron services.\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark2 using Ambari.\r\n    * Use Add Service > Spark2, then follow prompts.\r\n\r\n1. Deploy the Batch Profiler to the development environment.\r\n\r\n    From the host machine; outside the development VM, run the following.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant scp ../../../metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark/target/metron-profiler-spark-0.5.1-archive.tar.gz /tmp\r\n    ```\r\n    Then from the development VM, run the following.\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    cd $METRON_HOME\r\n    tar -xvf /tmp/metron-profiler-spark-0.5.1-archive.tar.gz\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a profile by editing `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json` as follows.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.5.1]# cat $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Count the number of messages in the 'indexing' topic.  This should not be changing.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell \\\r\n       --broker-list $BROKERLIST \\\r\n       --topic indexing \\\r\n       --time -1\r\n\r\n    indexing:0:8130\r\n    ```\r\n    In this case there are 8,131 messages.\r\n\r\n1. Delete any previously written profile measurements from HBase.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hbase shell\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    hbase(main):001:0> truncate 'profiler'\r\n    Truncating 'profiler' table (it may take a while):\r\n     - Disabling table...\r\n     - Truncating table...\r\n    0 row(s) in 4.1070 seconds\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Confirm that all of the messages were successfully indexed in HDFS.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/* | wc -l\r\n    8130\r\n    ```\r\n     * Remember that we found 8,130 in the indexing topic previously.  This shows that all of them were indexed in HDFS successfully.\r\n\r\n1. Alter the `$METRON_HOME/config/batch-profiler.properties` as follows.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.5.1]# cat config/batch-profiler.properties\r\n    spark.master=local\r\n    spark.app.name=Batch Profiler\r\n    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=8\r\n\r\n    profiler.period.duration=1\r\n    profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n\r\n    profiler.batch.input.path=hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Fix-up some of the Spark configuration.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    SPARK_HOME=/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client\r\n    cp  /usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/conf/hbase-site.xml $SPARK_HOME/conf/\r\n    cp $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties.template $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties\r\n    echo \"log4j.logger.org.apache.metron.profiler.spark=DEBUG\" >> $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. You may need to create the Spark history directory in HDFS (if doing this in Full Dev.)\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    hdfs dfs -mkdir /spark2-history\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. You may want to edit the log4j properties that sits in your config directory in $SPARK_HOME, or create one.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    # Set everything to be logged to the console\r\n    log4j.rootCategory=WARN, console\r\n    log4j.appender.console=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\r\n    log4j.appender.console.target=System.err\r\n    log4j.appender.console.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\r\n    log4j.appender.console.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss} %p %c{1}: %m%n\r\n\r\n    # Set the default spark-shell log level to WARN.

Run the Batch Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    cd $METRON_HOME\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/start_batch_profiler.sh\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where Safari cannot read the format of the date we are passing to the startTimeMs and endTimeMs parameters. To resolve this, I used moment js (which was already being used in the project) to get the numeric value of the time strings instead of new Date().getTime().\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nUsing Safari, run a PCAP query in the Alerts UI. If you check the request payload, it should contain the correct numeric values for the startTimeMs and endTimeMs instead of NaN, and your search results should complete the same as they would in Chrome or another browser.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR update the Pcap query panel so that a currently running query for a user is loaded when a page is refreshed.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Updated pcap-panel.component.ts to query for a running job, and if found, update the current status and start polling\r\n- Refactored pcap-panel.component.ts by moving updating status and start polling into separate functions.  This should make the class more readable and is needed to update status after querying for a running job.\r\n- Updated pcap-filters.component.ts to accept a PcapRequest as input and update filters to match the request made for the currently running job\r\n- Added functions to pcap.service.ts to get the currently running job and the pcap request for that job\r\n-  Fixed a bug in PcapServiceImpl.java where the wrong types were being used for some fields (also adjust unit tests to catch these errors in the future)\r\n- Added tests for new code\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev. \r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the Pcap panel in the Alerts UI\r\n2. Submit a query with filters and wait for progress to be > 0\r\n3. Refresh the page\r\n4. The page should look exactly the same (filters and all) and polling should continue until the job is complete\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1731\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement on handling existing PCAP output directory writing. The PcapJob is extremely permissive in values it accepts for filtering packets, however the fixed/query filter parameters are used for constructing the output directory of the MapReduce job. When the query/field value contains a colon \":\", this causes the hdfs Path object to throw a URIException.\r\n\r\n**Includes:**\r\n\r\n- token replace colons with underscores in output dir name\r\n- consolidate redundant unit test classes for Fixed and Query PCAP filters.\r\n- create an output directory formatter class to enable testing in isolation from the rest of pcapjob\r\n- consolidates the char escape convention used by fixed and query filter dir naming. Currently handle spaces, periods, apostrophes, and colons.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nThis doesn't technically require test data to validate, since it's an error that occurs prior to the job starting, though you're certainly welcome to. Run the following from the CLI and verify no exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/pcap_query.sh fixed -bp /apps/metron/pcap/input -df \"yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm\" -st 2018-07-26-00-00 -et 2018-07-26-00-10 -rpf 500 -p \"Protocol: ICMP (1)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds error handling when pdml results are requested after a pcap job has finished.  I also added a small fix to a pcap-panel-component.ts test where the job status wasn't properly set.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the Pcap tab in the Alerts UI\r\n2. Submit a Pcap query with a filter you know won't match any results\r\n3. After the job finishes you should see an error message that says \"No results found\"\r\n4. Uninstall wireshark in full dev:  `yum -y remove wireshark`\r\n5. Run a query that will produce results\r\n6. You should get an error message that includes a message about tshark not being found\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR exposes a configuration option in the Pcap CLI and REST app for the YARN queue a pcap job will be submitted to.  This configuration is passed on to the `mapreduce.job.queuename` property in the Hadoop config.  A YARN queue is set in the Pcap CLI with an additional command line option (`-yq`) and is set in the REST app as a spring property (`pcap.yarn.queue`).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Create a YARN queue named `pcap` using the YARN Queue Manager\r\n2. Ambari should prompt you, but be sure to restart the Resource Manager\r\n3. Submit a job with the Pcap CLI and add the YARN queue option:  `-yq pcap`\r\n4. While the job is running navigate to the Resource Manager UI and verify the job is running in the `pcap` queue\r\n5. Try to submit a job to a queue that doesn't exist.  You should get a clear error stating the queue is missing\r\n6. Go to Ambari > Services > Metron > REST and set the `Metron Spring options` property to `--pcap.yarn.queue=pcap`. \r\n7. Ambari will prompt you to restart REST\r\n8. Submit a job through the REST app and verify the job is running in the `pcap` queue\r\n9. Submitting jobs in the Pcap CLI without the `yq` option and submitting jobs in REST without setting the `pcap.yarn.queue` should submit to the default queue.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1730\r\n\r\nThis is piggybacking off of the Kerberos work in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1136.  I took the steps I outlined in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1130#issuecomment-407653513, as needed for testing PCAP, and added them to the Pycapa README. I also fixed some href links that weren't working in the docbook version of the site.\r\n\r\nTo test, run through the install procedure installed in the README. Run the sample command provided for producing pcap data to kafka and verify records are being written.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1728\r\n\r\nI modified the ConfigOptions interface to provide the ability to handle default values similar to the Map interface. ie getOrDefault. For PcapJob, I only improved/changed the values we expect to be user-supplied, ie start time, end time, etc., so we don't throw NPE's if a value gets lost in translation. I think we should definitely still add some validation to users via both REST and the UI similar to what is done in PcapCLI. \r\n\r\n**Note:** This PR is an improvement to existing functionality, not a regression fix.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

ports the Profiler to run in Spark.\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request against the `METRON-1699-create-batch-profiler` feature branch.\r\n\r\nThis is dependent on the follow PRs.  By filtering on the last commit, this PR can be reviewed before the others are reviewed and merged.\r\n- [x] #1145 \r\n- [x] #1146 \r\n- [x] #1148 \r\n- [x] #1147\r\n\r\nThis does not include a mechanism to launch the Batch Profiler yet.  A follow-on PR will provide a means to launch the Batch Profiler from the command line.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Test Existing Functionality\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n1. Ensure alerts are created in the Alerts UI.\r\n1. Ensure the Service Check in Ambari passes.\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the Profiler README to create a basic profile in the REPL.\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the Profiler README to create a simple profile using the Profiler topology in Storm.\r\n\r\n### Test New Functionality\r\n\r\n1. Build and install Metron.\r\n    ```\r\n    mvn clean install -DskipTests -T2C\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Edit `metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark/src/test/resources/log4j.properties` and set `log4j.logger.org.apache.metron.profiler.spark=DEBUG`.\r\n\r\n1. Run the `BatchProfilerIntegrationTest` either in your IDE or using Maven like so.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark/\r\n    mvn -Dtest=BatchProfilerIntegrationTest test    \r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. The output should look something like the following which shows that 2 profile measurements were written by the Batch Profiler.\r\n```\r\nRunning

ports the Profiler to run in Spark.\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request against the `METRON-1699-create-batch-profiler` feature branch.\r\n\r\nThis is dependent on #1145 #1146 #1148 #1147 .  By filtering on the last commit, this PR can be reviewed before the others are reviewed and merged.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Test Against Regressions\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n1. Ensure alerts are created in the Alerts UI.\r\n1. Ensure the Service Check in Ambari passes.\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the Profiler README to create a basic profile in the REPL.\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the Profiler README to create a simple profile using the Profiler topology in Storm.\r\n\r\n### Test New Functionality\r\n\r\n1. Start-up the development environment.  Allow Metron to run for a bit so that a fair amount of telemetry is archived in HDFS.\r\n\r\n1. Stop all Metron services.\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark2 using Ambari.\r\n    * Use Add Service > Spark2, then follow prompts.\r\n\r\n1. Create a profile by creating and editing a `profiler.json` file as follows.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.5.1]# cat $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Save the same Profiler configuration to Zookeeper.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.5.1]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\", conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Using Ambari, make the following configuration changes for the Profiler.\r\n    * Profiler Setup > Profile duration = 1 minute\r\n    * Profiler Setup > Window duration = 10 seconds\r\n    * Profiler Setup > Window time lag = 10 seconds\r\n    * Profiler Setup > Time to Live = 5 minutes\r\n    * Kafka > Input Topic Start = EARLIEST\r\n\r\n1. Count the number of messages in the 'indexing' topic.  This should not be changing.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell \\\r\n       --broker-list $BROKERLIST \\\r\n       --topic indexing \\\r\n       --time -1\r\n\r\n    indexing:0:8130\r\n    ```\r\n    In this case there are 8,131 messages.\r\n\r\n1. Delete any previous profile measurements from HBase.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hbase shell\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    hbase(main):001:0> truncate 'profiler'\r\n    Truncating 'profiler' table (it may take a while):\r\n     - Disabling table...\r\n     - Truncating table...\r\n    0 row(s) in 4.1070 seconds\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Confirm that all of the messages were successfully indexed in HDFS.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/* | wc -l\r\n    4065\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/snort/* | wc -l\r\n    4065\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/* | wc -l\r\n    8130\r\n    ```\r\n     * Remember that we found 8,130 in the indexing topic previously.\r\n\r\n1. Now we need to deploy the Batch Profiler.  This is not yet handled in the feature branch.\r\n\r\n1. Copy the CLI script and Batch Profiler jar to the VM.\r\n\r\n    From the host machine; outside the development VM, run the following.\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant scp ../../../metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark/target/metron-profiler-spark-0.5.1.jar /tmp\r\n    vagrant scp ../../../metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark/src/main/scripts/start_batch_profiler.sh /tmp\r\n    ```\r\n    Then from the development VM, run the following.\r\n    ```\r\n    cp /tmp/start_batch_profiler.sh $METRON_HOME/bin/\r\n    cp /tmp/metron-profiler-spark-0.5.1.jar $METRON_HOME/lib/\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a properties file for the Batch Profiler like so.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.5.1]# cat config/batch-profiler.properties\r\n    spark.master=local\r\n    spark.app.name=Batch Profiler\r\n    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=8\r\n    profiler.batch.input.path=hdfs://node1:8020/apps/metron/indexed/indexing/*/*\r\n    profiler.period.duration=1\r\n    profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

some cases you need to be able to create a `ProfilerPeriod` using an epoch timestamp.  In other cases, you need to be able to create one using the period ID.  The period ID  is a monotonically increasing value which uniquely identifies each profile period.\r\n\r\nSince both an epoch timestamp and a period ID are `Long`s, I created two separate factory methods to create a `ProfilePeriod` rather than using a public constructor directly.  This makes it much more clear as to the intended purpose.\r\n   * `ProfilePeriod.fromTimestamp`\r\n   * `ProfilePeriod.fromPeriodId`\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request against the `METRON-1699-create-batch-profiler` feature branch.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n1. Ensure alerts are created in the Alerts UI.\r\n1. Ensure the Service Check in Ambari passes.\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the Profiler README to create a basic profile in the REPL.\r\n1.

Profiler can operate using either processing time or event time.  This is controlled by the user by defining the \"timestampField\" option in their Profiler configuration.\r\n\r\nThere is logic that determines the timestamp of a message.  If the Profiler is configured to use processing time, then system time is returned by this logic.  If the Profiler is configured to use event time, then the timestamp is extracted from a message field.\r\n\r\nThis logic is currently duplicated across both ports of the Profiler; the REPL and Storm.  This should be pulled into `metron-profiler-common/` so that the logic can be shared and also used by the Spark port.\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request against the `METRON-1699-create-batch-profiler` feature branch.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n1. Ensure alerts are created in the Alerts UI.\r\n1. Ensure the Service Check in Ambari passes.\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the Profiler README to create a basic profile in the REPL.\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the Profiler README to create a simple profile using the Profiler topology in Storm.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1726\r\n\r\nWhile working on issues with multi-threading and the pcap job I found it useful  to split up the monolithic pcap integration test into multiple tests with a separate setup and teardown method using @Before/AfterClass. Also fixed a regression/bug where the integration tests were writing out to the module root instead of `target`. Added back the file output path prefix along with defaults for the PcapCLI to write to the exec dir. Verification of this PR is checking that the tests appear correct and that the integration test passes.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR updates the Pcap CLI to print the status of a running job.  I took a fairly simple approach as a first pass:  \r\n\r\n- Added a `PrintStream` member variable to PcapJob \r\n- Added a `reportStatus` method that configures that variable\r\n- Added logic to the `PcapJob.get` method to print status if the printStream variable is set\r\n\r\nThis approach keeps us from having to change the Statusable interface.  For those reviewing, what do you think of the message?  Should we format it differently or include more information?\r\n\r\nI am also considering adding a unit test for `PcapJob.get` in this PR since it doesn't exist and the changes in this PR affect that method.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.  There are several different ways to solve this.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a REST endpoint that returns the job configuration for a submitted job.  The endpoint returns a static list of properties that can be serialized and are useful for frontend applications.  Changes outside of REST were trivial because the PcapJob class already stores the configuration.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- Added a method to the Statusable interface that returns a configuration map\r\n- Added a method to the PcapService that filters the Statusable configuration and returns a subset of properties\r\n- Update unit and integration tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Testing instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and put pcap data in the `/apps/metron/pcap/input` HDFS directory\r\n2. Submit a pcap query:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\nA job status should be returned as usual.\r\n\r\n3. Now the configuration can be retrieved with the get configuration endpoint:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/job_1532356159290_0052/configuration'\r\n```\r\nA subset of properties, including those in the pcap query:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"finalOutputPath\": \"/apps/metron/pcap/output\",\r\n  \"ipSrcPort\": \"\",\r\n  \"includeReverse\": false,\r\n  \"startTimeMs\": 1449010818000,\r\n  \"endTimeMs\": 1532642418000,\r\n  \"protocol\": \"\",\r\n  \"ipDstAddr\": \"\",\r\n  \"basePath\": \"/apps/metron/pcap/input\",\r\n  \"packetFilter\": \"\",\r\n  \"ipSrcAddr\": \"\",\r\n  \"ipDstPort\": \"\",\r\n  \"numReducers\": 10,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR limits users to submitting no more than a configured number of jobs at the same time.  If a user attempts to submit more than the configured amount, a 500 status code is returned with an error message in this format:\r\n```\r\nCannot submit job because a job is already running.  Please contact the administrator to cancel job(s) with id(s) <comma-separated list of job ids>\r\n```\r\nThe limit is a spring property in this PR but could be exposed directly in Ambari in the future.\r\n\r\nA more general method was added to get jobs in a requested state.  This is used here to detect too many running jobs but could also be used to allow the UI to continue monitoring a job on browser refresh, new tab, etc.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- A new PcapService method that gets a list of job statuses for jobs that match a requested state\r\n- A new check in the PcapService.submit method that checks the number of RUNNING jobs against the configured limit\r\n- A new spring `user.job.limit` property was added to control the number of jobs a user can run simultaneously\r\n- Opportunistically fixed several pcap model object equals methods\r\n- Updated the PcapControllerIntegration test to clear the job manager after each test\r\n- Added unit and integration tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Testing instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and put pcap data in the `/apps/metron/pcap/input` HDFS directory\r\n2. Submit a pcap query:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\nA job status should be returned as usual.\r\n\r\n3. Try to submit another query right after the first submission returns a job status.  You should now get a 500 with a response similar to:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"responseCode\": 500,\r\n  \"message\": \"Cannot submit job because a job is already running.  Please contact the administrator to cancel job(s) with id(s) job_1532356159290_0017\",\r\n  \"fullMessage\": \"RestException: Cannot submit job because a job is already running.  Please contact the administrator to cancel job(s) with id(s) job_1532356159290_0017\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Kill the running job:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X DELETE --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/kill/job_1532356159290_0015'\r\n```\r\nYou should now be able to submit a job again.\r\n\r\n5. Change the user job limit by setting Ambari > Metron > Configs > REST > Metron Spring options to `--user.job.limit=2`.  You should now be able to submit 2 jobs in a row.  Submitting a third should return an error similar to step 3.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nMPack updates to go with METRON-1665. \r\n\r\nThis adds settings for the SSO, LDAP and SSL options to the mpack, and updates the fulldev blueprint to include Knox and the packaged up METRON-1665 hosts.\r\n\r\nTo test this, apply the other PRs related to METRON-1663, and run up fulldev. Each UI should redirect to KnoxSSO allowing you to authenticate against the knox demo ldap (admin:admin-password is a good sample user).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a REST endpoint for submitting a query filter type Pcap query request.\r\n\r\n### Changed Included\r\n- A new Pcap query request endpoint that submits a query filter query\r\n- Slight refactor of the PcapService and PcapServiceImpl class that changes the fixed method to a submit method that can handle either a fixed pcap request of query pcap request\r\n- Unit and integration tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Testing instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev\r\n2. Create the HDFS directories specified in application.yml\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/input\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/interim\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/output\r\n3. Put pcap data in `/apps/metron/pcap/input`\r\n4. Run a query pcap query to generate results (note the query property):\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"endTimeMs\": 1458240269424,\r\n  \"startTimeMs\": 1458240269419,\r\n  \"query\":\"ip_dst_port == 22\"\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/query'\r\n```\r\n5. Monitor the job with the get status endpoint until the job has SUCCEEDED and returns a pageTotal:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"jobId\": \"job_1532012905403_0001\",\r\n  \"jobStatus\": \"SUCCEEDED\",\r\n  \"description\": \"map: 20.0%, reduce: 0.0%\",\r\n  \"percentComplete\": 100,\r\n  \"pageTotal\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOnce the job has finished results should be present in HDFS in a location that is similar to `/apps/metron/pcap/output/user/MAP_REDUCE/job_1532012905403_0001/page-1.pcap` (job id will be different).  The pcaps in the results should match the condition specified in the \"query\" property in the request.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds MPack support for the Pcap query feature.  The pcap properties in application.yml are now exposed in Ambari.  The page size can be changed in the REST tab while the paths (changing them shouldn't be common) can be done in the Advanced tab.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- Pcap properties in REST were added to Ambari\r\n  - pcap_base_path\r\n  - pcap_base_interim_result_path\r\n  - pcap_final_output_path\r\n  - pcap_page_size\r\n- Pcap page size property can be changed in the REST config tab in Ambari\r\n- HDFS directories for the 3 path properties are created on install, similar to how HDFS directories are created in other components\r\n- Pcap topology output path now matches the default Pcap query input directory\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Testing is similar very similar to https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1123 and https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1120.  The only difference is that creating the HDFS directories in Step 2 is no longer required.\r\n\r\nAs an additional test, change the Pcap Page Size setting in the REST Configs tab in Ambari.  After running a query the number of pages should reflect the page size.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a REST endpoint that allows a user to download a pcap page in HDFS as a file to their local file system. This will allow users to save files for further investigation outside of Metron, in a tool like wireshark.\r\n\r\nA new getRawPcap method was added to the PcapService. This function gets a HDFS input stream given a path that's looked up by username, job id and page number. The stream is then copied to the http response outputstream and the appropriate response headers are set.  Filenames follow the format `pcap_{jobId}_{pageNumber}.pcap` but can be overriden by the `fileName` request parameter.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- A new Pcap download endpoint that accepts a job id and page number and returns a file for download\r\n- A new PcapService getRawPcap method that returns an input stream from an HDFS path given a username, job id and page number\r\n- Unit and integration tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev. Testing instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev\r\n2. Create the HDFS directories specified in application.yml\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/input\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/interim\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/output\r\n3. Put pcap data in `/apps/metron/pcap/input`\r\n4. Run a fixed pcap query to generate results:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"endTimeMs\": 1458240269424,\r\n  \"startTimeMs\": 1458240269419\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\n5. Monitor the job with the get status endpoint until the job has SUCCEEDED and returns a pageTotal:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"jobId\": \"job_1532012905403_0001\",\r\n  \"jobStatus\": \"SUCCEEDED\",\r\n  \"description\": \"map: 20.0%, reduce: 0.0%\",\r\n  \"percentComplete\": 100,\r\n  \"pageTotal\": 2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n6. Download a file for a job and page number:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/octet-stream' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/job_1532012905403_0001/raw?page=1'\r\n```\r\nThis should download a file named `pcap_job_1532012905403_0001_1.pcap' to your local file system (job id will match yours).\r\n\r\n7. Download a file for a job and page number with a custom file name `pcap1.pcap`:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/octet-stream' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/job_1532012905403_0001/raw?page=1&fileName=pcap1.pcap'\r\n```\r\nThis should download a file named `pcap1.pcap`.\r\n\r\n8. Attempt to download a file for a job or page number that doesn't exist.  You should get a 404.\r\n\r\nI also verified that the file sizes of the files downloaded and the results in HDFS match.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is a subtask of the PCAP feature branch that adds pagination functionality to the PCAP search results. Unit tests are in place.\r\n\r\nYou can test by submitting a PCAP query and paging through the results. \r\n\r\n![pcap-paging](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/43132105-04234caa-8f3b-11e8-823f-0df76b075554.gif)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev. In order to test:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev.\r\n1. Put pcap data inside of `/apps/metron/pcap/input` in your VM.\r\n1. Start metron-alerts.\r\n1. Sign in and click on the PCAP tab in the upper left hand corner of the screen.\r\n1. Submit a pcap search which will return a set of results from your loaded pcap data, preferably on that will match at least a few dozen results.\r\n1. Page through the results. The lines should update with the next/previous packets. When you download a file, the results should match the current page shown in the UI.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a REST endpoint that returns pcap query results for the specified page in [PDML](https://wiki.wireshark.org/PDML) format (serialized as json instead of xml).  This will allow us to display pcap information in the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\nA new getPdml method was added to the PcapService.  This function gets a HDFS input stream given a path that's looked up by username, job id and page number.  A Java Process object calls out to a `pcap_to_pdml.sh` script that wraps a simple tshark command.  The HDFS inputs stream is connected to standard in of the script and PDML results are read from the process output stream.  Jackson is then used to convert the output xml to json and returned.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- A new PDML endpoint that accepts a job id and page number and returns PDML json for that page\r\n- A new PcapService getPath method that returns an HDFS path given a username, job id and page number\r\n- A new PcapService method described above\r\n- Annotated Jackson Javabean classes for transforming PDML xml to json\r\n- A `pcap_to_pdml.sh` script that wraps a simple tshark command and can be extended as needed\r\n- A new script path Spring property that can be changed to point to a different script location\r\n- Unit and integration tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Testing instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev\r\n2. Create the HDFS directories specified in application.yml\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/input\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/interim\r\n  - /apps/metron/pcap/output\r\n3. Put pcap data in `/apps/metron/pcap/input`\r\n4. Run a fixed pcap query to generate results:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"endTimeMs\": 1458240269424,\r\n  \"startTimeMs\": 1458240269419\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\n5. Monitor the job with the get status endpoint until the job has SUCCEEDED and returns a pageTotal:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"jobId\": \"job_1532012905403_0001\",\r\n  \"jobStatus\": \"SUCCEEDED\",\r\n  \"description\": \"map: 20.0%, reduce: 0.0%\",\r\n  \"percentComplete\": 100,\r\n  \"pageTotal\": 2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n6. Attempt to get PDML results using the job id and page number:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/job_1532012905403_0001/pdml?page=1'\r\n```\r\nYou should get an error message that clearly states wireshark is missing:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"responseCode\": 500,\r\n  \"message\": \"/usr/metron/0.5.1/bin/pcap_to_pdml.sh: line 19: tshark: command not found\\n\",\r\n  \"fullMessage\": \"RestException: /usr/metron/0.5.1/bin/pcap_to_pdml.sh: line 19: tshark: command not found\\n\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n7.  Install wireshark in full dev with `yum -y install wireshark`.  This time PDML should be returned:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0\",\r\n  \"creator\": \"wireshark/1.8.10\",\r\n  \"time\": \"Thu Jul 19 16:47:41 2018\",\r\n  \"captureFile\": \"\",\r\n  \"packets\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"protos\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"geninfo\",\r\n          \"pos\": \"0\",\r\n          \"showname\": \"General information\",\r\n          \"size\": \"130\",\r\n          \"hide\": null,\r\n          \"fields\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"name\": \"num\",\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n8.  Attempting to get PDML results for pages that don't exist (outside of the pageTotal) should return a 404.\r\n\r\nI'm still working on adding some documentation to the script and endpoint.  Otherwise this PR is ready for review.  Expect another doc commit shortly.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

should appear as the first two elements of the filter bar\r\n- Time selectors should have default values (end time: now, start time: now - 5 days)\r\n- Due to these fields are mandatory, the user should not be able to set time selectors to an invalid state (eg. missing value, null value or any value other than time)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nRemoving the login screens and modules from the UIs since they are superfluous in the the SSO context, and no-longer have an authentication engine to back them. \r\n\r\nThis can be tested by authentication with basic auth against the new hosts in METRON-1665 and then ensuring the UIs still function, and by ensuring the UIs do not redirect to a login. \r\n\r\nThe authentication will be handled by the hosts that allow loading of the UIs redirecting the browser to a KnoxSSO endpoint, handled in METRON-1665.\r\n\r\nNote, handling jwt cookie expiry is not included here, but will be left as a follow on task with separate ticketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer

is part of a move towards using KnoxSSO, and LDAP as an authentication method for Metron UIs.\r\n\r\nThe current UIs are served up by very lightweight nodejs applications, which serve the static bundle files produced by the angular build process, and proxies the rest api. This PR replaces this with Spring Boot applications, using the Spring Security stack. \r\n\r\nIt also provides a shared project used as the base for the UI host application, which ensures consistent security across all UIs (metron-interface/metron-ui-security) an abstract web hosting application with zuul embedded for proxying rest to avoid cors problems (metron-interface/metron-ui-host) and two further concrete applications to do the actual hosting, the angular front-ends have been subtley changed to package themselves in jars which are included in the hosting applications, aiding the ease and integrity of the front end code on deployment. \r\n\r\nSome tests in the rest api have been changed slightly, and a fix has been applied to AlertsUiController to allow users access to delete their own settings. The metron-rest project has also been adapted to work with metron-ui-security, and so inherits the same authentication benefits. \r\n\r\nA follow on PR will address changes to the mpack to implement necessary config changes.\r\n\r\nNodejs has been removed from the RPMs, and the deployment process, since it is no longer needed beyond the build stage. \r\n\r\nAn additional feature is the filter provided to allow JWT cookies to be passed to a backend through zuul as Authorization Bearer headers, allowing simpler stateless interaction with the rest api for example, which opens the possibility of deploying each layer in a load balanced or HA mode using ribbon config. \r\n\r\nTo test at this stage, you will need to manually configure and launch the metron-alerts and metron-config jars, which behave like init.d scripts. This can be done by launching the jars through the bin/ scripts, but would be a lot easier with the follow on work on mpack elements to configure them. For now, integration tests have been included for key function on the security layer and should be reviewed.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is built on top of https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1108 and should be merged and final review done after that is accepted into the feature branch.  This exposes the job manager and job status abstraction through a REST endpoint.\r\n\r\nA summary of the changes included:\r\n\r\n- Adjustments to the existing PcapService to accommodate the new JobManager abstraction\r\n  - JobManager is now a Spring bean and job submission/status is done through that\r\n  - New properties were added to application.yml and PcapServiceImpl\r\n  - PcapJobSupplier was added that allows switching to a mock pcap job during integration testing\r\n  - Unit and integration tests were adjusted to match\r\n  - Time parameters are now `startTimeMs` and `endTimeMs`\r\n- FixedPcapRequest now matches the pattern used in PcapRequest\r\n- Addition of a PcapStatus object to return status in a simple, consumable structure for the UI\r\n- Endpoint to get job status was added\r\n- ConfigOption was adjusted to automatically handle type conversions in cases where Jackson deserialization is used (Integer to Long for example)\r\n- InMemoryJobManager now throws a JobNotFoundException when jobs don't exist for a username/job id combination\r\n- PcapJob will automatically convert PcapOptions.START_TIME_MS to PcapOptions.START_TIME_NS when START_TIME_NS is not set (same goes for END_TIME_NS)\r\n- New unit and integration tests added for get status endpoint and service\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  The HDFS paths must be created manually for the paths specified in application.yml:\r\n- /apps/metron/pcap/input\r\n- /apps/metron/pcap/interim\r\n- /apps/metron/pcap/output\r\n\r\nTo test in full dev, create the HDFS directories mentioned above and put pcap data in `/apps/metron/pcap/input`.  Submit a fixed pcap query:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"endTimeMs\": 1458240269424,\r\n  \"startTimeMs\": 1458240269419\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\nA job id should be returned in the response:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"jobId\": \"job_1531258337010_0021\",\r\n  \"jobStatus\": \"RUNNING\",\r\n  \"description\": \"map: 0.0%, reduce: 0.0%\",\r\n  \"percentComplete\": 0,\r\n  \"size\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\nJob status can now be retrieved using the get job status endpoint:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/job_1531258337010_0021'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck the job status with this endpoint for the next minute or so.  The `percentComplete` field in the response should increase over time:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"jobId\": \"job_1531258337010_0021\",\r\n  \"jobStatus\": \"RUNNING\",\r\n  \"description\": \"map: 20.0%, reduce: 0.0%\",\r\n  \"percentComplete\": 10,\r\n  \"size\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `jobStatus` field should transition from RUNNING > FINALIZING > SUCCEEDED.  Once the job is in the SUCCEEDED state, the results should be available in HDFS.  The result path will follow this pattern:\r\n```\r\n/apps/metron/pcap/output/{user}/{jobType}/{jobId}/page-*\r\n```\r\nDepending on the page size, the output should look something like:\r\n```\r\nFound 2 items\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 metron metron       2236 2018-07-15 16:51 /apps/metron/pcap/output/user/MAP_REDUCE/job_1531258337010_0021/page-1\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 metron metron       1388 2018-07-15 16:51 /apps/metron/pcap/output/user/MAP_REDUCE/job_1531258337010_0021/page-2\r\n```\r\n\r\nA full, comprehensive review should be done after https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1108 has been merged.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1614\r\n\r\n### DO NOT MERGE until follow-on PR created/reviewed/+1'ed\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1109 branched from this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR requires a separate PR that will round out the failing/final bits in the REST endpoints - the build will be broken in this PR because the follow-up will fix the rest layer and accompanying tests. Once that PR is created, all testing should be done via that branch for e2e testing via the REST app and pcap cli. This branch/PR is provided as a subset of the final deliverable in this feature branch in order to make review and attribution easier.\r\n\r\nThe main thrust in this PR is to provide a `metron-job` module that contains a job manager abstraction for interacting with `Statusable<T>` jobs. The scope in this round is limited to making the `PcapJob` a `Statusable<Path>` that will enable asynchronous calls for managing the underlying MR job as well as for the finalization routine. \r\n\r\nA `TimerTask` is kicked off in the `PcapJob` for finalizing the results from the MR job when it completes successfully. As we expand the feature set to include other job types, e.g. Spark, the thread/timer management should be refactored into the `JobManager` implementation, but we'll have a better sense of what those api changes should look like once we start to add those new job types.\r\n\r\nThis version will not reload jobs upon restarting the REST api as the UI will only deal with the current query for a logged in user. PCAP MR job detail will be contained in the output paths that are configured via the REST application or PCAP CLI application.  The CLI job will continue to write to the local FS runtime exec directory while the REST app will write its final raw PCAP output to HDFS.\r\n\r\nAlso per the mailing list, this PR completely removes the existing `metron-api` module, which was the existing REST server wrapping the pcap query functionality. This is now deprecated/removed in favor of an implementation being added to the newer REST api in `metron-interface/metron-rest.`\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nJavadoc blew up when we run `mvn javadoc:javadoc`. Now it should complete successfully. Although with a ton of warnings. To test just `mvn javadoc:javadoc` from the root dir.\r\n\r\nIf we're good with the build matrix from https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1106, I propose we add the javadoc to the build as part of this PR, in order to avoid this in the future.\r\n\r\nI didn't alter `-Xdoclint:none` in the pom, because we use the multiline string lib and it'll blow up.

Contributor Comments\r\nCouple things happen here:\r\n\r\n- Added a mvn test goal for the metron-alert UI tests\r\n- Made the tests use Chrome headless in order to actually have them run properly in Travis. Also added the Chrome add-on in Travis for this.\r\n- Updated node/npm versions to fix some issues with running the tests.  Matched the version to https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1096\r\n- The build started going over time, so I resurrected the build matrix from https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/854. I left out the Maven wrapper stuff.  Given that Apache's been pretty good with Travis and other projects use this capability, I'm in favor of using it now that we're cramming even more in.\r\n\r\n### Build Matrix\r\nAs stated, a build matrix was added to the Travis build.  It breaks things into 4 sections the same as the PR it's based on.\r\n\r\n1. Unit Tests\r\n2. Integration Tests\r\n3. UI tests\r\n4. License validation\r\n\r\nJavadoc is skipped, because it's broken (sigh).  I have the fixes in a branch, and I'd like to turn it on as follow-on.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nMake sure that `mvn test` works from metron-interface/metron-alerts.  It should not spin up an actual Chrome window and should be headless.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to push into Travis, you should see something the following in the output. This can be seen at https://travis-ci.org/justinleet/metron/jobs/404500911. The overall build matrix job can be seen at https://travis-ci.org/justinleet/metron/builds/404500908.\r\n```\r\n[INFO] > metron-alerts@0.5.1 test /home/travis/build/justinleet/metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts\r\n[INFO] > karma start --single-run --browsers ChromeHeadless karma.conf.js\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] 16 07 2018 16:01:20.477:INFO [karma]: Karma v1.4.1 server started at http://0.0.0.0:9876/\r\n[INFO] 16 07 2018 16:01:20.480:INFO [launcher]: Launching browser ChromeHeadless with unlimited concurrency\r\n[INFO] 16 07 2018 16:01:20.492:INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome\r\n[INFO] 16 07 2018 16:01:44.456:INFO [HeadlessChrome 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0)]: Connected on socket Ts9_772t05A32OhrAAAA with id 78239511\r\n[INFO] HeadlessChrome 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 0 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 1 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.205 secs)\r\n[INFO] 16 07 2018 16:01:48.411:WARN [web-server]: 404: /api/v1/global/config\r\n[INFO] 16 07 2018 16:01:48.418:WARN [web-server]: 404: /api/v1/global/config\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 2 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.41 secs)\r\n[INFO] 16 07 2018 16:01:48.611:WARN [web-server]: 404: /api/v1/global/config\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 3 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.581 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 4 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.738 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 5 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.783 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 6 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.853 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 7 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.884 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 8 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.911 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 9 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.936 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 10 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.952 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 11 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.003 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 12 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.039 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 13 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.04 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 14 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.04 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 15 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.073 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 16 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.074 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 17 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.075 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 18 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.1 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 19 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.101 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 20 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.101 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 21 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.101 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 22 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.126 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 23 of 23 SUCCESS (0 secs / 1.214 secs)\r\n[INFO] e 0.0.0 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 23 of 23 SUCCESS (1.249 secs / 1.214 secs)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR contains the initial cut of PCAP UI.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2029\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-16 at 9 29 49 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/42747095-28d510bc-88db-11e8-8501-98c82f6ec521.png\">\r\n\r\nThe user is able to submit a PCAP process job by the search button (magnifier icon) at the top of the page. In the same filter bar User is able to narrow the result set by filtering to the following fields:\r\n\r\n  - IP Source Address\r\n  - IP Source Port\r\n  - IP Dest Address\r\n  - IP Dest Port\r\n  - Protocol\r\n  - Include Reverse Traffic\r\n  - Free text filtering\r\n\r\nWhile the PCAP job is in progress a progress bar shows up below the filter bar. (Sorry, having no screenshot about it.)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2028\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-16 at 9 30 43 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/42747099-2cbd9db6-88db-11e8-8be8-7f2bb2971fe3.png\">\r\n\r\nThe result of the PCAP processing is visualized in a grid. User able to open each record to get access to the details of the packet.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Running tests\r\nIf you like to run the unit tests run:\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm test\r\n\r\nFor addition info please check the readme.md in metron-alerts.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev. In order to test:\r\n1. Spin up full dev.\r\n2. Put pcap data inside of `/apps/metron/pcap/input` in your VM.\r\n3. Start metron-alerts.\r\n4. Sign in and click on the PCAP tab in the upper left hand corner of the screen.\r\n5. Submit a pcap search which will return a set of results from your loaded pcap data, preferably on that will match at least a few dozen results.\r\n\r\nFor test scenarios please check https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1671\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nUpdated the metaalert schema to properly use a dynamic field for threat triage scores, consistent with other schemas.  The one caveat is that metaalerts uses a Double (consistent with how it calculates scores under the hood).  This does not break sorting.\r\n\r\nTo test, spin up in full dev.  Go to the alert UI.  Sort by Score.\r\n\r\nNow create a metaalert (select a couple groups, click the link icon on the right of the group).  Navigate back to the main page.  The metaalert will likely have the highest score (as it uses sum of child alerts).  Sort by Score again and make sure the sorting changes appropriately.\r\n\r\nSort Ascending:\r\n<img width=\"1468\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-10 at 1 19 16 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5077341/42526466-e197fb60-8443-11e8-80ec-2011adf1d34c.png\">\r\n\r\nSort Descending:\r\n<img width=\"1467\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-10 at 1 19 23 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5077341/42526468-e2c095c4-8443-11e8-9c57-15deccca6337.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis upgrades bro to 2.5.4.  The changes are all security or bugfix related and shouldn't impact anything in the way of Metron configs.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\nvagrant --ansible-skip-tags='' up\r\nvagrant ssh\r\nsudo su -\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bro/bin\r\nif [[ \"$(bro -v)\" == \"bro version 2.5.4\" ]]; then echo 'Success!'; else echo 'ERROR:  Not running bro 2.5.4'; fi\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could also take a look at the testing steps in apache/metron#844 if you want to do some more thorough validation.\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n**Bro 2.5.3**\r\n- Security fixes\r\n  - Bro 2.5.3 fixes a security issue in Binpac generated code. In some cases the code generated by binpac could lead to an integer overflow which can lead to out of bound reads and allow a remote attacker to crash Bro; there is also a possibility that this can be exploited in other ways.\r\n\r\n**Bro 2.5.4**\r\n- Security fixes\r\n  - Multiple fixes and improvements to BinPAC generated code related to array parsing, with potential impact to all Bro’s BinPAC-generated analyzers in the form of buffer over-reads or other invalid memory accesses depending on whether a particular analyzer incorrectly assumed that the evaulated-array-length expression is actually the number of elements that were parsed out from the input.\r\n  - The NCP analyzer (not enabled by default and also updated to actually work with newer Bro APIs in the release) performed a memory allocation based directly on a field in the input packet and using signed integer storage. This could result in a signed integer overflow and memory allocations of negative or very large size, leading to a crash or memory exhaustion. The new NCP::max_frame_size tuning option now limits the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated.\r\n- Bug fixes\r\n  - A memory leak in the SMBv1 analyzer.\r\n  - The MySQL analyzer was generally not working as intended, for example, it now is able to parse responses that contain multiple results/rows.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR allows for users to specify multiple parsers to be run in one aggregated Storm topology.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the ParserBolt (and the supporting infrastructure) has been generalized to take multiple sensors.  This gives us a structure where there's a Storm spout per sensor.  These all lead to a parser bolt that delegates based on the topic metadata and output appropriately.\r\n\r\n### Current assumptions/restrictions\r\n\r\n- Topic metadata must be enabled in order to be able to delegate properly in the aggregated case (still unneeded for standard case).\r\n- Configs that are shared across parsers generally apply in a \"Last-one wins\" manner.  Theres's a couple minor exceptions (e.g. if a parser says Kafka security is not PLAINTEXT, that'll win over anyone who says PLAINTEXT).\r\n- All error topics for the aggregated parsers are the same.  This restriction could be lifted if we generalize that infrastructure a bit, but I think it's reasonable to leave as a follow-on if there's enough demand.\r\n- Order matters in how the sensors are specified.  \"bro,yaf\" is not the same as \"yaf,bro\".  There are two places this matters, configs and the name of the Storm topology. This could pretty easily be lifted by sorting for the Storm topology (and I might just go ahead and do it anyway).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo ensure that single sensor parsers work, just spin up full dev and ensure everything is passing data as expected.\r\n\r\nOn fulldev, the REST API has been altered to accept a comma separated list in the parser start and parser stop endpoints.  Just kill bro, and start up \"bro,yaf\".  An aggregated parser should be be launched in Storm with the names of both sensors used, and data should flow through both.   Because no UI is attached to aggregated parsers, I chose not to expand this REST API out for now until we know what's actually needed to properly manage it. The upshot of this is that you can't specify advanced configs directly here.\r\n\r\nOn the CLI, the start_parser_topology.sh can be used to submit\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\n${METRON_HOME}/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -z node1:2181 -s bro,yaf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to override certain parameters via command line this is still possible:\r\n```\r\n${METRON_HOME}/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -z node1:2181 -s bro,yaf -snt 2,3 -pp 2 -pnt 5\r\n```\r\nThis will spin up a topology with a spout number of tasks of 2 for bro, 3 for yaf, along with a parser parallelism of 2 and a parser number of tasks of 5.  This can be seen in the Storm UI by looking at the number of executors and tasks for each Storm component after launch.  As a heads up, because this is full dev and it's only running with one Storm supervisor/worker/etc, it's likely to be unhappy with the config, but it'll still submit the job.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Turn on the \"rich\" view so that we can compare offsets.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %define stellar.kafka.message.view := \"rich\"\r\n    rich\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Take a look at the function docs.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> ?KAFKA_SEEK\r\n    KAFKA_SEEK\r\n    Description: Seeks to an offset within a topic and returns the message.\r\n\r\n    Arguments:\r\n    \ttopic - The name of the Kafka topic\r\n    \tpartition - The partition identifier; starts at 0.\r\n    \toffset - The offset within the partition; starts at 0.\r\n    \tconfig - Optional map of key/values that override any global properties.\r\n\r\n    Returns: The message at the given offset, if the offset exists. Otherwise, returns null.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Get a message using `KAFKA_GET`.   Notice that this message is on partition=0 at offset=22022. \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_GET(\"indexing\")\r\n    [{partition=0, offset=22022, topic=indexing, value={\"adapter.threatinteladapter.end.ts\":\"1530982362426\",\"bro_timestamp\":\"1530982357.858518\",\"status_code\":200,\"ip_dst_port\":80,\"enrichmentsplitterbolt.splitter.end.ts\":\"1530982362416\",\"enrichments.geo.ip_dst_addr.city\":\"Strasbourg\",\"enrichments.geo.ip_dst_addr.latitude\":\"48.5839\",\"enrichmentsplitterbolt.splitter.begin.ts\":\"1530982362415\",\"adapter.hostfromjsonlistadapter.end.ts\":\"1530982362418\",\"enrichments.geo.ip_dst_addr.country\":\"FR\",\"enrichments.geo.ip_dst_addr.locID\":\"2973783\",\"adapter.geoadapter.begin.ts\":\"1530982362418\",\"enrichments.geo.ip_dst_addr.postalCode\":\"67100\",\"uid\":\"CKF1qF1rGnRihXjk84\",\"resp_mime_types\":[\"application\\/x-dosexec\"],\"trans_depth\":1,\"protocol\":\"http\",\"original_string\":\"HTTP | id.orig_p:49189 status_code:200 method:GET request_body_len:0 id.resp_p:80 uri:\\/?b514ee6f0fe486009a6d83b035a4c0bd tags:[] uid:CKF1qF1rGnRihXjk84 resp_mime_types:[\\\"application\\\\\\/x-dosexec\\\"] trans_depth:1 host:62.75.195.236 status_msg:OK id.orig_h:192.168.138.158 response_body_len:221184 user_agent:Mozilla\\/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident\\/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0) ts:1530982357.858518 id.resp_h:62.75.195.236 resp_fuids:[\\\"FuXzMl1eXRxp2UBgvk\\\"]\",\"ip_dst_addr\":\"62.75.195.236\",\"threatinteljoinbolt.joiner.ts\":\"1530982362429\",\"host\":\"62.75.195.236\",\"enrichmentjoinbolt.joiner.ts\":\"1530982362421\",\"adapter.hostfromjsonlistadapter.begin.ts\":\"1530982362418\",\"threatintelsplitterbolt.splitter.begin.ts\":\"1530982362423\",\"enrichments.geo.ip_dst_addr.longitude\":\"7.7455\",\"ip_src_addr\":\"192.168.138.158\",\"user_agent\":\"Mozilla\\/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident\\/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)\",\"resp_fuids\":[\"FuXzMl1eXRxp2UBgvk\"],\"timestamp\":1530982357858,\"method\":\"GET\",\"request_body_len\":0,\"uri\":\"\\/?b514ee6f0fe486009a6d83b035a4c0bd\",\"tags\":[],\"source.type\":\"bro\",\"adapter.geoadapter.end.ts\":\"1530982362418\",\"threatintelsplitterbolt.splitter.end.ts\":\"1530982362423\",\"adapter.threatinteladapter.begin.ts\":\"1530982362426\",\"ip_src_port\":49189,\"enrichments.geo.ip_dst_addr.location_point\":\"48.5839,7.7455\",\"status_msg\":\"OK\",\"guid\":\"bd3d53ff-2c6d-4b43-9f82-9846f9814f63\",\"response_body_len\":221184}, key=null, timestamp=1530982362434}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR updates the Alerts UI to use the latest stable release of Angular (6.1.3). [The original ticket in the ASF JIRA](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1476) was vague and probably originally intended to update both the Alerts and Management UI. However,[ I created a separate ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1749) for the Management UI to make the review process easier. \r\n\r\n### Changes included:\r\n* Updated .gitignore to more closely match that generated by Angular CLI and include common files, such as system and IDE specific files.\r\n* Added an .nvmrc to metron-alerts to help ensure developers are using the correct node version.\r\n* Updated documentation to recommend using a node version manager.\r\n* Renamed angular-cli to angular.json and updated the contents to work with the updated Angular CLI.\r\n* Updated prepend_license_header.sh to include css files.\r\n* Updated from using HttpModule and the Http service to HttpClientModule and the HttpClient service.\r\n* Updated from using RequestOptions to HttpHeaders.\r\n* Added an HttpInterceptor to set default headers in requests.\r\n* Added global-shim.ts to prevent polyfill.ts from hoisting and executing before initialization. See here for more details: [https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-dnd/issues/81]( https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-dnd/issues/81).\r\n* Updated Angular CLI flags to use double dashes (--).\r\n* Added aot compilation flag to serve script.\r\n* Removed and updated deprecated RxJS 6 features using [rxjs-tslint auto update rules](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs-tslint).\r\n* Updated auth service to use ReplaySubject instead of EventEmitter.\r\n* Created separate unit test scripts for Travis CI and local usage to prevent launching of two browsers.\r\n* Updated pom.xml to utilize `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.\r\n* Updated installed npm version to 6.2.0 (which allowed us to use `npm ci` instead of `npm install`).\r\n* Updated metron.spec to account for new Angular dist css file naming convention to prevent failures during a build.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a couple minor issues so that pcap jobs can be run in REST when Kerberos is enabled.  There were a couple missing maven dependencies that were causing Kerberos authentication warnings in the REST logs.  I also added a yarn setting to the full dev Ambari blueprint to resolve this error:\r\n```\r\nRequested user is not whitelisted and has id 501, which is below the minimum allowed 1000\r\n```\r\nThis shouldn't happen outside of full dev and will help others avoid it in the future.\r\n\r\nI tested this in full dev by running a fixed pcap query after enabling Kerberos.  The query should work without issue.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nStellar exceptions can be extremely nested and we should make efforts to separate the nested exception better.  What happens now is sometimes the exception gets cut off.\r\n\r\nThis one should be able to be tested in the REPL.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nI have been looking through the project source code, and found that the packaging docker containers are bigger than they need to be. \r\n\r\nThe containers' size could be cut substantially by:\r\n\r\n* Grouping as many commands as possible into as few RUN stages as possible\r\n* Taking advantage of `yum clean` and `apt-get clean`\r\n* Removing artifacts pulled with `wget`\r\n* Removing unused libraries or libraries only needed at build time (like `tar` and `wget`)\r\n\r\nIn local testing, I found the following reductions in container size:\r\n\r\n`deb`: 700MB --> 672MB\r\n`rpm`: 1GB --> 566MB\r\n`ansible`: 2.48GB --> 1.21GB\r\n\r\nTo test these changes, run the following on current master from the repo root:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMETRON=$(pwd)\r\nfor pkgtype in ansible deb rpm; do\r\n    cd ${METRON}/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/${pkgtype}-docker/\r\n    docker build -t ${pkgtype}_orig -f Dockerfile .\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run again on the PR branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMETRON=$(pwd)\r\nfor pkgtype in ansible deb rpm; do\r\n    cd ${METRON}/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/${pkgtype}-docker/\r\n    docker build -t ${pkgtype}_pr -f Dockerfile .\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then use `docker images` to compare the size of the original images to those generated by the Dockerfiles in this PR.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this change!\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [y] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

The test forces a flush of expired profiles and validates that a value was emitted from the expired profile.  During normal execution, any expired profiles are flushed regularly on a separate thread.\r\n\r\nThe test case can fail intermittently because profiles are also being flushed in a separate thread at the same time that the test case is forcing a flush.  When the test fails, both the flush triggered by the test and the flush triggered by the background thread have occurred, which results in two values being emitted and the test failing.\r\n\r\nInstead of scheduling the background thread so that it executes immediately, execution is delayed by the profile TTL.  There is no need to run the flush immediately as there will never be any expired profiles to flush at least until after a period of time equal to the TTL has passed.  Introducing this initial delay also gives the test plenty of time to execute without interference.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

sensor-stubs do not work in a kerberized development environment.  This makes it difficult to test issues related to kerberization.  Enhancing sensor-stubs to work in a kerberized environment will make testing in the development environment under kerberization much simpler.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up a development environment.\r\n1. Ensure that alerts are visible in the Alerts UI for both Bro and YAF.\r\n1. Kerberize the environment.\r\n1. Restart the sensor-stubs service.\r\n    ```\r\n    service sensor-stubs restart\r\n    ```\r\n1. Ensure that new alerts are visible in the Alerts UI for both Bro and YAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently we have only one layer of parsing prior to enrichment, but often real data is more complex.  For instance, often data is wrapped in an envelope (e.g. syslog data which contains a field which needs to be parsed).\r\n\r\nThis Jira allows us to support a DAG of parsers prior to enrichment by allowing us to provide a strategy for interpreting what is data and what is metadata in the parser bolt.  This enables upstream parsers to pass in a JSON Blob which contains the metadata and have the parser bolt choose which field is the data to be parsed, the remaining fields would be considered metadata (and merged into the resulting data or not depending on our existing rules for handling metadata).\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this better, I've provided a use-case with an example.  Note, this PR depends on METRON-1643 and METRON-1642, so those should be reviewed prior to this.\r\n\r\nManual Test script:\r\n* Go through the use-case doc.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nA relatively common pattern is to choose the value of a field based on if another field matches a set of regexes.  This can be done via stellar with match, but if the list of possible regexes are large, that can be unwieldy.  To ease that burden, we should have a REGEX_ROUTING field transformation.\r\n\r\n## Manual Test Script\r\nEnsure that `ZOOKEEPER`, `BROKERLIST` and `METRON_HOME` are set.\r\n* Create a `dummy` topic\r\n```\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper $ZOOKEEPER --create --topic dummy --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1\r\n```\r\n* Open $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/dummy.json and save\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\"\r\n  ,\"sensorTopic\" : \"dummy\"\r\n  , \"parserConfig\": {\r\n     \"columns\" : { \"name\": 0\r\n                 , \"first_field\": 1\r\n                 , \"timestamp\" : 2\r\n                 }\r\n   }\r\n  ,\"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n    {\r\n     \"transformation\" : \"REGEX_SELECT\"\r\n    ,\"input\" :  \"name\"\r\n    ,\"output\" :  \"is_metron\"\r\n    ,\"config\" : {\r\n      \"true\" : \"^metron.*\"\r\n                }\r\n    }\r\n                           ]\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n*  Push configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh --mode PUSH -z $ZOOKEEPER -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/`\r\n* Stop the parsers in ambari\r\n* Start the `dummy` parser\r\n```\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k $BROKERLIST -z $ZOOKEEPER -s dummy\r\n```\r\n* Open `~/data.json` and save:\r\n```\r\nnotmetron,f1,1\r\nmetron,f2,2\r\nmetron,f3,3\r\nmetron,f4,4\r\nmetron,f5,5\r\nmetron,f6,6\r\nmetron,f7,7\r\nnotmetroneither,f8,8\r\n```\r\n* Send data into the `dummy` topic via\r\n```\r\ncat data.json | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic dummy\r\n```\r\nYou should examine the `dummy` index in elasticsearch and ensure that messages with the `name` field of `metron` have a field called `is_metron` set to `true`.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
