We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met. If you have any questions how to fix your problem or about using Tika in general, please sign up for the [Tika mailing list](http://tika.apache.org/mail-lists.html).

We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.

If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.

We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.

We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-4097`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.

We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-4096`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-4096] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.

href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html\">Gradle Module Metadata</a></h4>\n<p>The Gradle team has contributed a metadata file for Guava. If you use Gradle 6 or higher, you will see better handling of two kinds of dependency conflicts, plus another small feature related to our dependencies:</p>\n<h5>Selecting the appropriate flavor</h5>\n<p>When Gradle automatically selects the newest version of Guava in your dependency graph, it will now also select the appropriate flavor (<code>-android</code> or <code>-jre</code>) based on whether you project targets Android or not. For example, if you depend on 32.1.0-android and 30.0-jre, Gradle will select 32.1.0-jre. This is the version most likely to be compatible with all your dependencies.</p>\n<p>In the unusual event that you need to override Gradle's choice of flavor, you can do so as follows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"kotlin\"><code>dependencies.constraints {\n  implementation(&quot;com.google.guava:guava&quot;) {\n    attributes {\n      attribute(\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
