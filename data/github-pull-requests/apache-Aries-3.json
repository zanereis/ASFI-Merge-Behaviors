https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARIES-2108.\r\n\r\nLoading ServiceProvider instances, which depend on classes absent at runtime (e.g. because they are contained in an optional dependency) throws a `NoClassDefFoundError` instead of a `ClassNotFoundException`,  which is propagated to the caller of `ProviderBundleTrackerCustomizer.addingBundle()` and leads to an empty list of providers. Instead a `NoClassDefFoundError` should be handled like a `ClassNotFoundException`.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this different exception in this case is that although the service class is found it cannot be defined.\r\n\r\nThe javadoc of `NoClassDefFoundError` states:\r\n```\r\nThrown if the Java Virtual Machine or a ClassLoader instance tries to load in the definition of a class\r\n(as part of a normal method call or as part of creating a new instance using the new expression)\r\nand no definition of the class could be found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe javadoc of `ClassNotFoundException` states:\r\n```\r\nThrown when an application tries to load in a class through its string name using:\r\n- The forName method in class Class.\r\n- The findSystemClass method in class ClassLoader .\r\n- The loadClass method in class ClassLoader.\r\nbut no definition for the class with the specified name could be found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne example where this scenario occurs is Logback for SLF4J-2. Besides the `SLF4JServiceProvider` service this bundle also provides a `ServletContainerInitializer`, which is only relevant/intended for server/web-app environments where an implementation of the `jakarta./javax.servlet` API is provided.\r\nTherefore the maven dependencies for `jakarta./javax.servlet` are in the provided scope and optional and correspondingly the `jakarta./javax.servlet` packages are only optionally imported in the `MANIFEST.MF`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/qos-ch/logback/blob/4e069d34d9422a43511ae7d6242a27caa8834e14/logback-classic/pom.xml#L335-L356","created_at":"2023-07-04T12:37:38Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T13:32:41Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T10:43:10Z","merged_at":"2023-09-29T10:43:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"09b2d7593e6dbd51b9b8735a7106781957f944e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/pulls/233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/pulls/233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/issues/233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/statuses/891b7318d7925f58303ff8314660085c74a6d2cf","head":{"label":"HannesWell:noClassDefFoundError","ref":"noClassDefFoundError","sha":"891b7318d7925f58303ff8314660085c74a6d2cf","user":{"login":"HannesWell","id":44067969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDY3OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44067969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell","html_url":"https://github.com/HannesWell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":662121325,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ3crbQ","name":"apache.aries","full_name":"HannesWell/apache.aries","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HannesWell","id":44067969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDY3OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44067969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell","html_url":"https://github.com/HannesWell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HannesWell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HannesWell/apache.aries","description":"Apache

now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<p>Note: this does not affect <code>mockito-android</code> nor testing on Android.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<p>Note: this does not affect <code>mockito-android</code> nor testing on Android.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<p>There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new <code>mockito-subclass</code> artifact (published <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass\">on Maven Central</a> along with all our other artifacts).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[mockito-core](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) from 4.9.0 to 5.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases\">mockito-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Mockito 5: prepare for future JDK versions</h1>\n<p>For a while now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<p>There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new <code>mockito-subclass</code> artifact (published <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass\">on Maven Central</a> along with all our other artifacts).</p>\n<h2>Update the minimum supported Java version to 11</h2>\n<p>Mockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.\nSimilar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.\nThe primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.\nLately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.\nAdditionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798\">issues with the <code>SecurityManager</code></a>.\nSince we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>What should I do if I still run JDK 8?</h3>\n<p>For JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.\nThis is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.\nThe changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.\nHowever, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.</p>\n<h2>New <code>type()</code> method on <code>ArgumentMatcher</code></h2>\n<p>One of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/ArgumentMatcher.html\"><code>ArgumentMatcher</code> interface</a>.\nThe interface allows you to define a custom matcher, which you can pass into method arguments to provide more targeted matches.\nOne major shortcoming of the <code>ArgumentMatcher</code> was the lack of varargs support.</p>\n<!-- raw

The implementation uses <code>java.util.spi.ToolProvider</code> introduced in Java 9, so if it is run on Java 7 or 8 the resulting archive will be identical to a one created by <code>JarArchiver</code> - the module descriptor is not going to be validated and no additional information (such as version, main class and packages) is going to be added.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/67\">#67</a> - Added ability to set the module version and main class of a modular JAR file</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/83\">#83</a> - Added new protected method (<code>postCreateArchive</code>) to <code>AbstractArchiver</code> that is called after the archive is created successfully</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/87\">#87</a> - of Levan Giguashvili (<a href=\"https://github.com/odinn1984\"><code>@​odinn1984</code></a>)  Snyk eng team to fix a possible security issue.

Now Plexus Archiver uses pure Java implementations to deal with file attributes so the <code>useJvmChmod</code> is no longer used and it is just ignored. <code>Archiver#setUseJvmChmod</code>, <code>Archiver#isUseJvmChmod()</code>, <code>UnArchiver#setUseJvmChmod</code>, <code>UnArchiver#isUseJvmChmod()</code>, <code>ArchiveEntryUtils#chmod( File, int, Logger, boolean )</code> and <code>ArchiveEntryUtils#chmod( File, int, Logger )</code> are deprecated and are subject to removal in a future version.</p>\n<h2>:rocket: New features and improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/51\">#51</a> - More specific exception for cases when there are no files to archive.

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/57\">#57</a> - Added Archiver implementation (<code>JarToolModularJarArchiver</code>) that creates modular JAR files using the JDK jar tool. The implementation uses <code>java.util.spi.ToolProvider</code> introduced in Java 9, so if it is run on Java 7 or 8 the resulting archive will be identical to a one created by <code>JarArchiver</code> - the module descriptor is not going to be validated and no additional information (such as version, main class and packages) is going to be added.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/67\">#67</a> - Added ability to set the module version and main class of a modular JAR file</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/83\">#83</a> - Added new protected method (<code>postCreateArchive</code>) to <code>AbstractArchiver</code> that is called after the archive is created successfully</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/87\">#87</a> - of Levan Giguashvili (<a href=\"https://github.com/odinn1984\"><code>@​odinn1984</code></a>)  Snyk eng team to fix a possible security issue.

Now Plexus Archiver uses pure Java implementations to deal with file attributes so the <code>useJvmChmod</code> is no longer used and it is just ignored. <code>Archiver#setUseJvmChmod</code>, <code>Archiver#isUseJvmChmod()</code>, <code>UnArchiver#setUseJvmChmod</code>, <code>UnArchiver#isUseJvmChmod()</code>, <code>ArchiveEntryUtils#chmod( File, int, Logger, boolean )</code> and <code>ArchiveEntryUtils#chmod( File, int, Logger )</code> are deprecated and are subject to removal in a future version.</p>\n<h2>:rocket: New features and improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/51\">#51</a> - More specific exception for cases when there are no files to archive.
