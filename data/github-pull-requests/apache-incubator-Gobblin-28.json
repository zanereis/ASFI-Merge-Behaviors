It has several unrelated changes in a single PR\n#### Major changes\n1. Major change is in `AccessControlAction` to not make unecessary `FileSystem` calls. With this change, `AccessControlAction` calls `fs.setPermission` and `fs.setOwner` if the permissions and owner of a path are different from what the user wants. To make this change I had to move around some code because the current `FileSystemDatasetVersion` does not know the `FileStatus` of a `DatasetVersion`. It only knows the `Path`.\n2. Currently `DatasetCleanerJob` only supports running retention on datasets that import a tag. The only way to run retention on multiple kinds of datasets  that import different tags is to have different jobs. I have added multi tag support in this pr. The same key `gobblin.retention.tag` is now a comma separated list of tags in the config store. (Internal ask from ops ETL-4855)\n#### Minor trivial changes\n1. Logging in retention was too verbose and useless. Moved some of them to debug. Added `@ToString` to all the version selection policies for more meaningful logs\n2. By default the hive based retention used to delete data as well. Looking at the use cases, it seems like the default should to not delete data. Changed it in `CleanableHiveDataset` and a few unit tests.\n3. Chagned the `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_DATASETS_CLEANED` to 100 from 1000. Since we have more actions like `AccessControl`, I expect more namenode calls. There is no need to stress the namenode because retention is not a time critical job.\n4. Added simulate mode for `AccessControlAction`\n\n@ydai1124 and @ibuenros  can you

PR implements distcp prioritization in two parts:\n\nCommit 1: Implements the request allocation interfaces and implementations. Suggested order of review:\n- Start with `RequestAllocator` interface, which has a description of the request allocation problem and model.\n- Look at the basic interfaces/classes `Request`, `Requestor`, `ResourceEstimator`, `ResourcePool`, `ResourceRequirement`.\n- Look at specific subclasses `PushDownRequestor`, `HierarchicalPrioritizer`, `SimpleHierarchicalPrioritizer`.\n- Look at `RequestAllocator` implementations: `AllEqualAllocator`, `BruteForceAllocator`, `HierarchicalAllocator`, `PreOrderAllocator`.\n- Look at unit tests for `RequestAllocator` implementations to get an idea on how to use them.\n- Look at supporting classes `ConcurrentBoundedPriorityIterable`, `VectorAlgebra`.\n\nCommit 2: uses request allocation to implement prioritization for distcp. Suggested order of review:\n- Start with `CopyResourcePool`, which specifies the resources used in distcp (total byte size and number of copy entities).\n- Look at changes in `FileSet` which now implements `Request` and is an interface, as well as `FileSetResourceEstimator`.\n- Look at `HiveFileSet`, `HivePartitionFileSet`, `HivePartitionsDeregisterFileSet`, and `UnpartitionedTableFileSet` which are implementations of `FileSet` for Hive distcp.\n- Look at `CopyableDatasetRequestor`, which wraps a `CopyableDatasetBase` to make it a `Requestor`, as well as `PrioritizedCopyableDataset`

control, encryption, deletion etc.\n2. `RetentionAction.RetentionActionFactory` the factory API for creating new retention actions. The factory has a `RetentionAction.RetentionActionFactory#canCreateWithConfig(config)` method which decides if the `config` object passed has all the required keys to create a new `RetentionAction`. If yes, `RetentionAction.RetentionActionFactory#createRetentionAction(config)` is called. This pattern allows adding new `RetentionAction`s easily. A `RetentionAction` can decide to use whatever config keys it wants which only its facory knows.\n3. `AccessControlAction` mostly business logic for setting permissions, user and group\n\n@ibuenros

Currently, the file system is constructed using default configuration (new Configuration()). Eventually, we should allow to inject other Hadoop configuration through the Config object.\n- Moved FSJobCatalogHelper.materializedJobSpec() to FSJobCatalog as this is the only place it was used and made the method non-static.\n- Moved FSJobCatalogHelper.JobSpecConverter to ImmutableFSJobCatalog as it is specific to that implementation.\n- Moved FSJobCatalogHelper.addPathAlterationObserver to

PR is a continuation of PR https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/pull/1196 .\n\nCurrently the `DatePartitionedDailyAvroSource` can only read daily partitioned data.\nThis PR extends this functionality by introducing `DatePartitionedAvroFileSource` in which the partitioning is configurable by the properties as follows:\n\n> date.partitioned.source.partition.prefix\n> date.partitioned.source.partition.suffix\n> date.partitioned.source.partition.pattern\n> date.partitioned.source.partition.granularity\n\nThis is the _reader equivalent_ of the time-based writer and partitioner, found in `TimeBasedWriterPartitioner` and `TimePartitionedDataPublisher`.\nWith this add-on new data sets can be read using different temporal granularity, not just as daily partitioned data.\n","created_at":"2016-09-11T23:06:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-26T20:03:27Z","closed_at":"2017-03-15T16:29:13Z","merged_at":"2017-03-15T16:29:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"1db30ae9b3fe6dd499aadb03431df27188dee8ac","assignee":{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":153127084,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTMxMjcwODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null},{"id":516489420,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MTY0ODk0MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/Source:FileSystem","name":"Source:FileSystem","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/60c440f9426578bc94b116fae90307b775f67fda","head":{"label":"lbendig:lbendig_partition_read","ref":"lbendig_partition_read","sha":"60c440f9426578bc94b116fae90307b775f67fda","user":{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":31592005,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU5MjAwNQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"lbendig/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}"

of this PR:\n- New converters: `GobblinMetricsFlattenerConverter` (flattens Metric report), `SchemaInjector` (injects a string schema to sources that can't provide a schema), `AvroToJsonStringConverter`, `JsonToStringConverter` (uses Gson to serialize json into string), `StringToBytesConverter` (using UTF8 encoding).\n- New/improved sources/extractors: `FixedSchemaKafkaAvroExtractor`: allows ingesting avro topics wiht a fixed schema when schema registry is not available, `SimpleKafkaSource`: single entry point to Kafka extractors.\n- `WikipediaSource` refactoring: previously Wikipedia source would simply pull the last 10 revisions over and over, which is not a good way of showing Gobblins capabilities. Modified it so it pulls revisions, remembers last revision pulled per article, and pushes new revisions each run.\n- Some fixes to `KafkaAvroReporter`.\n- Fixes to `JobScheduler` to improve standalone Gobblin execution: exit Gobblin correctly on failure of services, skip invalid pull files, etc.\n- Bug fixes to pull file change detector.\n- Updated templates and moved them to `gobblin-runtime`.\n","created_at":"2016-08-31T16:50:16Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T21:03:53Z","closed_at":"2016-09-02T21:03:51Z","merged_at":"2016-09-02T21:03:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad8b4be71ed6dcb7447f103536a590c900bf6330","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/452a03df7c022d9fc1ecb1908a22fe13ab06fcfb","head":{"label":"ibuenros:vldb","ref":"vldb","sha":"452a03df7c022d9fc1ecb1908a22fe13ab06fcfb","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33570608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3MDYwOA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"ibuenros/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://ap

`ServiceBasedAppLauncher` that logs failures of the services and shutdowns Gobblin on failure of a service.\nAlso separated the quartz scheduler as an independent service managed in the `ServiceManager`. This is necessary because otherwise, when `JobScheduler` fails, its `shutDown` method cannot be called, so the scheduler cannot be closed, causing the application to hang.

the change is relatively simple.\nSee https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/commit/a0ac0a39af26fe6fd15f05ae632ad4a0055c7812?w=1 to view the diff without

Changes\n\nFor every Table we create a NoOp watermark WorkUnit that stores watermarks for all its Partitions as a `Map`. This workunit is identified by the property `IS_WATERMARK_WORKUNIT_KEY` being set to `true`.\nThis workunit is intended to only carry watermark state and does not contain any business logic to execute hive conversion queries.\n\nThe watermark is stored as a `MultiKeyValueLongWatermark` which is an extension to `Map` that implements gobblin's `Watermark` interface. The key is a Partition identifier and value is the watermark for this Partition\n\nThe maximum number of Partition watermarks for each Table can be adjusted by the property MAX_PARTITIONS_IN_WATERMARK_PER_DATASET_KEY, The default is 50. This means we only track watermarks for 50 most recently modified partitions of each table. If a previous watermark is not found for as partition, it returns 0 as the watermark\n\nA `TableLevelWatermarer` is still supported. It can be used instead of a `PartitionLevelWatermarker`\n\nNote that the publish logic is still at a per `Table` level. We still fail all partitions if any partition fails. Per partition commit is doable but is an optimization we can work on later.\n\n@chavdar and @abti  can you review?\n\nInternal jira ticket - ETL-4785\n","created_at":"2016-08-16T02:45:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T19:00:10Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T19:00:10Z","merged_at":"2016-08-22T19:00:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"fdf39864e5b08586236a59d1c51a1cb2f11e6512","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1205/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1205/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1205/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/628d407f2eb7de7ab6103e1033ed40cf9ea6cca4","head":{"label":"pcadabam-zz:avroToOrc","ref":"avroToOrc","sha":"628d407f2eb7de7ab6103e1033ed40cf9ea6cca4","user":{"login":"pcadabam-zz","id":1166372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/pcadabam-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36956709,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjk1NjcwOQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"pcadabam-zz/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pcadabam-zz","id":1166372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/pcadabam-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pcadabam-zz/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/r

The solution is to change it to use `PropertiesConfiguration` object for loading a `inputStream` instead. \n- The instance of FileSystem will be closed with try-with-resources implementation, which is not expected for periodically running scenario.

PR implements a SLA event monitor which will generate JobSpecs from SLA events received in a Kafka topic.\n\nMain classes:\n- `KafkaAvroJobMonitor`: extends `KafkaJobMonitor`, parsing the events with a fixed avro schema.\n- `SLAEventKafkaJobMonitor`: extends `KafkaAvroJobMonitor` to parse SLA events. It uses an input template, and can apply name or dataset urn filters, as well as mapping certain metadata of the sla event into configurations for the Gobblin job.\n\nOther major changes:\n- Added metrics to `KafkaJobMonitor` and `HighLevelConsumer`.\n- Lots of tests.\n","created_at":"2016-08-11T23:24:51Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T20:31:02Z","closed_at":"2016-08-16T20:30:59Z","merged_at":"2016-08-16T20:30:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1ac28af2b7a535ac17837a9aee8dfb21bb11be5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/559d70720e79cac00598fc93450756f3699dc928","head":{"label":"ibuenros:slaeventmonitor","ref":"slaeventmonitor","sha":"559d70720e79cac00598fc93450756f3699dc928","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33570608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3MDYwOA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"ibuenros/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"

the `DatePartitionedDailyAvroSource` can only read _daily_ partitioned data.\nThis PR extends this functionality by introducing `DatePartitionedAvroFileSource` in which the partitioning is

this PR I'd like to add the capability of writing to Teradata.\n- Writing is done through batch inserts \n- The final table should be created beforehand which is ideally a _MULTISET_ table\n  _without a primary index_.\n- Writer specific jars (**tdgssconfig** and **terajdbc4**) need to be passed to the job \n\nExcerpt from a job definition:\n\n> # Converter\n> converter.classes=gobblin.converter.jdbc.AvroToJdbcEntryConverter\n> \n> # Writer\n> writer.destination.type=TERADATA\n> writer.builder.class=gobblin.writer.JdbcWriterBuilder\n> \n> # Publish\n> data.publisher.job.type=gobblin.publisher.JdbcPublisher\n> jdbc.publisher.url=jdbc:teradata://host\n> jdbc.publisher.driver=com.teradata.jdbc.TeraDriver\n\nTests:\nExport 30M records with and without staging tables to Teradata 15.10\nboth from HDFS and Kafka sources.\n\n---\n\nAdditional fix: class `resourcesBasedTemplate` was renamed to `ResourcesBasedTemplate` which caused Findbug checks to fail\n","created_at":"2016-08-04T21:37:39Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T19:57:18Z","closed_at":"2016-09-12T17:59:41Z","merged_at":"2016-09-12T17:59:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb085c66289eefa21a42257d605d263665878de6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/025f3590e51f54e204e9b5e28669a5a4580ada65","head":{"label":"swisscom-bigdata:pr_teradata_writer","ref":"pr_teradata_writer","sha":"025f3590e51f54e204e9b5e28669a5a4580ada65","user":{"login":"swisscom-bigdata","id":11226371,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExMjI2Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11226371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata","html_url":"https://github.com/swisscom-bigdata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54065664,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDA2NTY2NA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"swisscom-bigdata/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swisscom-bigdata","id":11226371,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExMjI2Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11226371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata","html_url":"https://github.com/swisscom-bigdata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swisscom-bigdata/gobblin","description":"Universal

to the new API:\n- Made GobblinInstanceLauncher extend configurable since it is responsible of holding the system configuration\n- Added initial version of JobExecutionDriver and modified JobExecutionLauncher to return JobExecutionDriver\n- Added a JobLauncherExecutionDriver which acts as an adapter to the legacy JobLauncher/JobLauncherFactory API\n- Reworked JobSpec.Builder to be convention-based and be able to reuse some of the properties in the Job configuration\n- Added StandardGobblinInstanceDriver and StandardGobblinInstanceLauncher-- a very rudimentary implementations of
