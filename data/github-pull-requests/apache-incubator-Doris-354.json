Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen Doris is in debug mode, function `Coordinator#traceInstance` is used to print the phsical execute plan of a fragment instance for debug. Function  `Coordinator#traceInstance` uses param `scanRangeAssignment` to print the detail of a fragment. But bucket shuffle join and colocate shuffle join do not fil the param. That will cause debug not work availablely.\r\nThis path fill assignment param of bucket shuffle and colocate shuffle for debug.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThreadSanitizer, aka TSAN, is a userful tool to detect multi-thread\r\nproblems, such as data race, mutex problems, etc.\r\nWe should detect TSAN problems for Doris BE, both unit tests and\r\nserver should pass through TSAN mode, to make Doris more robustness.\r\nThis is the very beginning patch to fix TSAN problems, and some\r\ndifficult problems are suppressed in file 'tsan_suppressions', you\r\ncan suppress these problems by setting:\r\nexport TSAN_OPTIONS=\"suppressions=tsan_suppressions\"\r\nbefore running:\r\nBUILD_TYPE=tsan ./run-be-ut.sh --run\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [] I have create an issue on (Fix #ISSUE), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [] If this change need a document change, I have updated the document\r\n- [] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nWe should fix all the TSAN problems.","created_at":"2020-12-28T07:27:58Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T01:45:12Z","closed_at":"2021-01-15T01:45:11Z","merged_at":"2021-01-15T01:45:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"58e58c94d81a4b4fafeb64617b822c98bb577e69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n**Bucket shuffle join** is a algorithm of joining two tables.  Left table is distrubuted by a column. Right table sends the data to the left table for joining operation. It reduces the network cost. But when two table is withou any data.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen query uses **bucket join**, fuction `Coordinator#BucketShuffleJoinController#getExecHostPortForFragmentIDAndBucketSeq` is responseful for making sure each host have average bucket to scan. That means if there are 10 buckets to scan and 5 hosts, the strategy will distributed 2 buckets to each host. The algorithm is like this:\r\n\r\na. use data structure `buckendIdToBucketCountMap` to represents how many buckets distributed to the backend；\r\nb. traverse every backend, find a backend which owns minimum buckets. We call it **mini_backend**;\r\nc. distribute the bucket to the  **mini_backend**; \r\nd. update  `buckendIdToBucketCountMap` for **mini_backend**;\r\n\r\nWhen all bakends are all alive, the algorithm is available. But when mini_backend is not alive, it will chose a replica host as final host randomly and `buckendIdToBucketCountMap` is not updated. This will cause the bucket scan task not load balance.\r\n\r\nThis patch optimize the algorithm. When the mini_backend is not alive, update `buckendIdToBucketCountMap`.\r\n\r\n**Related Issue**: #5132\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThere are some long loops and sleeps in unit tests, they will cost a\r\nvery long time to complete all unit tests, especially run in TSAN mode.\r\nThis patch speed up unit tests by shortening long loops and sleeps,\r\non my environment all unit tests duration reduced from about 30\r\nminutes to less than 1 minute. It's useful to do basic functional unit tests.\r\nYou can switch to run in this mode by adding a new environment variable\r\n'DORIS_ALLOW_SLOW_TESTS'. For example, you can enable it by setting:\r\nexport DORIS_ALLOW_SLOW_TESTS=1\r\nand also you can disable it by setting:\r\nexport DORIS_ALLOW_SLOW_TESTS=0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n#4996 \r\nWhen BE is restarting and the older tablet have been added to the garbage collection queue but not deleted yet.\r\nIn this case, since the data_dirs are parallel loaded, a later loaded tablet may be older than previously loaded one, which should not be acknowledged as a failure.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the `_add_tablet_unlocked()` method will also be called when creating a new tablet. In that case, the changes in this pull request will not be accessed so there is no affect on the tablet creating process.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen two cholocate tables make `join` operation, to make `join` operation locally, the tablet belongs to the same bucket sequence will be distributed to the same host. When chosing which host for a bucket sequence, it takes random strategy. Random strategy can not make query task load balance logically for one query. Therefore, this patch takes round-robin strategy, make buckets distributed evenly. For example, if there are 6 bucket sequences and 3 hosts, it is better to distributed 2 buket sequence for every host. \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nFor the task of rebalancing tablet among different disks on the same BE, It might be an effective strategy to ensure all tablets under the same partition evenly distribute on the different disks. Thus, it is necessary to obtain the distribution of tablets under the same partition between different disks on a BE.\r\n\r\nThis patch add a new http interface for BE to acquire the distribution of tablets under a partition between different disks on the same BE.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn the previous implementation, whether a subtask is in commit or abort state,\r\nwe will try to update the job progress, such as the consumed offset of kafka.\r\nUnder normal circumstances, the aborted transaction does not consume any data,\r\nand all progress is 0, so even we update the progress, the progress will remain\r\nunchanged.\r\nHowever, in the case of high cluster load, the subtask may fail half of the execution on the BE side.\r\nAt this time, although the task is aborted, part of the progress is updated.\r\nCause the next subtask to skip these data for consumption, resulting in data loss.\r\n\r\nBad case:\r\nLoadedRows = 0;\r\ncomittedOffset > 0\r\ntxn: aborted\r\n\r\nAlso modify some log level and config\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x]

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIntroduced by PR #5051.\r\nAs @liutang123 said, when PlanFragmentExecutor is destructed, it will call\r\n`close -> ExecNode::close -> OlapScanNode::close`. OlapScanNode will wait for `_transfer_thread`.\r\n`_transfer_thread` will wait for all OlapScanner processing to complete.\r\nOlapScanner is processed by the scanner thread. When the last scanner processing is completed,\r\n`_transfer_thread` will break out of the loop, and PlanFragmentExecutor will continue to destruct.\r\nAnd if it is completed, its RuntimeProfile::Counter will also be destructed.\r\nAt this time, the ScopedTimer in the Scan thread may still use this Counter when it is destructed.\r\n\r\nSo we must make sure that the timer is deconstructed before deconstructing the runtime profile.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrent partition cache mode does not support semi range query like `SELECT eventdate, COUNT(userid) FROM appevent WHERE eventdate>=\"2020-01-13\" GROUP BY eventdate`, only supports range query like `SELECT eventdate, COUNT(userid) FROM appevent WHERE eventdate>=\"2020-01-13\" and eventdate <= \"2020-01-18\"  GROUP BY eventdate`. This patch tries tor solve this probelm. When the operator of where clause is `>=` or `>`， we will find the upper bound of the partition, and rewrite the sql into `SELECT eventdate, COUNT(userid) FROM appevent WHERE eventdate>=\"2020-01-13\" and eventdate < upper_bound GROUP BY eventdate`. When the operator of where clause is `<=` or `<`， we will find the lower bound of the partition, and rewrite the sql into `SELECT eventdate, COUNT(userid) FROM appevent WHERE eventdate>= lower_bound and eventdate < \"2020-01-18\" GROUP BY eventdate`. \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDoris supports two kinds of cache mode: sql_cache and partition_cache. sql_cache takes sql string as key and cache the whole data. partition_cache splits the data into many partition data and caches them differently. Therefore a query may hit part of the partition_cache data. If a query hits the left part of the data, we call the hit range is left. If a query hits the right part of the data, we call the hit range is right. And if a query hits the whole part of the data, we call the hit range is full.\r\n\r\nA query does not hit any partition cache, but the algorithm still returns hit range right. It should return hit range none.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: #5136\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe follow table has 8 partitions and partition cache is enabled. Currently, Doris will chose a latest partition which will be taken as current partition and not be cached. The strategy is `partition.getVisibleVersionTime() > table.latestTime && partition.getVisibleVersion() > table.latestVersion`. When all paritions are the same versision, it wil chose a partition randomly, for example, it choses paritition 20201210 as the lastest partition. Therefore partition 20201210 will be cached.   A range query with partition between 20201209 and 20201211 will not hit cache 20201210.\r\nThis patch takes `VisibleVersionTime` as the first factor, if `VisibleVersionTime` are the same, choses partition with max versition\r\n![2020-12-10 14-40-39屏幕截图](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12771191/101730856-b8fe3c80-3af5-11eb-8e06-9a84439ae3ab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThere are two points that affect performance in the current json load:\r\n1 json is actually a traversal operation for searching by key. We call HasMember and operator[] twice, and need to traverse twice\r\n2 If you use a string as the key to find the json object, strlen will be called every time, so the number of calls to strlen is the row number * column number\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [] I have create an issue on (Fix #5054), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [] If this change need a document change, I have updated the document\r\n- [] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-10T02:33:32Z","updated_at":"2020-12-22T07:13:10Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T01:27:51Z","merged_at":"2020-12-15T01:27:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"193db4207ea395671d4bf5552104e7a089dd2c4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1691596842,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkxNTk2ODQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/load","name":"area/load","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- There is a fe configuration called dynamic_partition_enable\r\n    which controls the opening and closing of the dynamic partition function.\r\n  When this configuration is false, it means that all tables do not support dynamic partitioning.\r\n\r\n- But when the user tried to create the dynamic partition table, Doris did not detect this parameter.\r\n  This will cause the user can normally create a dynamic partition table,\r\n    but in fact Doris cannot create a partition for this table.\r\n\r\n- This pr detect this config when building the table.\r\n  The dynamic partition table can be created only when the dynamic_partition_enable configuration is true.\r\n  If the configuration is false, the command to create a dynamic partition table will directly report an

Proposed changes\r\nThis patch mainly do the following refactors:\r\n- Use int64_t instead of int32_t for 'version' in DeleteHandler\r\n- Move some comments from .cpp to .h file, add some new comments in .h files, and also remove some meaningless comments\r\n- Use switch...case... instead of multiple if..else.. for DeleteConditionHandler::is_condition_value_valid\r\n- Use range loop to simplify code\r\n- Reduce some compare operations in Cond::del_eval\r\n- Improve some branch predictions in Reader\r\n- Fix and improve some unit tests\r\n\r\nCompare with #4925 , this patch fix two bugs:\r\n- Initialize '_collect_iter' which missing initialized when resolve conflict\r\n- Make DeleteHandler and Conditions not copiable and not assignable to avoid double free\r\n\r\n## Types of
