By default, anything typed in the password field should be masked\r\n2. User should be able to toggle to see the password and toggle back to hiding the password ONLY WHEN entering the password when CONNECTING a database, not when EDITING one\r\n3. When editing an existing db connection the password should be masked WITHOUT the option to show the password to prevent unintentionally showing passwords to someone who didn't initially connect the db\r\n4. See details in comment on show/hide icon and tooltip text\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nThe big number chart (and the whole browser) is crashing when it tries to calculate maximum font size that fits in the chart container. We do this in a loop, which breaks when width and height of big number text is less or equal the width and height of chart container.  The loop goes 1) are big number dimensions smaller than chart container? 2) if not, decrease font size by 1, recalculate dimensions, try again. The problem is that under some circumstances the container height passed to chart through props is... negative. That means we'll never satisfy the condition to break the loop and we'll keep decreasing the font size infinitely.\r\nWhy is the calculated chart height negative? We calculate it with a formula `containerHeight - headerHeight`. The problem is that our css allows the header to overflow the container, so `headerHeight > containerHeight`.\r\nThis PR fixes the css so that it doesn't allow title to overflow. I limited the title to maximum 2 lines. If it's truncated, we display a tooltip with a full title on hover.\r\nMoreover, I set the chart to have minimum height of 20px as a failsafe to ensure we never pass a negative value again.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/163165874-492089d4-923d-4e06-bc7f-1b101a3da941.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/163166343-4c1f2f38-f630-40d7-ac46-9e4e8cae3021.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n[dashboard_export_20220413T130001.zip](https://github.com/apache/superset/files/8480858/dashboard_export_20220413T130001.zip)\r\n\r\n1. Import the test dashboard (link above) - it's been prepared to always trigger the bug when you resize the window\r\n2. Make sure that resizing the browser window doesn't break anything\r\n3. The max number of lines of chart titles should be 2. If the title is longer, we display a tooltip with a full name.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes the xAxis scale in the time series chart V2 when time grain is quarter, which is different from the time series chart V1. The bar chart looks like it contains three months. Actually, the bar width does not represent how many months it contains but is an optimization done by echart itself to look better, echart does not know whether it is month or quarter.\r\n\r\nSo here we use [echart.minInterval](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#xAxis.minInterval) to make sure that xAxis scale is the same as time grain, which does not lead to user misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### before\r\n#### Time-series chart (nvd3)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/163138430-43ab07c1-6c35-4c2f-a548-2f058d02d235.png)\r\n#### Time-series chart V2 (echart)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/163138227-b228cbe3-6ba9-481a-8773-47dd589a89b2.png)\r\n### after\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/163138166-d1a1f402-5844-496f-9aaf-29d46f520536.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen serving Superset, there are many cases where it may be desirable to customize specific UI elements. This PR introduces a UiOverrideRegistry for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe new `TypedRegistry` is better suited for this than the existing Registry class, because different keys can have different types of values, and all the keys offered by Superset are enumerated here.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIn a change introduced in #18609, SQL Lab incorrectly replaces a missing schema with an empty object when dispatching the query action, which causes the query to fail in the backend, which later breaks the whole UI and makes it impossible to enter SQL Lab again.\r\n\r\nSee a few examples of what a valid schema is in this context:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/3a231f6b871cdab00b9dfb6192af76cf4cf9832a/superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditorLeftBar/index.tsx#L42\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/3a231f6b871cdab00b9dfb6192af76cf4cf9832a/superset-frontend/src/components/DatabaseSelector/index.tsx#L96\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/3a231f6b871cdab00b9dfb6192af76cf4cf9832a/superset-frontend/src/components/DatabaseSelector/index.tsx#L99\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nChange [SIP-68](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17543) db migrations to no-op and stop shadow-writing datasets to new models.\r\n\r\nWe should not include the shadow writing logic to official releases as it increases computation costs yet contributes nothing to end user experience (for now). Given the original migration is expensive and we [likely need to redo it](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19421) anyway, it's the best to skip it for now.\r\n\r\nThis PR should only be cherry-picked into the LTS branches such as 1.5 and 2.0. Once #19421 is ready and the new dataset models started to replace the old models, we'll just re-cut the release from `master` and ignore this PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nOn Table Charts, the auto-sizing in table charts forces a scroll bar in and expands the cells even when there is space available.\r\nThis implements a scroll bar and takes away additional space that isn't needed. For example - a table chart with 6 columns and enough empty space will still implement a scroll.\r\n\r\nThe issue why this is happening is that, when calculating the columns width, we're using the `clientWidth`, which rounds the number. So, the total width of the table could be 1000, but due to rounding, the sum of the columns could yield 1001 and thus causing the scrollbar to appear.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the width calculation to `getBoundingClientRect`, which does gives the result without rounding (we're still defaulting to clientWidth, just in case).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/162524426-0e9ed1a9-9207-438b-a34c-5e1aaa65ec16.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/162524290-4ec1ce06-6030-4bb7-abc9-c585c451162e.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a chart table\r\n2. Add some columns to it\r\n3. Run the query\r\n\r\nThe chart, if no width is specified to any of it's column, should take the width of the panel and don't show the horizontal scrollbar\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFix a potential table name conflict in integration tests `test_clean_requests_after_schema_grant`.\r\n\r\nSometimes when the example database has `wb_health_population`'s schema in another name---for example, `public` instead of `None` when in postgres (depending on how you configure `SQLALCHEMY_EXAMPLES_URI`), rerunning this test will fail and report \"table already exists\" error from [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/34b55765c4b0cbd8f0b9f89c6ca0f62f4478270e/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L1893-L1896). It seems the intention of the test was to reset table.schema to its original schema, but simply assumed it used to be `None`. This PR makes this test more idempotent by actually changing the schema of the same table to the original schema.\r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe data analyst would like to see the aggregate total to be displayed in a Pie/Donut chart. Similar to the Big Number chart. This will allow the viewer to see aggregate values as well as their breakdowns rather than having to calculate.\r\nThis PR adds:\r\n- `show_total` control to decide whether to display the aggregate count.\r\n- total text will display at top of normal pie chart by default if `show_total` control checked\r\n- total text will display at center of donuct chart by default if `show_total` control checked\r\n- total text will adjust its own position according to the position of the legend.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### control panel\r\n<img width=\"373\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/162456693-6048ab7f-0355-45f4-92d2-b6e057677b38.png\">\r\n\r\n### pie chart\r\n<img width=\"1827\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/162453884-4112fa41-3995-44dc-baa9-1b46566fa395.png\">\r\n\r\n### donuct chart\r\n<img width=\"1827\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/162453804-2cce62e6-ce15-4760-81b7-98d0bf34b9ba.png\">\r\n\r\n### with legend\r\n<img width=\"1827\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/162454032-f3c893bd-b286-4328-b13e-8aa7d7639f67.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nPR #19341 introduced a regression that caused the adhoc filter value selector to disappear if a multioperator (IN, NOT IN) was chosen and there were no options. It is typical for the options to be missing if the \"populate autocomplete filters options\" option has been disabled in the dataset properties. I believe the reason for the bug that #19341 attempted to address was due to only checking if a selected item was `typeof 'object'`. This is `true` for `null`, which caused the logic to assume the value was in fact a `LabeledValue` (=object with keys `value` and `label`). Here we introduce a typeguard to make the checking even more robust, and remove the logic that delays rendering of `SelectWithLabel`.\r\n\r\nI checked that the original issue that #19341 set out to fix still works after this change. However, *deselecting* a NULL value doesn't seem to work properly if there are other falsy values (for this we'll need to use `LabeledValue` and use a custom `key` as do make sure each entry is unique). However, I consider this a separate issue which should be addressed in the native filter, so will address that in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the dropdown renders correctly:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/162419361-9aa255f4-e5bb-41a9-8a5d-7a9032392e4c.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the dropdown disappeared if there were no options:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/162419451-b1a03df2-7263-4ed4-84f4-6b55226681b9.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nThe Time column in the Query History is being displayed as an Invalid date.\r\n\r\nThe reason being the underlying data type is numeric with precision, to get sub-second precision.\r\nThat means the returned json value is a string (to keep the precision) and in turn, it fails the conversion to a moment object.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img

Go to SQL lab -> SQL Editor\r\n2. Run any query\r\n3.

Sep\r\nQ4: Oct - Dec\r\n\r\nThe reason is that time grain expression against database returns date as the first date of each quarter. (e.g.: Q1: 1st Jan, Q2: 1st Apr). But when we visualize this data using time_series bar chart v2, the returned date is the middle date of the bar chart. \r\n\r\nSolution: added 1 month to time grain expression for each database.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1530\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39701522/162277520-07970d5f-94a6-4648-9d51-2e845a9ef85f.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1532\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39701522/162277294-94e264e6-04f8-4f51-b912-7022a50393c9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen using the export_dashboards command on the CLI the order of the datasources in the json is inconsistent so if you're trying to use git versioning theres a big diff from reordering. This PR implements sorting so this no longer happens.\r\n\r\nResolves: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/19478\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nI tried editing https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/f91f83d011b4c83576f5fff76d502f5616f2972d/tests/integration_tests/cli_tests.py#L76 like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    json_content = json.loads(contents)\r\n\r\n    # check that datasources are ordered consistently\r\n    assert json_content.get(\"datasources\")[0].get(\"__SqlaTable__\").get(\"database_id\") == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nto assert the order of the datasource ids but none of the existing dashboard fixtures have multiple datasources and I couldnt figure out how to add one with multiple datasources. So I didnt include the change to the test, if theres a way to stage a multi-datasource dashboard in the tests then I can gladly add a new test to do that!\r\n\r\nTo manually test prior to this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Create multiple datasources in your Superset instance\r\n2. Create a chart with each datasource\r\n3. Add both charts to a dashboard\r\n4. Export the dashboard using the CLI\r\n5. Make a copy of the exported file\r\n6. Export again and do a diff on the new vs copied file (you might need to export a few times before it changes because the ordering is random)\r\n\r\nFollowing this PR there should never be a diff in the datasources if nothing changed.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently we are initializing the sandboxed Jinja environment with `undefined=DebugUndefined`, which causes the template to return the unrendered template if an undefined variable is referenced. This is both confusing and will seldom be very helpful, as the majority of jinja templates will generate invalid values when left unrendered.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the following:\r\n- Replace `DebugUndefined` with `StrictUndefined` to ensure that referencing undefined objects in jinja code results in an error rather than silently failing and leaving the template unrendered. An integration test is added to check for this behavior (see `test_get_template_undefined`).\r\n- Replace references to Jinja specific `TemplateException` with `SupersetTemplateException` to decouple templating from Jinja\r\n- add `try-except` blocks to all places in SQLA model where we call `BaseTemplateProcessor.process_template` to ensure that they are recast to `QueryObjectValidationError`.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nBefore this update, when we have long number in text email report for table chart, report was not showing correct value.\r\n\r\nIt was because `pd` converts long float value into `e` type. \r\n\r\nIn this pr, we added some display viz option into `pd`, so all long float value are displayed as a string.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nUsing the Jinja2 function `filter_values` in WHERE clauses today is very cumbersome, requiring the user to quote and join elements from the list:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM some_table\r\nWHERE\r\n    action in ({{ \"'\" + \"','\".join(filter_values('action_type')) + \"'\" }})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created a simple `where_in` filter that does the same logic, since this is a common pattern for users. With the filter users only need to write:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM some_table\r\nWHERE\r\n    action IN {{ filter_values('action_type')|where_in }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\nfix(chartdata): improve querying performance for long `where ... in (...)` statements.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAs described in https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/issues/621, calling `sqlparse.format` and `sqlparse.parse` functions with grouping queries will cause quadratic runtime, ending in very long computation times for queries with large statements, e.g., long `IN` statements with a large number of keys.\r\n\r\nIn Chart Data, the sqlparse functions are needlessly called, this has several reasons:\r\n1. The ChartData component will automatically generate most of the structure of the final query. It is possible, however, that users can add custom SQLs for filters, columns, etc.) - However, validation of the query will also happen in `connectors/sqla/models/get_query_str_extended`, so if erroneos sql code is produced, we will still receive an error. \r\n2. The structure of the finished SQL query will be valid in every case, and the query will also *never* consist of multiple consecutive queries. Hence, it is not necessary to parse the query for a possible sequence of multiple queries. (which happens in [models/core.py](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/models/core.py#L424).\r\n3. The SQL automatically created by [compile_sqla_query(sqlaq.sqla_query)](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L798) will already result in a readable sql. Reformating the sql using `sqlparser.format(sql, reindent=True)` to reindent will only have a minor improvement in readability while sacrificing computation time.\r\n\r\nLooking at the issue #19567 , querying times vary significantly depending on `IN` clause key size. Omitting the `parse()` and `format()` functions from the code used by ChartData will solve this issue, without having any impediments.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER ANIMATED GIF\r\n####

forgery.\n<ul>\n<li>The code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can\nallow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked\nportion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low\npublic exponent is being used.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR moves the \"Save\" button to chart header and \"Run\" button (renamed to \"Create/Update chart\") to the bottom of control panel.\r\n\r\nFull list of changes:\r\n- \"Save\" button moved to the right side if chart header\r\n- Renamed \"Run\" button to \"Create chart\" if it's a new chart (no query has been made yet) or \"Update chart\" if queries were run before on that chart\r\n- Moved \"Create/Update chart\" button to the bottom of control panel - it's sticky, meaning it always stays in place when user scrolls the control panel\r\n- \"Data/Customize\" tab bar is sticky - only the content of tab gets scrolled, the tab bar stays in place\r\n- Error icon moved from next to \"Run/Save\" buttons to \"Data\" tab header\r\n- Change empty state message when creating chart and all controls have been added - \"Your chart is ready to go!\"\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/161961889-643b4ec0-97fb-4a9d-9b6c-56a0174f6498.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create new chart\r\n2. Verify that the button at the bottom of control panel says \"Create chart\" and is disabled\r\n3. Add necessary controls\r\n4. \"Create chart\" button should not be disabled now + the message in empty state changed to a prompt to click the button\r\n5. Click \"Create chart\" button\r\n6. Verify that query was run and the name of the button changed to \"Update chart\"\r\n7. Verify that \"Save\" button in the chart header works as before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nThe `adodbapi` dialect appears to be the only dialect included in `SQLAlchemy` 1.3 that doesn't implement the `dbapi()` method, and is fully removed in 1.4. To avoid logging a confusing warning, we should avoid trying to use the driver until we bump to 1.4.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPrevious to this check, the following would regularly pop up on logs:\r\n```\r\n2022-04-06 13:31:24,380:WARNING:superset.db_engine_specs:Unable to load dialect <class 'sqlalchemy.dialects.mssql.adodbapi.MSDialect_adodbapi'>: type object 'MSDialect_adodbapi' has no attribute 'dbapi'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCall `http://host/api/v1/database/available/` and make sure the you get the same available drivers as before, but no warning on the logs.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn the new Dataset model, we check if a column is temporal by checking the `python_type` of all columns. However, the property isn't guaranteed to be implemented: https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/7935b76d9e5b5fd4e64b2c6c3473737186acf2db/lib/sqlalchemy/sql/type_api.py#L618-L635 .

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes two problems in SQL Lab if the `SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE` feature flag is enabled (default as of 2.0):\r\n- When opening SQL Lab and a persisted tab is referencing a database that has been deleted, SQL Lab will fail with a 500 (see error below). This is due to `self.database` being `None`\r\n- when the above has been resolved, and the user switches to a tab referencing a missing database, a 404 is returned from the function names request, which in turn triggers an error toast. As this is an expected case, we avoid dispatching an error toast for 404s.\r\n\r\n### SCRENSHOTS\r\nWhen accessing SQL Lab with `SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE` turned on and a referenced database being missing, the following happens:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n   \"errors\":[\r\n      {\r\n         \"message\":\"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'database_name'\",\r\n         \"error_type\":\"GENERIC_BACKEND_ERROR\",\r\n         \"level\":\"error\",\r\n         \"extra\":{\r\n            \"issue_codes\":[\r\n               {\r\n                  \"code\":1011,\r\n                  \"message\":\"Issue 1011 - Superset encountered an unexpected error.\"\r\n               }\r\n            ]\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter the above has been fixed and switching tabs into a tab where the database is missing, the following error toast is brought up:\r\n<img width=\"1313\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/161932512-4f66e6d3-e1ca-442e-b184-d5f9cd7aeebb.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the data cache is configured, after a cache invalidation in the explore, the results view is not impacted.\r\nSo, if we modify the underlying dataset while using the explore, and we try to invalidate the cache, then the chart correctly displays the new data, but the view results doesn't.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that, after a cache invalidation, both the chart and results reflect the latest data.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/161868686-e21df3d3-715b-4dab-8ab4-56bb0c8f928c.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/161868702-d739e8b9-4687-4d9c-9bed-b10360554a9b.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a table chart with raw records, pointing to a dataset that is easy to update (Gsheets for example)\r\n2. Add or remove some rows from your dataset\r\n3. Refresh the cache on the chart\r\n\r\nEnsure that, after cache invalidation, both the chart and data results view reflect the latest data.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nWhen opening welcome page (`/superset/welcome/`) it took between 10 and 20 seconds to show first results.
