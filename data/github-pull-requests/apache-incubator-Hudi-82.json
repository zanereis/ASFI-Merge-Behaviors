pull request\r\n\r\nJIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1194\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSeparate ```HoodieHiveClient``` into three classes:\r\n\r\n- ```HoodieHiveClient``` which implements all the APIs through Metastore API.\r\n- ```HoodieHiveJDBCClient``` which extends from HoodieHiveClient and overwrite several the APIs through Hive JDBC.\r\n- ```HoodieHiveDriverClient``` which extends from HoodieHiveClient and overwrite several the APIs through Hive Driver.\r\n\r\nAnd also introduce a new parameter ```hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.hive_client_class``` which could let you choose which Hive Client class to use.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAfter fetching hbase index for a record, Hudi performs validation that the commit timestamp stored in hbase for that record is a `commit` on the timeline. This makes any record that is stored to hbase index during a `deltacommit` considered an invalid index and treated as a new record. This causes the hbase index to be updated every time which leads to records being able to be in multiple partitions and even in different file groups within same partition.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Modify HbaseIndex.checkIfValidCommit to consider DELTA_COMMIT timestamp as valid index timestamp\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Verified test failed on MOR table before change and succeeding now\r\n  - Manually verified by:\r\n       * Uploaded patched JAR to EMR 5.30.1 cluster\r\n       * Create MOR table w/ HBASE index\r\n       * Upsert record\r\n       * Upsert record with new partition\r\n       * Validate new partition was not created and existing partition displayed update to

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen using ```fixed_len_byte_array``` decimal type as Hudi record key, Hudi would not correctly display the decimal value, instead, Hudi would display it as a byte array. \r\n\r\nDuring the Hudi writing phase, Hudi would save the parquet source data into Avro Generic Record. For example, the source parquet data has a column with decimal type:\r\n```\r\noptional fixed_len_byte_array(16) LN_LQDN_OBJ_ID (DECIMAL(38,0));\r\n```\r\nThen Hudi will convert it into the following avro decimal type:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"name\" : \"LN_LQDN_OBJ_ID\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ {\r\n      \"type\" : \"fixed\",\r\n      \"name\" : \"fixed\",\r\n      \"namespace\" : \"hoodie.hudi_ln_lqdn.hudi_ln_lqdn_record.LN_LQDN_OBJ_ID\",\r\n      \"size\" : 16,\r\n      \"logicalType\" : \"decimal\",\r\n      \"precision\" : 38,\r\n      \"scale\" : 0\r\n    }, \"null\" ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis decimal field would be stored as a fixed length bytes array. And in the reading phase, Hudi will convert this bytes array back to a readable decimal value through this [converter](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/hudi/AvroConversionHelper.scala#L58). \r\n\r\nHowever, the problem is, when setting decimal type as record keys, Hudi would read the value from Avro Generic Record and then directly convert it into ```String``` type(See [here](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-spark/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/DataSourceUtils.java#L76)). As a result, what shows in the ```_hoodie_record_key``` field would be something like: ```LN_LQDN_OBJ_ID:[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 25, 40, 95, -71]```. \r\n\r\nSo we need to handle this special case to convert bytes array back before converting to ```String```.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSimilar to what we did for Date type columns: https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/2d040145810b8b14c59c5882f9115698351039d1#diff-21f77fb372831d468dab018505592e12, I added another logic to handle decimal type column.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added a decimal test case in TestDataSourceUtils.java to verify the change.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x]

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this pull request is to implement changes required on Hudi side to get Bootstrapped tables integrated with Presto. The testing was done against **presto 0.232** and following changes were identified to make it work:\r\n\r\n- Annotation **UseRecordReaderFromInputFormat** is required on **HoodieParquetInputFormat** as well, because the reading for bootstrapped tables needs to happen through record reader to be able to perform the merge. On presto side, this annotation is already handled.\r\n\r\n- We need to internally maintain `VIRTUAL_COLUMN_NAMES` because presto's internal hive version **hive-apache-1.2.2** has `VirutalColumn` as a class, versus the one we depend on in hudi which is an **enum**. This results in following error in presto:\r\n```\r\n2020-08-10T21:59:58.957Z\tERROR\tremote-task-callback-2\tcom.facebook.presto.execution.StageExecutionStateMachine\tStage execution

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIntroducing a OptimisticConsistencyGuard for eventual consistent stores. This will sleep for configured period of time only on APPEAR. It is a no-op for DISAPPEAR. This is specifically for eventually consistent stores like S3A filesystem and here is the rational.\r\nThis guard is used when deleting data files corresponding to marker files that needs to be deleted.\r\nThere are two tricky cases that needs to be considered. \r\nCase 1 : A data file creation is eventually consistent and hence\r\n when issuing deletes, the file may not be found. \r\nCase 2: a data file was never created in the first place as the process crashed.\r\n In S3A, GET and LIST are eventually consistent, and delete() implementation internally does a LIST/EXISTS.\r\n Prior to this patch, hudi was leveraging FailSafeConsistencyGuard which was doing the following to delete data files.\r\n Step1: wait for all files to appear with linear backoff timer w/ a max timer.\r\n Step2: issue deletes\r\n Step3: wait for all files to disappear.\r\n Step1 and Step2 is handled by {@link FailSafeConsistencyGuard}.\r\n\r\n We are simplifying these steps with OptimisticConsistencyGuard as below.\r\n Step1: Check if all files exists. If yes, proceed to next step. Else Sleep for a configured threshold before proceeding to next step.\r\n Step2: issue deletes.\r\n\r\n With this, if any files that was created, should be available within configured threshold(eventual consistency).\r\n Delete() will return false if FileNotFound. So, both cases are taken care of this {@link ConsistencyGuard}.\r\nStep3 is not required since if FileIsNotFound, delete() would have returned false and hence we ignore the return values. But if file exists and if file could not be deleted, some exception would be thrown. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Added OptimisticConsistencyGuard to check for file/files appearance in eventually consistent cloud stores*\r\n  - *Added a new config in ConsistencyGuardConfig for the sleep timer (hoodie.optimistic.consistency.guard.sleep_time_ms)*\r\n  - *Fixed instantiation of ConsistencyGuard in HoodieTable to use OptimisticConsistencyGuard*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests to TestConsistencyGuard to verify the change.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n

Make `HoodieTestTable` the sole class for creating hoodie data/metadata files for testing\r\n- Consolidate relevant util methods to `HoodieTestTable`\r\n\r\nTrying to draw a line between \r\n- what a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n* - This pull request adds upgrade/downgrade infra for smooth transition from list based rollback to marker based rollback*\r\n* - A new property called hoodie.table.version is added to hoodie.properties file as part of this. Whenever hoodie is launched with newer table version i.e 1(or moving from pre 0.6.0 to 0.6.0), an upgrade step will be executed automatically to adhere to marker based rollback.*\r\n* - This automatic upgrade step will happen just once per dataset as the hoodie.table.version will be updated in property file after upgrade is completed once*\r\n* - Similarly, a command line tool for Downgrading is added if incase some user wants to downgrade hoodie from table version 1 to 0 or move from hoodie 0.6.0 to pre 0.6.0*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Added UpgradeDowngradeUtil to assist in upgrading or downgrading hoodie table*\r\n  - *Added Interfaces for upgrade and downgrade and concrete implementations for upgrading from 0 to 1 and downgrading from 1 to 0.*\r\n  - *Made some changes to ListingBasedRollbackHelper to expose just rollback stats w/o performing actual rollback, which will be consumed by Upgrade infra*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added TestUpgradeDowngradeUtil to verify the change.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n

change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\nYou can refer to the documents： \r\nhttp://hudi.apache.org/docs/docker_demo.html\r\n\r\nAlso, We have implemented this feature on Tencent cloud EMR product, please read the link: https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/589/42955\r\n\r\nenvironments:\r\n\r\n- hadoop: 2.8.5\r\n\r\n- hive: 2.3.5\r\n\r\n- spark:  2.4.3\r\n\r\n- hudi: release-0.5.1-incubating\r\n\r\nThe general steps for hudi in tencent object storage(cos) as follows:\r\n\r\n- step1: Upload config to cos\r\n\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -mkdir -p cosn://[bucket]/hudi/config\r\nhdfs dfs -copyFromLocal demo/config/*  cosn://[bucket]/hudi/config/\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Step 2: Incrementally ingest data from Kafka, and write to cos\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-submit --class org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer.HoodieDeltaStreamer --master yarn ./hudi-utilities-bundle_2.11-0.5.1-incubating.jar   --table-type COPY_ON_WRITE --source-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.JsonKafkaSource --source-ordering-field ts  --target-base-path cosn://[bucket]/usr/hive/warehouse/stock_ticks_cow --target-table stock_ticks_cow

cosn://[bucket]/hudi/config/kafka-source.properties --schemaprovider-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.FilebasedSchemaProvider --disable-compaction\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- Step3: Sync with Hive when data on cos\r\n```\r\nbin/run_sync_tool.sh  --jdbc-url jdbc:hive2://[hiveserver2_ip:hiveserver2_port] --user hadoop --pass isd@cloud --partitioned-by dt --base-path cosn://[bucket]/usr/hive/warehouse/stock_ticks_cow --database default --table stock_ticks_cow\r\n\r\nbin/run_sync_tool.sh  --jdbc-url jdbc:hive2://[hiveserver2_ip:hiveserver2_port] --user hadoop --pass hive --partitioned-by dt --base-path cosn://[bucket]/usr/hive/warehouse/stock_ticks_mor --database default --table stock_ticks_mor --skip-ro-suffix\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Step4: Query hudi table by hive or spark sql engine\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nbeeline -u jdbc:hive2://[hiveserver2_ip:hiveserver2_port] -n hadoop --hiveconf hive.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat --hiveconf hive.stats.autogather=false\r\n\r\nspark-sql --master yarn --conf spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet=false\r\n\r\nhivesqls:\r\nselect symbol, max(ts) from stock_ticks_cow group by symbol HAVING symbol = 'GOOG';\r\nselect `_hoodie_commit_time`, symbol, ts, volume, open, close  from stock_ticks_cow where  symbol = 'GOOG';\r\nselect symbol, max(ts) from stock_ticks_mor group by symbol HAVING
