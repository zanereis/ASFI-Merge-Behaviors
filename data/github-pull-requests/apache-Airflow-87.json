Compare to Debian Repo:\r\n- Debian Bullseye (11) use previous LTS [10.5](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libmariadb-dev) \r\n- Debian Bookworm (12) use current LTS [10.11](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/libmariadb-dev) \r\n\r\n**AMD64** (aka x86_64): Still use Oracle MySQL Libraries from current LTS 8.0, technically it is not named as LTS, but who cares?\r\n**ARM64** Use MariaDB latest LTS version, same version also use in Debian 12\r\n\r\nI've also tried to replace MySQL to MariaDB **client libraries 1 to 1**, because at that moment we use not the same replacement, anyway even now (main branch and 2.7.1) current combination works fine, at least I have no issues for last 6 months since we have support of MySQL in breeze on ARM \r\n\r\nWhen you tried to resolve different version of MySQL and/or MariaDB on different distro\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/3998685/49091021-ddb4-44ca-9efa-d30aaf8e9b46)\r\n\r\nIn case if one day we decide to use only MariaDB client libraries even for AMD64 then we need to change _L138_ line:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/5dff482026bfbecd53663d3c54689694bad7fa15/scripts/docker/install_mysql.sh#L134-L140\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Previous description</summary>\r\n  \r\nTrying to update mysql-compatible client libraries\r\n\r\nMariaDB:\r\n- Use specific version\r\n- Use MariaDB repo (https://archive.mariadb.org/) instead of Debian's\r\n- Explicit install compatible with mysql client libraries\r\n\r\nMySQL:\r\n- workaround for find name of `libmysqlclient`, e.g. in MySQL 8.0 repo it has name `libmysqlclient21` in innovation it has name `libmysqlclient22`, and I have no idea is it bumped when 8.2 (next innovation released) \r\n- workaround for decide which branch we should use `mysql-X.Y` or `mysql-innovation`\r\n- and other kind of pain...pain...pain. IMHO better use compatible client libraries from MariaDB even for X86_64 rather then struggling with oracle APT repo. **(maybe in the future, not now, not in this

goal here is to allow behavioral parity w.r.t. sensor timeouts between deferrable and non-deferrable sensor operators.\r\n\r\nWith non-deferrable sensors, if there's a sensor timeout, the task fails without retry.  But currently, with deferrable sensors, that does not happen.\r\n\r\nSince there's already a \"timeout\" capability on triggers, we can use this for sensor timeout.  Essentially all that was missing was the ability to distinguish between trigger timeouts and other trigger errors.  With this capability, base sensor can distinguish between the two, and reraise deferral timeouts as sensor timeouts.\r\n\r\nSo, here we add a new exception type, TaskDeferralTimeout, which base sensor reraises as AirflowSensorTimeout. Then, to take advantage of this feature, a sensor need only ensure that its timeout is passed when deferring. For convenience, we update the task deferred exception signature to take int and float in addition to timedelta, since that's how `timeout` attr is defined on base sensor.  But we do not change the exception attribute type.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep this PR focused, this PR only updates one sensor to use the timeout functionality, namely, time delta sensor.  Other sensors will have to be done as followups.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOld description below ⬇️ \r\n\r\nAlternative to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/32990\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32638\r\n\r\nThis is a less invasive approach.  Essentially, what we do here is, update `BaseOperator.resume_execution` so that when trigger times out then it raises special exception `AirflowDeferralTimeout`.\r\n\r\nThen, `BaseSensorOperator.resume_execution`, we reraise `AirflowDeferralTimeout` as a `AirflowSensorTimeout`.\r\n\r\nSo, if a sensor resumes from a timed-out deferral, then it's interpreted as a sensor timeout.\r\n\r\nAll that is required is for a sensor to add a timeout to the deferral.\r\n\r\nExample logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n[2023-08-25, 07:00:54 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1357} INFO - Resuming after deferral\r\n[2023-08-25, 07:00:54 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1380} INFO - Executing <Task(TimeDeltaSensorAsync): delta_sensor> on 2023-08-25 07:00:32.864128+00:00\r\n[2023-08-25, 07:00:54 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:57} INFO - Started process 50543 to run task\r\n[2023-08-25, 07:00:54 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:84} INFO - Running: ['airflow', 'tasks', 'run', 'simple2', 'delta_sensor', 'manual__2023-08-25T07:00:32.864128+00:00', '--job-id', '129', '--raw', '--subdir', '/Users/dstandish/code/airflow/airflow/example_dags/async_timeout.py', '--cfg-path', '/var/folders/9c/tknx7xx10qx92983y1r5djb40000gn/T/tmp72slvjz_']\r\n[2023-08-25, 07:00:54 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:85} INFO - Job 129: Subtask delta_sensor\r\n[2023-08-25, 07:00:54 UTC] {task_command.py:415} INFO - Running <TaskInstance: simple2.delta_sensor manual__2023-08-25T07:00:32.864128+00:00 [running]> on host daniels-mbp.lan\r\n[2023-08-25, 07:00:54 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1933} ERROR - Task failed with exception\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/dstandish/code/airflow/airflow/sensors/base.py\", line 288, in resume_execution\r\n    return super().resume_execution(next_method, next_kwargs, context)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/dstandish/code/airflow/airflow/models/baseoperator.py\", line 1605, in resume_execution\r\n    raise AirflowDeferralTimeout(error)\r\nairflow.exceptions.AirflowDeferralTimeout: Trigger timeout\r\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/dstandish/code/airflow/airflow/sensors/base.py\", line 290, in resume_execution\r\n    raise AirflowSensorTimeout(*e.args) from e\r\nairflow.exceptions.AirflowSensorTimeout: Trigger timeout\r\n[2023-08-25, 07:00:54 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1398} INFO - Immediate failure requested.

transformation that happened on `views.py`. \r\n\r\n## Worth noting\r\n1) It feels awkward adding `is_paused` to `fields_skip_logging` but I decided to do it because it will prevent traversing the list down the line looking for the tuple location.\r\n2) Now it will properly cast the `bool` type into the correct Python equivalent: `False|True` rather than `\"false\"|\"true\"`.\r\n\r\nHappy to

The value is a large integer, which *should* always exceed the `execution_timeout` value for a given task. I believe this is why the line setting the value to `sys.maxsize` is accompanied by a comment:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwaiter.config.max_attempts = sys.maxsize  # timeout is managed by airflow\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanges in v8.0.0 introduced a configurable value defaulting to 100 for this parameter, with a delay defaulting to 6 seconds (the changes were introduced to resolve #30586). The line above remains, but I think it is being overridden by the call to `waiter.wait`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        waiter.wait(\r\n            cluster=self.cluster,\r\n            tasks=[self.arn],\r\n            WaiterConfig={\r\n                \"Delay\": self.waiter_delay,\r\n                \"MaxAttempts\": self.waiter_max_attempts, # !!! Overriding previously set max_attempts?\r\n            },\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe defaults for these previously unavailable parameters have been set to:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        waiter_delay: int = 6,\r\n        waiter_max_attempts: int = 100,\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the introduction of a default value of 100 has changed the behaviour of the operator - now when not specified, all tasks detach from the running ECS Task at 10 minutes, reporting failed status back to Airflow.\r\n\r\nThe fix replaces the default value with `sys.maxsize` - which should revert the waiter functionality back to prior working versions.\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

This way the system can recover from the situation when a task was set to `RESTARTING` state externally (webserver request) but both task process and scheduler were dead when it happened.\r\n\r\nThis approach is safe because `adopt_or_reset_orphaned_tasks()` only modifies tasks that were queued by a scheduler that is no longer running. In theory it could reset a task which is still running even though its scheduler is dead, but it is identical situation as with `RUNNING` tasks which are also updated by this method.\r\n\r\n<!--

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33679\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30784 we added new template fields, but in the case of the snowflake operators, this attribute was never actually set during initialization (it was just passed to the parent class as `conn_id`). \r\n\r\nAs a result, these operators fail with the following exception:\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'snowflake_conn_id' is configured as a template field but SnowflakeCheckOperator does not have this attribute.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyways, this PR just adds the missing attributes.\r\n\r\nI replicated the

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/28086\r\n\r\nThis is very much a first-pass / WIP but I wanted to get some early input on the design decisions.\r\n\r\n#### tl;dr\r\n\r\nThis allows a user to define a connection-backed secret to be consumed by the KubernetesPodOperator. The KPO handles the creation of these secrets at execution time and cleans them up after the fact.\r\n\r\nA `KubernetesConnectionSecret` is almost identical to a regular `Secret`, except for the removal of the `secret` param and the addition of the `conn_id` param. A secret name is generated at run-time and added to the secret object, after which it can be used as a regular `Secret`.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.secret import KubernetesConnectionSecret\r\nfrom airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.pod import KubernetesPodOperator\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\n# this will mount the password from the `my_conn` connection at `/etc/secret_password`\r\nconnection_secret = KubernetesConnectionSecret(\"volume\", \"/etc/secret_password\", \"my_conn\", key=\"password\")\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"kube_pod_with_connection_secrets\",\r\n    start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1),\r\n) as dag:\r\n    k = KubernetesPodOperator(\r\n        namespace=\"default\",\r\n        image=\"ubuntu:16.04\",\r\n        cmds=[\"bash\", \"-cx\"],\r\n        arguments=[\"echo\", \"10\"],\r\n        connection_secrets=[connection_secret],\r\n        task_id=\"task\",\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Open Questions:\r\n\r\n - How should we map a connection into the secret object? Currently I'm just writing out all of the fields to a dict.\r\n\r\n#### TODO (before merging):\r\n\r\n - [ ] Additional test coverage in kubernetes_tests\r\n - [ ] Add documentation around this feature\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-23T22:10:58Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T01:26:15Z","closed_at":"2024-01-09T01:26:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e03e4d4585184402913a0c9e5d4c4570ce1f01a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

As a result, when you rerun a task, logs from the first run are not shown in the UI because `task_instance.start_date` is after the first run. Not setting `start_time`  should solve the issue and should keep the optimization in place because, the optimization is based 100% on `end_time`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

deferred mode doesn't terminate on job failure and keeps waiting until timing out.\r\n\r\n### Root cause\r\nIn that scenario internally it uses **BatchSensorTrigger**, which in it's turn uses the `batch_job_complete` waiter.\r\nThis waiter is wrongly configured to return a `failed` state instead of the `failure` expected by **botocore**.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\nThis pull request fixes the waiter state and adds tests for it. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

has a very peculiar process of releasing new version every day, which means that it gives `pip` hard time to figure what will be the non-conflicting set of packages when we have too low of a minium version set as requirement.\r\n\r\nSince we had > 1.24 that means that `pip` had to consider more than 340 versions for botocore, but also for related mypy packages and also a number of aiobotocore packages when resolving eager-upgrade.\r\n\r\nWe limit all the relevant packages to 1.28 as minimum version now, and we should continue doing that regularly in the future.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to

Dataproc Links have been deprecated, but they were deprecated wrongly - the Deprecation Warnings were always raised when the dataproc module has been deprecated, but only few classes there were deprecated. This was because the warnings were added as class-level warnings rather than as warnings in constructors.\r\n\r\nAlso the deprecated classes have still been used in operators, raising the warnings even if the deprecation warnings have been moved from class to it's constructor.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that:\r\n\r\n* moves deprecation warnings from classes to constructors\r\n* replaces usage of deprecated links with those links that replaced the deprecated ones\r\n\r\nFound during implementing of #33640\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32839\r\n\r\n(Copying my comment from the original issue)\r\n\r\nWe have two places to define permissions (manually via the UI/CLI and in code via `DAG.access_control`) and there's no stance on which one takes precedence, which leads to all sorts of unexpected behaviour (mostly around [not cleaning up permissions enough](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/25149), or [cleaning up permissions too aggressively](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32839))\r\n\r\nI would propose making the access control for a given DAG authoritative as long as it is explicitly set. This way, if a DAG was updated, removing `access_control` from a DAG would not trigger a cleanup, but setting `access_control={}` would.\r\n\r\nSo we have three cases. A DAG defined like this:\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"test\",\r\n    schedule=\"0 0 * * *\",\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n    access_control={'role1': {'can_read'}, 'role2': {'can_read', 'can_edit', 'can_delete'}}\r\n) as dag:\r\n```\r\nWould overwrite any existing dag-level permissions for this DAG, ensuring that the roles listed here are the only ones with permissions specific to this DAG.\r\n\r\nWhile a DAG with explicitly empty access_contol, like this:\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"test\",\r\n    schedule=\"0 0 * * *\",\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n    access_control={}\r\n) as dag:\r\n```\r\nWould explicitly clear out all DAG-level permissions for this role.\r\n\r\nWhile a DAG without any access_control defined:\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"test\",\r\n    schedule=\"0 0 * * *\",\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n) as dag:\r\n```\r\nWould just defer to the existing DAG-level roles in the database.\r\n\r\nThis presents its own hazards around dangling and stray permissions, but I think that any approach here is going to have some sort of downside. The important part is that the approach to DAG-level access is clearly-defined and well documented (neither of which is true at the moment).\r\n\r\n#### TODO (before merging): \r\n\r\nI'll do these things as a part of this PR, but I want to get early feedback on the approach before I spend too much time here.\r\n\r\n - [ ] Add documentation around the precedence of different DAG-level access controls.\r\n - [ ] Update and add tests\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-22T21:33:49Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T14:32:36Z","closed_at":"2023-08-24T19:20:13Z","merged_at":"2023-08-24T19:20:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"370348a396b5ddfe670e78ad3ab87d01f6d0107f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jhtimmins","id":4926004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4926004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhtimmins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

on the appflow operator has always been complicated because we had no system test for it, i.e. no easy way to test it in the real world.\r\nThis was due to a limitation imposed by the code that restricted use to zendesk or salesforce source, which made it hard to setup.\r\nThis limitation makes sense for operators that play on filters, but the basic run flow operator works well for any source.\r\n\r\nSo I removed it and made a working system test that only relies on AWS systems and that we can run easily to test at least that running flows is working well.\r\n\r\nIn the process, I added a couple of things:\r\n - logging at every step while waiting, using the new helper we have\r\n - added a `max_attempts` param\r\n - added `template_fields`\r\n - deprecated the `source` field for the Run operator (it was unused in that code

new version of autossh installed yesterday when our AMI has been refreshed is a little less verbose when printing AUTOSSH_LOG entries. So far it produced entries for starting and running the autossh - which was not intersting if nothing was wrong:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023/08/21 06:33:27 autossh[31898]: starting ssh (count 1)\r\n2023/08/21 06:33:27 autossh[31898]: ssh child pid is 31899\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new versio will not produce any output and wont even create a file when nothing wrong happens and this caused our CI to fail at the very last moment - after the ARM instance has been stopped.\r\n\r\nThis PR won't fail when the autossh log is missing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

we have been using provider.yaml file modification as a sign that the docker image needs rebuilding when starting image. However just modification of provider.yaml file is not a sign that the image needs rebuilding. The image needs rebuilding when provider dependencies changed, but there are many more reasons why provider.yaml file changed - especially recently provider.yaml file contains much more information and dependencies are only part of it. Provider.yaml files can also be modified by release manager wnen documentation is prepared, but none of the documentation change is a reason for rebuilding the image.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimize the check for image building introducing two step process:\r\n\r\n* first we check if provider.yaml files changed\r\n* if they did, we regenerate provider dependencies by manully running the pre-commit script\r\n* then provider_dependencies.json is used instead of all providers to determine if the image needs rebuilding\r\n\r\nThis has several nice side effects:\r\n\r\n* the list of files that have been modified displayed to the user is potentially much smaller (no provider.yaml files)\r\n* provider_dependencies.json is regenereated automatically when you run any breeze command, which means that you do not have to have pre-commit installed to regenerate it\r\n* the notification \"image needs rebuilding\" will be printed less frequently to the user - only when it is really needed\r\n* preparing provider documentation in CI will not trigger image rebuilding (which might occasionally fail in such case especially when we bring back a provider from long suspension like it happened in #33574\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

used to have problems with `pip` backtracking when we relaxed\r\ntoo much open-telemetry dependencies. It turned out that the\r\nbacktracting was only happening on Python 3.8 and that it was\r\nultimately caused by conflict between importlib_metadata between\r\nAirflow and newer versions of opentelemetry (we had <5 for Python\r\n3.8, they had >6 for all versions. The reason for limiting it in\r\nAirflow was Celery that was not working well with importlib 5.\r\n\r\nSince Celery 5.3 solved the problems (released 6th of June) we can\r\nnow relax the importlib_metadata limit and set Celery to version >=\r\n5.3.0) which nicely resolves the conflict and there is no more\r\nbacktracking when trying to install newer versions of opentelemetry\r\nfor Python 3.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes: #33577\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Such kind of storage wrapper already exists as the `fsspec` library which is already an Airflow dependency.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at providing a base \"class\" (it's more like a mixin) to mix with blob storage provider (such as S3, GCS, etc.) to allow easy creation of fsspec.FileSystem from such hooks.\r\n\r\nI am not very fluent with the Hook/Connection API, so I am not sure that this PR make
