Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12057](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12057) Refactors Groovy unit tests to Java in `nifi-lookup-services` for the following Controller Services:\r\n\r\n- RestLookupService\r\n- SimpleDatabaseLookupService\r\n- DatabaseRecordLookupService\r\n\r\nThe RestLookupService tests now use OkHttp MockWebServer instead of Jetty, which simplifies the amount of code needed to handle HTTP communication.\r\n\r\nThe Database tests use mocked connections instead of Derby, reducing the test dependencies required.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12047](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12047) Adds HTTP/2 to the list of default HTTPS application protocols for NiFi and NiFi Registry, as part of changes for NiFi 2.0.\r\n\r\nNiFi 1.17.0 introduced optional support or HTTP/2 but kept the default setting as HTTP/1.1 to avoid unexpected changes. With modern browsers and clients supporting HTTP/2, enabling both HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 provides broad compatibility with better protocol optimization for newer clients.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adding the Jetty `HostHeaderCustomizer` to the Connector Factory in support of the NiFi `HostHeaderHandler` for validation. [RFC 7540 Section 8.1.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.html#section-8.1.2.3) notes that clients should use the `:authority` pseudo-header instead of the `Host` header, so the Jetty `HostHeaderCustomizer` derives a `Host` Header from the server name when the client does not send the header.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

I am still working to make a unit test to test this with in-memory janusgraph, but I have tested the following extensively in the nifi UI: \r\n\r\n* Script Submission with service settings\r\n* Bytecode Submission with yaml file settings\r\n\r\nUsing a localized janusgarph server. I am in the process of testing the other two options (script submission with yaml, and bytecode with service settings), but expect them to work as expected. \r\n\r\nI was unable to replicate: \r\n\r\n* https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4204#issuecomment-737444733 and would appreciate if @mattyb149  could detail exactly how he was creating that error so I can address\r\n\r\nThis code is ready for review, and I do not anticipate additional functionality at this time save for the addition of unit tests. \r\n\r\n[NIFI-7355](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-7355)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [ ] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes \r\n\r\nCan you please advise if you want me to squash this commit.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12033](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12033) Adds `EncryptContentAge` and `DecryptContentAge` Processors to the `nifi-cipher-nar` supporting the [age-encryption.org/v1](https://age-encryption.org/v1) specification for file encryption.\r\n\r\nThe Processors support the standard ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption algorithm for file payloads using chunked streaming as described in the [age payload](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/age.md#payload) section.\r\n\r\nThe `EncryptContentAge` Processor requires one or more [X25519](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/age.md#the-x25519-recipient-type) Public Key Recipients, which can be provided using either configuration properties or file resource references. The `EncryptContentAge` Processor also supports configurable File Encoding, defaulting to `BINARY`, but also supporting `ASCII` for Base64 encoding using the PEM standard.\r\n\r\nThe `DecryptContentAge` Processor requires one or more X25519 Private Key Identities. The `DecryptContentAge` Processor is capable of detecting File Encoding using the first several header bytes.\r\n\r\nThe [age-keygen](https://filippo.io/age/age-keygen.1) command can be installed separately for key pair generation and storage based on environment constraints.\r\n\r\nThe [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) command requires interactive console access for passphrase entry, so these Processors do not support the [scrypt recipient type](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/age.md#the-scrypt-recipient-type).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

The new `ConsumeElasticsearch` processor needed a set of query builder-like properties for constructing the necessary Elasticsearch `query`, so extending this to all Elasticsearch processors (where appropriate) seems sensible at the same time.\r\n\r\n- Added new `integration-tests` for the Elasticsearch processors to cover the different ways of building Elasticsearch Query DSL\r\n- Updated reading of test data files to be more consistent with the `support/nifi-1.x` branch so that these and future Elasticsearch processor changes will continue to be possible for the NiFi 1.x maintenance branch\r\n\r\n**Note for merge**: `JsonUtils.readString` will not be compatible from this PR for Java 8 (required on branch `support/nifi-1.x`). Instead, the merge will need to retain the `JsonUtils.readString` method already present on the support branch. Other changes here **should** be java 8 compatible\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache

It provides three options:\r\n* Output headers to `amqp$headers` attribute as string joined by the provided separator (Default) -> backward compatible\r\n* Output headers to `amqp$headers` attribute as a valid JSON string. Headers with null value will be present as well in json with null value\r\n* Output each header key as `<Header Key Prefix>.<header key>` attribute. It will not put headers which are null in message\r\n  * Property `<Header Key Prefix>` specifies the prefix value, defaults to `consume.amqp`\r\n\r\nTest cases updated for new changes to the processor\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12001) Refactors the `CertificateUtils` class into discrete modules and components for improved dependency management and testing.\r\n\r\nThe new `nifi-security-cert` module includes utilities for reading Subject Alternative Names and deriving TLS peer identities from certificates. These components use standard Java classes and do not require any additional dependencies, making this module more portable for framework and extension integration.\r\n\r\nThe new `nifi-security-cert-builder` module depends on the Bouncy Castle Provider and PKIX libraries for generating X.509 certificates. The Bouncy Castle Provider is over 8 MB at the time of this writing. This separation from other certificate utilities provides the groundwork for subsequent efforts to refactor Key Store generation, which requires certificate generation.\r\n\r\nRefactored changes include simplifying the certificate generation methods, which no longer require reordering distinguished names. The standard Java `X500Principal` class provides a contract for subject and issuer distinguished names, and the Bouncy Castle `RFC4519Style` class avoids the need to reverse distinguished name elements. The `StandardCertificateBuilder` provides a simplified constructor for self-signed certificates. The builder also includes methods for setting Subject DN and Subject Public Key properties to support certificates issued from a Certificate Authority.\r\n\r\nSeveral test classes for the TLS toolkit included references to the Bouncy Castle Provider, which are not necessary on Java 8 and following given the availability of standard algorithms and key sizes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11518](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11518) Upgrades Jetty dependencies from 9.4.51 to 10.0.15.\r\n\r\nJetty 10 represents a major version change that requires Java 11 as the minimum version, but retains compatibility with the `javax.servlet` interfaces. This provides an incremental upgrade approach without more substantial changes that would be required to adopt Jetty 11.\r\n\r\nMost of the package and module names remain the same between Jetty 9.4 and 10, with the notable exception of the WebSocket libraries, as highlighted in the [Jetty Migration Guide](https://eclipse.dev/jetty/documentation/jetty-12/programming-guide/index.html#pg-migration-94-to-10) from 9.4 to 10. These changes are reflected in the updates to the Jetty WebSocket Processors and Services.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include upgrading Solr dependencies from 8.11.2 to 9.2.1 in order to align with Jetty 10 dependencies. The Jetty `ELContextCleaner` class is deprecated and removed from the default web application configuration.\r\n\r\nThe Hadoop Client libraries also have a dependency on Jetty 9.4 WebSocket libraries for Yarn shell access. Yarn shell access is not necessary for NiFi component operation, but the referencing Hadoop class imports the Jetty client class. For this reason, several Maven configurations exclude Jetty 9.4 and include Jetty 10 WebSocket client to avoid runtime exceptions.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11789) This PR changes AbstractExecuteSQL in order to attempt to try to set the `fragment.count` attribute on the \"last\" FlowFile to be committed to the session in `onTrigger`.  It introduces some extra concepts that aren't consistent with the intended design of ProcessSession, and currently doesn't work when the query returns multiple result sets. That would require the DB driver to support a handful of methods and configurations that not all of them do (notably Derby). \r\n\r\nPerhaps it is too much outside the Process Session design principles to try and make this work. I a user NEEDS Output Batch Size it's because they have too much data to send downstream at once, which makes a downstream Merge seem like a moot point as the bottleneck would presumably show up there. Perhaps someone will do some performance metrics on how the two types of flows perform, one with Output Batch Size set and one without.\r\n\r\nUntil more discussion and pathfinding is done, this PR is

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11944](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11944) Removes the `customValidate()` method from `ExecuteStreamCommand` which would log a warning every five seconds based on the presence of dynamic properties.\r\n\r\nThe validate method used instance equality comparison instead of string content comparison, causing inaccurate log warnings when configuring the `Dynamic Property Arguments` strategy. Although this comparison could be corrected, the warning could still repeat every five seconds during component validation. As this warning does not make the component invalid, the best approach for now seems to be removing the validation warning approach.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking
