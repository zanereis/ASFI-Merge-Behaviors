performing the KeyWithNone elimination, the output PCollections of the original KeyWithNone transforms are deleted, and transforms that read from the deleted output PCollections are remapped to read from the remaining output PCollection. Originally, this remapping was only performed by leaf transforms in stages. This is incorrect because non-leaf transforms may also reference the deleted PCollections. This change fixes this by also applying the remapping to transforms in the context's components.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

number of records before each offset using a Multimap sideinput keyed with a filename to alleviate memory consumption concerns to materialize side input, see: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12924#discussion_r495050059.\r\n\r\nI am somewhat conflicted about this change since this adds a O(num_read_ranges_in_file) lookup per each row. I thought about using  Map <file_name, Map <offset, num_records_before_each_offset>> for contextual metadata in the side input, but according to offline discussion with @lukecwik, who is currently OOO, materialization will not work in this case.\r\n\r\nHappy to follow up if there is a better suggestion to address the existing memory concerns.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Should I retract this PR and start over?\r\n- My experience with htaccess files are limited and I didn't have a good way of testing the changes\r\n- It was mentioned in slack that the timing of this PR should wait until BEAM-9615 - Beam Schema Support is complete\r\n- Both integration and regression tests passed, yet I did not have success running the [sdks/go/test/run_integration_tests.sh](sdks/go/test/run_integration_tests.sh) on my machine and received the error: `gcloud crashed (TypeError): a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'`\r\n- Do the amount of changes associated with this PR, does it warrant updating `CHANGES.md`?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

- `:sdks:java:container:pullLicenses` runs a shell script that invokes Gradle at the top level as a subprocess\r\n - no artifacts are shared\r\n - always has `--rerun-tasks` so it also reruns everything\r\n - the two gradle processes overwrite and clobber/corrupt the same artifacts sometimes\r\n - seems to do a full java compile of some modules as part of the subprocess (sometimes?) which takes 7.5 minutes on my laptop\r\n - finds 80 license files and 22 notice files\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n - artifacts are shared\r\n - intermediate outputs are cached\r\n - no more clobbering\r\n - from a clean state takes 1 minute (most of it gradle configuration time) on my laptop\r\n - finds 182 license files and 41 notice files, and `diff` shows it is a strict superset (hence safe)\r\n    - some of these appear to be duplicate pulls, but not all\r\n    - before and after, this is entirely driven by what deps the `generateLicenseReport` task thinks matter\r\n    - before it was counting on a global run to cause projects to get configured; after, it is explicitly configuring the project we need. I think afterwards it is more accurate and deterministic, and ready to be refined.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

would like to be able to configure s3 compatible IO in order to be able to use alternative endpoints. https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10560 began moving in this direction but has been stalled for a while. The main comment there was that pipeline options should be used for configuration. \r\n\r\nSome open questions that I have are:\r\n\r\n* Is there a reason that a separate S3IO instance was created for every operation in the s3filesystem? If so I can save a reference to the pipeline options in the constructor and pass that in instead of saving the single S3IO.\r\n* Are there any naming considerations for the S3Options? Should they begin with a naming prefix to differentiate from other options provided on the command line?\r\n* Does it make sense to pass in tokens/keys through pipeline options? Should they instead be pulled from the environment?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

small maintenance fixes to the release guide:\r\n1. Remove an outdated checklist item to check the combined javadoc (no javadoc has been created yet).\r\n2. Add a checklist item to have JAVA_HOME set to JDK 8 (the script now checks for this, but it should also be documented).\r\n3. Updated the number of dependencies for Java SDK images. A recent change lowered it.\r\n4. Added an example commit for adding a blog post, instead of just a raw file.\r\n5. Replaced `2.XX` with `{$RELEASE_VERSION}` in the blog post template, for consistency.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR primarily adds support for `DataFrame.{drop,explode}`.\r\n\r\nI also noticed an edge case affecting the generated proxy in `rename`, so I included a change in this PR to make `TransformTest.run_scenario` verify that the deferred DataFrame's proxy matches the shape of the expected output. This detected a couple of issues (the aforementioned rename issue, verified in a new test, as well as a problem in `str.repeat`).\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

of opting out whole modules now only existing classes are opted out of type checking. This has the following benefits:\r\n\r\n - New code will be checked, even in modules that are not yet passing.\r\n - Code won't as easily backslide in modules that were partially fixed.\r\n - It will produce much more manageable incremental work, and limitless starter bugs!\r\n\r\nI produced the needed warnings (merged in other PRs) by removing the flag and then repeating the following, more or less:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava --continue 2>&1 | tee ~/tmp/gradle.log\r\n \r\ncat ~/tmp/gradle.log \\\r\n    | grep -e \"$PWD\"'.*error:.*' \\\r\n    | cut -d : -f 1 \\\r\n    | sort -u \\\r\n    | xargs grep -L -e '^@SuppressWarnings' \\\r\n    | xargs sed -E -i '' 's/^(public +)?((abstract|final) +)?(class|interface)/@SuppressWarnings(\"nullness\") &/'\r\n  \r\n./gradlew spotlessApply\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to still suppress type checking, arguments to `applyJavaNature`:\r\n\r\n1. `generatedClassPatterns` to exclude various generated code that is not annotated with nullness types\r\n2. `classesTriggerCheckerBugs` a map from classes which cannot be analyzed to their checkerframework bug URL\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

developing #13053 I discovered that some output replacements were not being re-wired correctly. The current types in output replacements would allow false misses when two `PValues` were not expanded to the same degree. Fully expanding all `PValues` to `PCollections` is always allowed, always correct, and eliminates this class of errors.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I make all the maps only allow PCollections to eliminate that class of error. I also add a bit more testing to transform replacement.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

should make it easier to configure a Flink state backend. At the moment,\r\nusers have to either:\r\n\r\n(A)  Configure the default state backend in their Flink cluster\r\n\r\n(B1) Include the dependency in their Gradle/Maven\r\n     project (e.g. \"org.apache.flink:flink-statebackend-rocksdb_2.11:$flink_version\"\r\n     for RocksDB).\r\n(B2) Set the state backend factory in the FlinkPipelineOptions. This only works\r\n     in Java due to the factory specification being in Java!\r\n\r\nWe can make it easier by simple adding pipeline options for the state backend\r\nname and the checkpoint directory which will be enough for configuring the state\r\nbackend. We bundle the RocksDB state backend by default.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Go SDK protos to use v2 of the Go protocol buffer package. This is largely behind the protos existing interfaces, and so is transparent to the SDK's use of them.\r\n\r\nThe proto option go_packages were updated to the fully qualified import names, as the usage we had was being deprecated soon. This lead to some changes to the go generate script that creates the pb.go files. We still require that the beam repo be ensconced in a github/apache folder in a developer's Go path, for proper Go SDK development, but this should be easier to handle if there are other small proto changes needed.\r\n\r\nHandles renaming the MonitoringInfos rpc from https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13078 which required small updates to harness/harness.go, this PR will be force updated once that one is in.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
