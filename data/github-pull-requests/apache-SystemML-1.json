recent commit, b43fa112c7b4ba53921e8471fdcbc3d0a15da7ae, moved the append function from MatrixBlock. After the changes, the primary benefit is sparse appends of 1.084 ms average from 1.208 avg (10  1000x100 blocks appended). More importantly, it improves the first calls before better JIT compilations set in with Q1 (quantile 1%) of 4.4 before and after 2.8 (see the table below).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are still more places to optimize the append functionality for earlier JIT compilation via specializations.\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nSU After:\r\nappending:  rows:  100 cols:  100 sp:1.0  Blocks:   1  rep: 30000  ,

patch adds a new join operator to scuro. The join operation takes two modalities as well as a join condition as input and joins the two modalities on their common dimension (temporal for now). This includes two new modalities and the ability to apply new representations on top of a joined modality. In the future the join operator will also serve as a simple alignment operator by joining two modalities by a given offset.","created_at":"2025-02-05T12:37:39Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T17:03:37Z","closed_at":"2025-02-07T17:03:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d624b2c98d9c8435c1acb213f954bb450c54ce01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/9aab9914a7291f8810c58caefef6e8e13c69f303","head":{"label":"christinadionysio:scuro_join","ref":"scuro_join","sha":"9aab9914a7291f8810c58caefef6e8e13c69f303","user":{"login":"christinadionysio","id":29162916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTYyOTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29162916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio","html_url":"https://github.com/christinadionysio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":706142619,"node_id":"R_kgDOKhbhmw","name":"systemds","full_name":"christinadionysio/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"christinadionysio","id":29162916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTYyOTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29162916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio","html_url":"https://github.com/christinadionysio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christinadionysio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/christinadionysio/systemds","description":"An

PR introduces a rewrite discovery and generation framework that supports offline systematic, random, and data-driven search strategies. Most of the changes do not affect the runtime of SystemDS. In DMLScript, I introduce an interceptor function that the framework requires for rule validation and data retrieval. With the flag -applyGeneratedRewrites, the generated rewrites in GeneratedRewriteClass are applied at runtime. To run the framework, I have provided the class RewriterFramework which can be executed on its own.\r\n\r\nI introduce a file called expressions.db that stores all extracted expressions for the data-driven search which causes the license check to fail.\r\n\r\nSorry for the large PR.\r\n\r\nHopefully this rebase succeeded as my branch was up-to-date. Anyway, I have squashed my previous commits into one.\r\n\r\n@mboehm7","created_at":"2025-02-03T08:46:36Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T20:05:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f01074382ecbd4fd04b79e175a3e5ae7f2c3e54d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/49114d6e5d9e285304ffba474d26a77e7ded55c0","head":{"label":"Jaybit0:NewRebase","ref":"NewRebase","sha":"49114d6e5d9e285304ffba474d26a77e7ded55c0","user":{"login":"Jaybit0","id":52833175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODMzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52833175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0","html_url":"https://github.com/Jaybit0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":653110430,"node_id":"R_kgDOJu2sng","name":"systemds","full_name":"Jaybit0/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jaybit0","id":52833175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODMzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52833175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0","html_url":"https://github.com/Jaybit0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaybit0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jaybit0/systemds","description":"An

10.1145/355611.362542](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/355611.362542)).\r\n\r\n**Performance:**\r\nCompared to the existing kernel, the added method provides significant performance benefits in a single-threaded context:\r\n- Faster in **82.7% of cases**.\r\n- Average speedup of **25.8%**.\r\n\r\n**Note:** \r\nPerformance measurements were restricted to cases where the existing kernel yields correct results. Similar or even better performance could be observed across all cases.\r\n\r\n**Future Work:**\r\nThe divisors operate on different indices of the array, allowing for parallelization and offering additional performance improvements in multi-threaded scenarios.\r\n\r\n@mboehm7

PR introduces a rewrite discovery and generation framework that supports offline systematic, random, and data-driven search strategies. Most of the changes do not affect the runtime of SystemDS. In `DMLScript`, I introduce an interceptor function that the framework requires for rule validation and data retrieval. With the flag `-applyGeneratedRewrites`, the generated rewrites in `GeneratedRewriteClass` are applied at runtime. To run the framework, I have provided the class `RewriterFramework` which can be executed on its own.\r\n\r\nI introduce a file called `expressions.db` that stores all extracted expressions for the data-driven search which causes the license check to fail.\r\n\r\nSorry for the large PR\r\n\r\n@mboehm7

Introduce determinant computation primitives\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the computation of the determinant of a matrix. It\r\nprovides different strategies of computing those determinants. Internally\r\nit is possible to switch between calculating the determinant using the\r\nbuiltin LU decomposition of the commons math library, Gaussian algorithm,\r\nBareiss algorithm and Laplace expansion. Furthermore, static simplification\r\nrewrites\r\n- `det(t(X)) -> det(X)`\r\n- `det(X%*%Y) -> det(X)*det(Y)`\r\n- `det(lambda*X) -> lambda^nrow(X)*det(X)`\r\n\r\nhave been implemented.\r\n\r\nAll strategies have been benchmarked using 12x12-matrices. Very large matrices\r\ncan result in the laplace algorithm to take too long. The numbers consist\r\nof the average execution time of three runs; with different matrix seeds\r\n(7, 233, 4242). Furthermore, it we distinguish between sparse and dense matrices,\r\nbecause each algorithm has its own way of optimizing for sparse matrices.\r\n- LU decomposition:\r\n\t- Total execution time (Dense matrix): 0.403\r\n\t- Total execution time (Sparse matrix): 0.056\r\n- Gaussian algorithm:\r\n\t- Total execution time (Dense matrix): 0.364\r\n\t- Total execution time (Sparse matrix): 0.049\r\n- Bareiss algorithm:\r\n\t- Total execution time (Dense matrix): 0.370\r\n\t- Total execution time (Sparse matrix): 0.054\r\n- Laplace expansion:\r\n\t- Total execution time (Dense matrix): 0.389\r\n\t- Total execution time (Sparse matrix): 6.553\r\n\r\nFurther observations:\r\n- The Laplace expansion is slow for big matrices and should not be used.\r\n- Gaussian algorithm is a bit faster than Bareiss algorithm and LU\r\ndecomposition.\r\n- Analytical observation: The Bareiss algorithm can be more accurate, if whole\r\nnumbers are used, because the divisions in the algorithm have no remainder in\r\nthat case.\r\n- Gaussian and Bareiss algorithm have larger deviations than eps if\r\nthe matrix is transposed `(det(t(X)) in R vs det(X) in SystemDS)`. The LU\r\ndecomposition does not have this issue. This could be an indicator that\r\nthe LU decomposition is more robust against floating-point errors.\r\n- The Gaussian algorithm has higher floating-point error than 1e-8 in\r\ncomparison to the equivalent implementation in R. It does not pass the\r\ntest with matrix size of around 30x30. LU decomposition and Bareiss\r\nalgorithm are suspected to have lower floating-point errors.\r\n\r\nIt is adviced to never use the laplace expansion, because of its inefficiency;\r\nthe runtime is factorial. Those observations lead to using using the\r\nLU decomposition because of its higher accuracy, despite being a bit slower\r\nthan the alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning `det(lambda*X) -> lambda^nrow(X)*det(X)` as rule is, that\r\ncomputing the power of a scalar can be done in logarithmic time, whereas\r\nthe multiplication of a scalar with a matrix is quadratic. Another reason\r\nfor this simplification are simplifications of examples such as\r\n`det(lambda*t(X)) -> lambda^nrow(X)*det(X)`, which would be harder to implement\r\nwithout this simplification.","created_at":"2025-01-29T22:54:25Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T17:59:10Z","closed_at":"2025-02-01T17:59:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/bf90dd765ee8db132071644632419dfaf9030701","head":{"label":"mike0609king:final_pr_det","ref":"final_pr_det","sha":"bf90dd765ee8db132071644632419dfaf9030701","user":{"login":"mike0609king","id":57289368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjg5MzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57289368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king","html_url":"https://github.com/mike0609king","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":898415975,"node_id":"R_kgDONYy9Zw","name":"systemds","full_name":"mike0609king/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mike0609king","id":57289368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjg5MzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57289368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king","html_url":"https://github.com/mike0609king","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike0609king/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mike0609king/systemds","description":"An

Summary\r\nAdd support for reading COGs (Cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs). It enables both sequential and parallel reading.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThis PR adds the `cog` format to the `read` function in DML. In general, any tiled TIFFs with no compression or *Deflate* compression can be read. The implementation is tested with a number of different combinations for number of tiles, bands, data types etc.\r\n\r\nAll functionality is implemented directly in Java without additional dependencies.

PR introduces a new method, computeDeterminant, implemented in the LibCommonsMath class, which provides four strategies for calculating the determinant of square matrices:\r\n\r\n1. Apache Commons Math3 LU Decomposition – a reliable and performant inbuilt method.\r\n2. Gaussian Elimination – an implementation using row reduction.\r\n3. Bareiss Algorithm – a more efficient variant of Gaussian elimination for integer matrices.\r\n4. Laplace Expansion – a recursive method primarily included for completeness and small matrices.\r\n\r\nThe first three methods provide efficient computation for matrices of varying sizes with appropriate time and memory usage. The Laplace expansion method is impractical for larger matrices due to its exponential complexity and is mainly suited for small matrices.\r\n\r\nPerformance Benchmark (Matrix 3x3) of running DetTest, Time elapsed:\r\n- Apache Commons Math3 LU Decomposition: 2.937 s\r\n- Gaussian Elimination: 2.921 s\r\n- Bareiss Algorithm: 3.023 s\r\n- Laplace Expansion: 3.425

project `SYSTEMDS-3548` and follow-up to #2154 \r\n\r\nContributions/discussion:\r\n\r\n- I did some follow-up to both suggestions from @Baunsgaard in the first PR and did testing with both chunking into smaller parts and fusing operations into fewer java calls. I was unable to get any real improvements that were replicable over the larger datasets, altough I don't have a ton of experience with Py4J, so this might still have some potential. I added some of the adjacent code for it though (fusing convert, setting only chunks of a FrameBlock etc.), so at least some of the work I did there contributes to the project.\r\n- As it turns out, anything involving the java gateway is super costly, so for example even simply doing a `if var == jvm.gate.sds.ValueType.String` comparison has a big overhead. I was able to optimize another constant time by reducing stuff like that to a minimum, see the first graph below.\r\n- For cases where `cols > rows` the current column-wise processing is very slow, so I added row-wise processing for that case to speed it up (see second graph below, tested on 1k rows x 10k cols). Note here that it currently only does that for edge cases where all columns have the same data type. This is because when testing, serializing over a row with different columns was very costly. I wasn't able to spend a lot of time on this, as the deadline is approaching, so I think there is a lot of potential here to find an efficient way to serialize to be able to also use it for mixed columns. I'd also expect in the most optimal case for the time to be the same as as the `rows > cols` case, so I think there is probably also more optimization potential in the current row-wise processing.\r\n- Small note that I switched how I compared times, before I was averaging runs but now I take the min as suggested by the [timeit docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#timeit.Timer.repeat), so times might be slightly different from the first PR.\r\n- Fixed a regression from my first PR where exceptions in the threaded function calls wouldn't propagate properly.\r\n- Fixed a small bug in the perftests to be able to read multi-file data (since that's what datagen generates for larger

Summary\r\nAdding counter based RNG which improves random quality and speed\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nThe PRNG uses Philox4x64_10 to generate batches of random double values with a 64 bit randomness. The algorithm was tested for correctness by comparing its output for certain counters and keys with an existing implementation in c.\r\nThis reference implementation called [openRAND](https://github.com/msu-sparta/OpenRAND) was tested by the authors using various statistical methods described [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711024001444).\r\n\r\n## Advantages\r\n- Quality: Instead of 32 bits in java.util.Random, Philox4_64 produces 64 bits of randomness. While java.util.Random has a period of only (2^48), while the period of Philox4_64 is 2^256 - 1. \r\n- Speed: While the Java version of Philox4x64_10 is only about half as fast as java.util.Random, there is a Cuda kernel version available producing the exact same sequence of random numbers. This means that the Cuda and Java versions can be used interchangeably. If a system has support for Cuda, the kernel ist used, if not, the Java version can be used as a fallback. The kernel version is around 200 times faster than java.util.Random, and even faster, if the results are not copied to the CPU but kept in the GPU's memory.\r\n- Parallelisation: When using state based PRNGs, it is impossible to generate the same random matrix when changing the block size. With counter based PRNGs it is possible to change the block size but still compute the same random matrix by using the global index (row * row_size + col) as the

Summary\r\nAn initial version of the recursive function for finding the optimal plan in a `DMLProgram` has been implemented. This design is based on `FederatedPlannerFedAll`. This PR addresses a different topic from the previous one (https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2175), despite being related, so it has been created separately.\r\n\r\nThe currently implemented functionalities are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Recursive traversal (enumeration?) of `StatementBlock` and `Statement` within the program.\r\n- Identification of the optimal federated plan (`FedPlan`) for each `Statement` (limited to individual statements, not the entire program).\r\n\r\nHowever, the current implementation does not yet support:\r\n- Integration and identification of the optimal `FedPlan` and `MemoTable` at the `StatementBlock` or program level.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Questions for Discussion\r\n\r\n### 1. Recursive Integration of Optimal FedPlans and MemoTables Across Statements and StatementBlocks\r\n- Should the same dynamic programming approach be used for integration?\r\n- Or would simply summing up the minimal plans of each block/statement suffice?\r\n\r\n### 2. MemoTable Sharing\r\n- Is there a need to share the MemoTable? \r\n- Are there data/hop dependencies between statements?\r\n\r\n### 3. Prediction of Iteration Counts for Loops (For and While)\r\nHow should the iteration counts for loops be determined?\r\n- If from/to/increment are constants: Calculations can be done at compile time.\r\n- If they are variables: Use default values at compile time, adjust at runtime, or predict using ML models.\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-20T17:28:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T17:42:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/8f7451f1633fbd96da4c4a31777edbf73f164f47","head":{"label":"min-guk:future","ref":"future","sha":"8f7451f1633fbd96da4c4a31777edbf73f164f47","user":{"login":"min-guk","id":87025898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI1ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87025898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk","html_url":"https://github.com/min-guk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":861717504,"node_id":"R_kgDOM1zEAA","name":"systemds","full_name":"min-guk/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"min-guk","id":87025898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI1ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87025898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk","html_url":"https://github.com/min-guk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/min-guk/systemds","description":"An

patch enables the DML to print matrices and other datatypes (frame, list)  without using the toString() method.\r\nPreviously, printing a matrix A required: `print(toString(A))`.\r\nNow, printing can be done via: `print(A)`.\r\nThe same applies to frames and lists. However, there are some remaining issues when datastructures are used with indexing. For example, while `A[1,]` is also a matrix (first row of A), `print(A[1,])` will not print the correct output (first row) but rather only the first element of the first row. Internally, the compiler misinterprets the matrix as a scalar and does not propagate the correct size information. The propagated size information on the rewrite-level are (-1 x -1), meaning unknown. A work-around would be either to still use the `toString` method or, as shown in the test cases, to materialize the slicing before printing: `B=A[1,]` , `print(B)`.\r\nSimilar problems exist with lists and frames but can be addressed by materializing the slicing/indexing outside the print as shown in the previous example. A future task should address this issue. \r\nI promoted the rewrite from RewriteAlgebraicSimplificationStatic to having a separate class in the rewrite directory as discussed. Testing has been added.

Implementation Summary\r\n- Added functionality to detect conflicts in **OptimalFedPlan**, where specific **FedPlans (Hops)** have different **FedOutputTypes**.\r\n- The **OptimalFedPlan** is traversed from top to bottom using a **BFS** approach to detect conflicts.\r\n- Conflicts are resolved locally, even when one child has multiple parents, with **network costs** calculated only once.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\nThe current implementation has the following limitations:\r\n1. It cannot guarantee either an **optimal cost plan** or a **suboptimal plan**.\r\n2. Changes to the **local cost** affect all nodes up to the root, but these nodes are **not updated**.\r\n3. **OptimalFedPlan** must be **traversed again** to search for conflicts.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach works, exploring better solutions to address these issues would be valuable.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n1. Is it acceptable for the **compute cost** and **memory access cost** calculations for **Federated Workers** and the **Local Coordinator** to remain the same?\r\n2. Could you provide more specific examples of scenarios where our **OptimalFedPlan** calculations are effective or where conflicts occur?\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n1. Develop **test code workloads** to simulate scenarios where conflicts arise.\r\n2. Write and validate **test code in a federated environment**.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-08T08:23:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T09:51:45Z","closed_at":"2025-01-25T09:51:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b792a1f79d8e6cd1bbdd799b33b50c350aaef02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/8ec140eb27d598d041cdddcd7119e07018771e2f","head":{"label":"min-guk:main","ref":"main","sha":"8ec140eb27d598d041cdddcd7119e07018771e2f","user":{"login":"min-guk","id":87025898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI1ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87025898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk","html_url":"https://github.com/min-guk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":861717504,"node_id":"R_kgDOM1zEAA","name":"systemds","full_name":"min-guk/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"min-guk","id":87025898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI1ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87025898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk","html_url":"https://github.com/min-guk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/min-guk/systemds","description":"An

PR introduces multi-head attention layers as a built in layer with forward and backward pass.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe multi-head attention layer is the base layer of all most Transformer models, with many variations for different models. This implementation is in-line with the basic BERT attention layer. The functionality is currently kept to a minimum without features like attention masking, head masking, cross-attention, etc.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- New testing module was implemented specifically for this layer, extending automated testing base\r\n- Tests execute forward/backward pass with given inputs and compares outputs against expected outputs\r\n- Implementation is compared against HuggingFace Transformer library implementation\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first in a number of PRs in an effort to support the BERT model in SystemDS and other transformer models in the future.

patch disentangles the loading mechanisms of raw data from the representations and contains rewrites of the Modality data structure. It adds a base loader that can be extended for every modality type and needs to be adapted according to the file structure of the raw data. Additionally, the modality  data structure was reworked to enable stacking of operations. This includes slight API changes and the introduction of `.apply_representation()` and `.combine()` methods. Individual modality types are replaced by a universal `UnimodalModality` that takes a `ModalityType` to indicate the original modality of the data.

have implemented FederatedPlanCostEstimator, FederatedPlanCostEnumerator, and FederatedMemoTable.\r\n\r\nHowever, this implementation differs significantly from the coding direction we discussed in the meeting, so we need detailed discussion about the implementation direction in the next meeting.\r\n\r\nPlease review my thoughts and advise if my understanding is correct.\r\n\r\n## 1. FederatedMemoTable (MemoTable)\r\n```java\r\npublic class MemoTable {\r\n        private final Map<Pair<Long, FTypes.FType>, List<FedPlan>> hopMemoTable = new HashMap<>();\r\n\r\n\tpublic static class FedPlan {\r\n\t\t@SuppressWarnings(\"unused\")\r\n\t\tprivate final Hop hopRef;                       // The associated Hop object\r\n\t\tprivate final double cost;                      // Cost of this federated plan\r\n\t\t@SuppressWarnings(\"unused\")\r\n\t\tprivate final List<Pair<Long, FType>> planRefs;\t// References to dependent plans\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe previous FedPlan class structure had several issues:\r\n- A single <HopID, FederatedOutput> pair stored multiple FedPlans as a list in the MemoTable, redundantly storing the hopRef.\r\n- A single <HopID, FederatedOutput> pair had to calculate its computeCost and accessCost 2^(planRefs+1) times redundantly.\r\n- FedPlan did not store its own FederatedOutput\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class FederatedMemoTable {\r\n    private final Map<Pair<Long, FederatedOutput>, FedPlanVariants> hopMemoTable = new HashMap<>();\r\n\r\n    public static class FedPlanVariants {\r\n        protected final Hop hopRef;         // Reference to the associated Hop\r\n        protected double currentCost;       // Current execution cost (compute + memory access)\r\n        protected double netTransferCost;   // Network transfer cost\r\n        protected List<FedPlan> _fedPlanVariants;  \r\n    }\r\n    public static class FedPlan {\r\n        private double cumulativeCost;                  // Total cost including child plans\r\n        private final FederatedOutput fedOutType;       // Output type (FOUT/LOUT)\r\n        private final FedPlanVariants fedPlanVariantList;  // Reference to variant list\r\n        private List<Pair<Long, FederatedOutput>> metaChildFedPlans;  // Child plan references\r\n        private List<FedPlan> selectedFedPlans;           // Selected child plans\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe key points of the redesigned FederatedMemoTable are as follows:\r\n- A single <HopID, FederatedOutput> pair has one FedPlanVariants, which stores and shares the redundant hopRef, currentCost, and netTransferCost with FedPlans stored in fedPlanVariants.\r\n- A single <HopID, FederatedOutput> pair calculates its computeCost and accessCost only once.\r\n- FedPlan stores its own FederatedOutput.\r\n\r\n## 2. CostEstimator\r\n```java\r\n    // Do not create and allocate any new FedPlan.\r\n    // just calculate the cost for given fed plans.\r\n    // cost of dependent fedplans in planRefs is already calculated.\r\n    public static void computeFederatedPlanCost(FedPlan currentPlan, FederatedMemoTable memoTable){\r\n        double cost = computeFederatedPlanCost(currentPlan.getHopRef());\r\n\r\n        for (Pair<Long, FederatedOutput> planRefMeta: currentPlan.getPlanRefs()){\r\n            FedPlan planRef = memoTable.getFedPlan(planRefMeta.getLeft(), planRefMeta.getRight());\r\n            cost += planRef.getCost();\r\n\r\n            if (currentPlan.getFedOutType() != planRef.getFedOutType()){\r\n                cost += computeHopNetworkAccessCost(planRef.getHopRef().getOutputMemEstimate());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        currentPlan.setCost(cost);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe previous CostEstimator also had several issues:\r\n- It calculates the currentHop's cost every time.\r\n- The Optimal FedPlan should minimize the total cost of compute, memory access, and network access.\r\n- However, the previous CostEstimator selects the ref plan with minimum cost excluding network cost, and then adds network cost afterward, so it cannot guarantee the minimum cost FedPlan.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static void computeFederatedPlanCost(FedPlan currentPlan, FederatedMemoTable memoTable) {\r\n        double cumulativeCost = 0;\r\n        Hop currentHop = currentPlan.getHopRef();\r\n\r\n        // Step 1: Calculate current node costs if not already computed\r\n        if (currentPlan.getCurrentCost() == 0) {\r\n            // Compute cost for current node (computation + memory access)\r\n            cumulativeCost = computeCurrentCost(currentHop);\r\n            currentPlan.setCurrentCost(cumulativeCost);\r\n            // Calculate potential network transfer cost if federation type changes\r\n            currentPlan.setNetTransferCost(computeHopNetworkAccessCost(currentHop.getOutputMemEstimate()));\r\n        } else {\r\n            cumulativeCost = currentPlan.getCurrentCost();\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        // Step 2: Process each child plan and add their costs\r\n        for (Pair<Long, FederatedOutput> planRefMeta : currentPlan.getMetaChildFedPlans()) {\r\n            // Find minimum cost child plan considering federation type compatibility\r\n            // Note: This approach might lead to suboptimal or wrong solutions when a child has multiple parents\r\n            // because we're selecting child plans independently for each parent\r\n            FedPlan planRef = memoTable.getMinCostChildFedPlan(\r\n                    planRefMeta.getLeft(), planRefMeta.getRight(), currentPlan.getFedOutType());\r\n\r\n            // Add child plan cost (includes network transfer cost if federation types differ)\r\n            cumulativeCost += planRef.getParentViewCost(currentPlan.getFedOutType());\r\n            \r\n            // Store selected child plan\r\n            // Note: Selected plan has minimum parent view cost, not minimum cumulative cost,\r\n            // which means it highly unlikely to be found through simple pruning after enumeration\r\n            currentPlan.putChildFedPlan(planRef);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        // Step 3: Set final cumulative cost including current node\r\n        currentPlan.setCumulativeCost(cumulativeCost);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe key points of the redesigned CostEstimator are as follows:\r\n- It calculates the compute cost and access cost of currentHop only once per HopID.\r\n- When selecting the minimum cost ref plan, it selects the ref plan including network cost, ensuring minimum total cost.\r\n- It stores selected child plans in a list as pointers.\r\n  - This is because when pruning all at once in the memotable later, we cannot calculate network cost without knowing the fOutType of each fedplan's parent fedplan, so we cannot identify the optimal cost plan. Therefore, pruning in the current MemoTable has been removed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current CostEstimator may cause two problems because it selects child plans based only on the cost of a single current plan and child plan:\r\n1. A child plan can have multiple parent plans, and different parent plans can select different child plans. Therefore, a child plan could form a non-existent fed plan with different fOutTypes.\r\n2. Since a child plan can have multiple parent plans, it should select the fOutType that minimizes the sum of costs of all parent plans referencing it. Otherwise, it may select a suboptimal plan.\r\n  - We need to devise a new algorithm to solve these two problems.\r\n\r\n## 3. FederatedPlanCostEnumerator \r\n```java\r\npublic class FederatedPlanCostEnumerator {\r\n    public static FedPlan enumerateFederatedPlanCost(Hop rootHop) {              \r\n        FederatedMemoTable memoTable = new FederatedMemoTable();\r\n        enumerateFederatedPlanCost(rootHop, memoTable);\r\n        return getMinCostRootFedPlan(rootHop.getHopID(), memoTable);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Recursively enumerates all possible federated execution plans for a Hop DAG.\r\n     * For each node:\r\n     * 1.

patch extends the bag-of-words operation to support transform apply and the distributed spark backend.\r\n\r\nTo support the bow encoder for sparse outputs I had to adapt the OutputMatrixPreProcessing step in the transform apply framework, since we need to know the number of non-zero values per row when allocating the output sparse matrix. This is easy for the other encoders, since they resulted in just one non-zero value per encoder.\r\nIn transform encode we gained this information about the number of non-zeroes in the Build phase. Since we don't have a build phase in transform apply, we don't dont have this information. To solve this issue, I added a simplified build-like phase in the  OutputMatrixPreProcessing, which computes the #nnz for each bow encoder, if the output is sparse and the transformation involves a bow encoder. This phase is parallelized across the bow encoder columns.\r\nThe decision if the output is sparse is based on an estimation of the total #nnz of bow encoder, which is calculated based on a sample of the input. \r\n\r\nIn one of the spark test cases, where I cbind the input frame with itself before executing the transform encode, I encountered an alignment issue while the map-based frame append, which I could bypass for now by adding a breaker (while(FALSE). I am investigating the bug in a separate

PR introduces the implementation of a `MemoTable` to identify the Federated Plan with the optimal cost using dynamic programming in the Federated Planner. Currently, since the Cost Estimator has not yet been implemented, the behavior of some methods and exception handling logic might differ from expectations.\r\n\r\nOnce the Cost Estimator is completed, the MemoTable logic will be revisited and refined to ensure greater robustness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIf you have any specific directions or additional feedback, please feel free to share them at any time.

test code for FED Privacy, which was previously removed in commit d9822ce9c7eb26412c00cbcaf0decc11e02ae533, has been restored. Moving forward, we plan to implement FED Privacy features incrementally in a bottom-up approach and aim to pass each of these test cases one by one as the functionality is developed.\r\n\r\n- Currently, all FED Privacy implementations have been removed, and as a result, the restored test code cannot be compiled or executed at this stage. \r\n- Instead of using the `@Ignore` annotation for the tests, all restored test code has been commented out to avoid build or runtime issues.\r\n\r\nThis pull request focuses solely on restoring the test code for future development and testing

GitHub Action will use the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/wrapper\">Codecov Wrapper</a> to encapsulate the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli\">CLI</a>. This will help ensure that the Action gets updates quicker.</p>\n<h3>Migration Guide</h3>\n<p>The <code>v5</code> release also coincides with the opt-out feature for tokens for public repositories. In the repository settings page in codecov.io, you can set the ability for Codecov to receive a coverage report from ANY souce. This will allow contributors or other members of a repository to upload without needing access to the Codecov token.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!WARNING]<br />\n<strong>The following arguments have been

implementation of the CovarianceFEDInstruction worked correctly only for regular federated covariance. The following issues were discovered when tested for the weighted covariance case:\r\n1. In the processCov method the value to the wtBlock variable was assigned incorrectly, as input2 which is the second input matrix was used instead of the weights matrix stored as input3. Moreover, the slice method should be called for wtBlock as well when passed as an argument to the executeFederatedOperation method.\r\n2. The processMean method was implemented incorrectly for the case of weighted covariance. In its previous implementation it modified the original instruction string so as to execute the uamean instruction. However, in order to calculate weighted covariance weighted mean is required. Therefore, the method was substantially modified to make sure the proper mean values are calculated.\r\n3. The aggregation of partial results from the federated workers was not implemented properly. To begin with, in the getResponses method mean values were collected only from the second and third federated worker. Then, in the aggCov method the implementation did not support the aggregation of weighted means, since in this case the sum of weights should be employed instead of vector lengths per worker. Both methods were modified to ensure the correct aggregation of covariance.","created_at":"2024-11-13T12:26:39Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T09:22:42Z","closed_at":"2024-11-17T11:34:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9b1090890d02dbbdd8e85ec05035d53c9f7a05f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2137/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2137/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2137/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/2aa5bd9d5901e3a4599a9a12fb558eda7084a278","head":{"label":"gaturchenko:dev","ref":"dev","sha":"2aa5bd9d5901e3a4599a9a12fb558eda7084a278","user":{"login":"gaturchenko","id":70841338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODQxMzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70841338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko","html_url":"https://github.com/gaturchenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":870550159,"node_id":"R_kgDOM-OKjw","name":"systemds","full_name":"gaturchenko/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaturchenko","id":70841338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODQxMzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70841338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko","html_url":"https://github.com/gaturchenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaturchenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaturchenko/systemds","description":"An

PR adds a new builtin function for ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) for generating synthetic data in case of class imbalances in ML datasets (binary classification). The method itself is implemented but I still need to add the test class in java. I manually tested the method on a real dataset called [Pima Indians Diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which the authors also used in the original paper. The generated synthetic data looked very reasonable when compared to the original data. I will make a more detailed description here once I added the test cases and conducted more experiments on the other datasets mentioned in the paper.

PR is just a supplement to a previous task and implements the Sparse CSC Block. MCSC and CSC will most likely only be used for some experiments (@Baunsgaard ) and there will not be a deeper integration for now. Other systems such as PyTorch support both row and column oriented matrix compression formats and now SystemDS does too. I implemented both the row and the column APIs. Further, testing has been added.

Bag-of-words Encoder for CP\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new feature transformation Bag-of-words (bow) to the to SystemDS' parallel feature transformation framework UPLIFT. The Bag-of-words encoder works similarly to scikit-learn's CountVectorizor ( https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html ). \r\n\r\nCurrently, the operation is only supported for CP. I had to adapt the framework a little bit, because the bow encoders behaves differently than other encoders and can create multiple non-zero values from a single input column. In comparison, encoders like Dummycode (dc) create more columns, but result always in just one non-zero value from each dc encoder. So, when a bow encoders is involved, the nnz values for each row is not known upfront, which is problematic for a parallel apply with CSR matrix output.\r\nI added a new field in the ColumnEncoder which contains the nnz for each row, which is known after the build is completed.\r\n\r\nThe encoding, consists again of two phases the build, where we find the number of distinct tokens in the column and an apply phase, where we count the occurrences of each distinct token in each row.\r\n\r\nFor a parallelised build phase, we need to know the number of distinct tokens to avoid OOM errors through many large dictionaries. Similarly to recode, we estimate the number of distinct tokens of the bow dictionary, by sampling from a subset of rows. In contrast, this estimation is computational more complex for each row than for recode through the whole tokenisation process. A small experimental evaluation showed that the estimation took significantly longer for bow in comparison to recode, but in the end did not make up more than 10% of the whole encoding process.\r\nOne option to tackle this, would be to increase the number of samples for the bow encoder, but this resulted in (significantly) higher error of the estimation.\r\n\r\nOverall the parallelisation of a single bow encoder over row partitions showed good improvements in runtime (3.4x with 4 physical cores) for the amazon digital music review dataset (131k reviews, 8m tokens,127k distinct tokens).\r\n- single-threaded encoder: 2.5s\r\n- multi-threaded encoder: 0.73s\r\n- scikit-learn's CountVectorizer: 3s\r\n\r\nThe default tokenisation consists of the conversion to lowercase, replacing of all non-alphabetic characters to whitespaces and splitting on whitespaces. \r\n\r\nThe current technique makes two passes over the data (build + apply), which could be avoided by storing the count of distinct token counts of the build phase, and just setting the values correctly in the apply phase. But this results, in a much higher memory footprint, since we have to store additionally for each row a hashmap of token count. \r\nA next step could be to estimate the memory consumption of this
