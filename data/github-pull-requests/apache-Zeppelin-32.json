What is this PR for?\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**1. The purpose of this PR is introducing webpack to zeppelin-web**\r\n\r\n- It supports super-fast javascript compilation and (hot) reload\r\n- It helps to simplify, unify build process.\r\n- It enables for us to use `import`, `export` features.\r\n- It's more modern stack than grunt. This will encourage other developers to contribute (*the most import thing IMO*).\r\n\r\n**2. This PR is designed to improve build process _gradually!!!_**\r\n\r\n- So, Angular module loading depends on the import sequence as we did before in [index.html](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-web/src/index.html#L171). (see [index.js](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1805/files#diff-a128f4667c7e1afb6058389c20627b4e)). \r\n- Also, CSS and HTML file is not managed by webpack including its live reloading\r\n\r\n*These will be handled by additional PRs.*\r\n\r\n**3. This PR is not big**\r\n\r\n- 60+ file changes are just about removing `use strict`, importing `zeppelin.js`. (Also includes fixups for #1802 and #1803)\r\n- So skip them while reveiw\r\n- Please focus on the changes in `Gruntfile.js`, `package.json`, `webpack.config.js`\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Setup webpack.config.js\r\n* [x] - Resolve global variable `zeppelin` problem\r\n* [x] - Support webpack in karma (`npm run test`)\r\n* [x] - Annotate the result bundle using webpack ng annotate plugin\r\n* [x] - Fix eslint violations\r\n* [x] - Livereload for HTML, CSS\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1850)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n- `cd zeppelin-web && rm -rf node_modules bower_components node`\r\n- `npm install`\r\n- `npm run test`\r\n- `npm run build`\r\n- `npm run dev` and open `localhost:9000`: **check live-reload works regarding to html, css, js files**\r\n- `cd .. && mvn clean package -pl 'zeppelin-web' -DskipTests &&  ./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart` and open `localhost:8080`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? - NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? - NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation? -

What is this PR for?\r\nCustomizing the Zeppelin Homepage to show the notebook list does not work as [0.6.2 document](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.2/manuala/notebookashomepage.html#show-notebooks-list-in-your-custom-homepage). Furthermore, it is not working on 0.7.0 version ([0.7.0 document](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/manual/notebookashomepage.html#show-notes-list-in-your-custom-homepage)). \r\n\r\nThat reason is that get_home message of zeppelin websocket is called in zeppelin-web twice.\r\n\r\nAt this chance, I suggest to split role to HomeCtrl and CustomHomeCtrl because when \"Home.controller.js\" is update, It could be conflicted like current issue.\r\nSo I think it would be more convenient to manage the roles separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix |  Feature | Documentation ]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* None\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1578\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- After write the following code in paragraph, run it.\r\n```\r\nprintln(\r\n\"\"\"%angular\r\n  <div ng-include=\"'app/home/notebook.html'\"></div>\r\n\"\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![homepage_custom_notebook_list](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8110458/22372221/c34242a2-e4de-11e6-9506-8c354b57c1c4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nCode based workflow (**work in progress**)\r\n\r\nRe-implementation on this pr\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1176\r\n\r\n```\r\nif

process feature.\r\n(To ensure the success of each paragraph, it is possible to run consecutively.)\r\n#### Case 1\r\nPlease check the following flowchart.\r\n![workflowdynamicformcontrol](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16791726/a4b96ff0-48fc-11e6-8e23-9ec577066bb7.png)\r\n#### Case 2\r\n\r\nIn general, when run a plurality of Paragraph, it performs Note entire run.\r\nThis is a good way to run a lot of Paragraph contained in the Note.\r\nHowever, the problem occurs if the Interpreter of Paragraph different.\r\n![notebook_example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16803203/175ad01a-4940-11e6-8949-72d0c49bdf9e.png)\r\nFor Paragraph each using a different type of one of the Interpreter Note but run in sequence, the end is all different.\r\n\r\n![normal notebook run](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16803193/069c4d94-4940-11e6-9293-888b6c6288a0.png)\r\nFor example, Markdown is a very fast Interpreter.\r\nThe process is completed very quickly.\r\nThis is a problem in the sequential execution Paragraph.\r\n\r\n![worklfow run](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16803192/06998122-4940-11e6-8f01-43cdf64f2eef.png)\r\nThis feature ensures a certain execution order Notebook with each Interpreter.\r\n##### Case 3\r\n\r\nFor concurrent job in the workflow ...\r\n\r\n![job_repl](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16828860/96e601b8-49ce-11e6-87d0-6f7fc30ce751.png)\r\n\r\nIf the current functional design is supposed to run at the same time, as follows \r\nIt is to share the results of the job.\r\nBut if the situation need to run the job at the same time, subject to their execution flow.\r\n\r\n*\\* The results will have to succeed, the following paragraph will be executed. **\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n###

What is this PR for?\r\nJob class has only two sub classes. I don't think we need Job abstraction class anymore, then I'll move all function of Job into Paragraph and InterpretJob. Paragraph is used into zeppelin-server and InterpretJob is done by remoteInterpreterServer. I think what we disconnect those two different classes is better to maintain each side of codes. This PR moves two variable - result and results - from Job to Paragraph in order to remove Job class. It also based on ZEPPELIN-1594(#1753), thus all reviewers click the last commit and review it.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Moved these variables into Paragraph\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nAll things are same as before\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n\r\nDepInterpreterTest will use random temporary folder for repo\r\n\r\n`DefaultRepositorySystem.resolveDependencies` throws NPE at line 352\r\nif `ArtifactResolutionException` is thrown during `collectDependencies`.\r\nArtifact is found but it is impossible to download it (for example folder\r\ncan't be created)\r\n\r\nI think the reason is that several tests use \"local-repo\" folder for repository.\r\nWhile one test tries to download artifact, another deletes repository\r\n(or some another distructive thing)","created_at":"2016-12-19T10:52:07Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T09:35:28Z","closed_at":"2017-01-19T00:49:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e922c458968e1ed08a874a22b86603dc7dd7d19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1782/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1782/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1782/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/a2af13583f0f5be975e9f1780140d683a66d3983","head":{"label":"DrIgor:ZEPPELIN-1837","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1837","sha":"a2af13583f0f5be975e9f1780140d683a66d3983","user":{"login":"DrIgor","id":2759002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTkwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2759002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor","html_url":"https://github.com/DrIgor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76329731,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjMyOTczMQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"DrIgor/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DrIgor","id":2759002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTkwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2759002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor","html_url":"https://github.com/DrIgor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrIgor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DrIgor/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nZeppelin currently has little functionality for data source exploration. This PR exists to build a small feature for the JDBC interpreter that would allow users to explore metadata for databases and database objects.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the JDBC interpreter accepts the \"explore\" keyword. When run in isolation, this fetches metadata about the database as a whole (tables, views etc...). When the explore keyword is followed by the name of a table or view, this fetches metadata about that table or view (column names, data types etc...).\r\n\r\nA video of this feature in action can be found here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots-mockups/embedvid.html).\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement | Feature\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1824\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Run `explore` in a `%jdbc` paragraph to get a list of tables, views, system tables, global and local temporary tables, aliases and synonyms.\r\n\r\n2. Run `explore` followed by the name of a database table or view in order to get a list of column names, data types etc...\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR adds two new unit tests to `JDBCInterpreterTest` which test fetching of database metadata as well as table and view metadata.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots-mockups/embedvid.html\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes. This would benefit from a small addition to the JDBC Interpreter documentation.\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-16T09:31:41Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:28Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96df5472fc97bd7208d7bede73e4f2da306698f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1776/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1776/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1776/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/6a6c7adc65cf50f169a4e0f1e8a0275f426cda8a","head":{"label":"pmccaffrey6:jdbc-metadata","ref":"jdbc-metadata","sha":"6a6c7adc65cf50f169a4e0f1e8a0275f426cda8a","user":{"login":"pmccaffrey6","id":1152797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTI3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6","html_url":"https://github.com/pmccaffrey6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76598200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjU5ODIwMA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"pmccaffrey6/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pmccaffrey6","id":1152797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTI3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6","html_url":"https://github.com/pmccaffrey6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmccaffrey6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pmccaffrey6/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently we can select default interpreter when we create a new note like below.\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-15 at 4 41 15 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21215571/56bf4078-c2e5-11e6-8455-b2cb0e126007.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, even if we don't set the default interpreter(don't select any interpreters) in this dialog and just create new note, the default interpreter is automatically set as `Spark` interpreter. This can be checked in the interpreter binding page. It doesn't make sense I think. \r\nSo I removed `--select--` and set the default option in the select box with `Spark` as the interpreter binding page does. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Build only web \\w `npm run build` under `zeppelin-web/` and run `npm run start` for dev mode. \r\n2. Create a new note and see the select box \r\n\r\nor just see the below screenshots :)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n - Before

What is this PR for?\r\nThe changes in the fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1319 introduced a bug which makes setting path to keystore and truststore impossible from zeppelin-site.xml.\r\nThe reason seems to be an incorrect use of getString() here\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1319/files#diff-69b17249ac9d265091d730130d973f4aR282 \r\nand here\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1319/files#diff-69b17249ac9d265091d730130d973f4aR311\r\nThere should be no getString there, just \"path\" as it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nHot Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1810\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nBefore this fix:\r\nIn `zeppelin-site.xml`\r\n* setting `zeppelin.ssl` to `true`\r\n* setting `zeppelin.ssl.keystore.path` to a relative path to a keystore (technically it doens't have to exist at all)\r\n* setting `zeppelin.ssl.truststore.path` to a relative path to a truststore Zeppelin \r\n\r\nNow Zeppelin won't start. In the log you can read something like\r\n```WARN [2016-12-14 13:55:45,522] ({main} AbstractLifeCycle.java[setFailed]:212) - FAILED SslContextFactory@8f2098e(/home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null,/home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null): java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null (No such file or directory)```\r\n\r\nWith this fix the correct path is resolved\r\n\r\nEdit: Proof reading and formatting fixes\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n\r\n- added Dockerfiles for released zeppelin binaries (0.6.0, 0.6.1, 0.6.2)\r\n- refactored Dockerfiles `scripts/docker/zeppelin-base` so that we can keep small

discussed in this PR\r\n\r\n1. **Support other linux (centos) or not:** Alpine linux is designed for light weight OS so it doesn't have graphic devices. But usually people use zeppelin to render graph like things. In this case Alpine is not enough\r\n2. **Extracting scripts to installing required packages into `testing/install_external_dependencies.sh` or not:** Alpine linux has it's own command to install packages like `apk add`. I think this is not reusable. And extracting scripts from Dockerfile causes other problems. For example, we need to add script just for building base images for python, r to copy scripts for external dependencies because Docker command `COPY` and `ADD` doens't support relative paths. It means, we have to copy external dependency scripts before building into the path where Dockerfile is built.\r\n3. **Including git to base images or not**: I am not sure git is used in zeppelin as default. It will increase the size of base images about 20MB.\r\n4. **Adding Binary Zeppelin Image to [docker-library/official-images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/)**: I haven't experiences about this.\r\n5. We can reduced size by removing packages such as googleVis, data.table and ramnathv/rCharts in R images for example.

I am not sure whether this is a problem of zeppelin or spark.\r\n- Since alpine linux doesn't have graphical device, some function may not work (e.g plot in R). Some R examples throw invalid images like chunked.png\r\n- For the same reason, we have to change some code of **Python - matplotlib basic** before testing otherwise it will throw tkinter errors in the python interpreter\r\n\r\n```python\r\n// before\r\n%python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\n// should be\r\n%python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib\r\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pet\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run each zeppelin container and run tutorial while replacing tags by accessing localhost:8080 in your browsers\r\n\r\n```\r\n# run: Zeppelin Tutorial\r\n$ docker run -it --name zeppelin --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 7077:7077 zeppelin:alpine-0.6.2_java\r\n\r\n# run: Zeppelin Tutorial, Python - matplotlib basic\r\n# and modify the code mentioned above before running paragraphs\r\n$ docker run -it --name zeppelin --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 7077:7077 zeppelin:alpine-0.6.2_python\r\n\r\n# run: Zeppelin Tutorial,  R Tutorial\r\n$ docker run -it --name zeppelin --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 7077:7077 zeppelin:alpine-0.6.2_r\r\n\r\n# test 0.6.1, 0.6.0 containers too\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Testing `create-dockerfile.sh`\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ scripts/docker/zeppelin-bin-all/create-dockerfile.sh -h \r\n\r\nUSAGE: ./create-dockerfile.sh version linux platform\r\n* version: 0.6.2 (released zeppelin binary version)\r\n* linux: [alpine]\r\n* platform: [java, python, r]\r\n\r\n# For example,\r\n# This command will create `scripts/docker/zeppelin-bin-all/alpine/0.7.0_java/Dockerfile\r\n$ ./create-dockerfile.sh 0.7.0 alpine java\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n#### Image Sizes\r\n\r\nzeppelin base image size added in #1538: 301.3 MB\r\n\r\n```\r\nREPOSITORY               TAG                   IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-base_java      5a24572968d6        5 hours ago         145 MB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-base_python    e41dcf04760b        4 hours ago         684.9 MB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-base_r         80c2d7aa7156        4 hours ago         538.9 MB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.0_java     85b4502fd255        2 hours ago         737.7 MB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.0_python   709dc585b94c        2 hours ago         1.278 GB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.0_r        f6fba0c66563        2 hours ago         1.131 GB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.1_java     ed95ca6204a9        3 hours ago         751.3 MB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.1_python   34ceea2aeba8        3 hours ago         1.291 GB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.1_r        3886596f3759        3 hours ago         1.145 GB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.2_java     c65b2f6a1128        3 hours ago         786.4 MB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.2_python   16c2c3630545        3 hours ago         1.326 GB\r\nzeppelin                 alpine-0.6.2_r        544311ec1e6a        3 hours ago         1.18 GB\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can reduced size by removing packages such as `googleVis`, `data.table` and `ramnathv/rCharts` in R images for example.

needs documentation? - YES, I updated

What is this PR for?\r\nThere are lots of use cases that need to know each `Paragraph Id` in Zeppelin. \r\ne.g. [run paragraph using rest api](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/rest-api/rest-notebook.html#run-a-paragraph-asynchronously) / [`z.angularBind`](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/displaysystem/front-end-angular.html#basic-usage) / [export paragraphs using iframe](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/manual/publish.html) ...\r\n\r\nSo I added `Copy to clipboard` btn next the each `Paragraph Id` under paragraph setting menu using [angular-zeroclipboard](https://github.com/lisposter/angular-zeroclipboard). \r\nIt'll be useful even if it's small feature :)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement | Feature \r\n\r\n###

to start dev mode and browse `http://localhost:9000`\r\n3. click gear icon placed top of the each paragraph -> hover the mouse on the paragraph id \r\n4. click it and paste the paragraph id to

What is this PR for?\r\nThe matplotlib tests have stalled as a result of conda downloading version 2.0.0b1. While this was an old beta version and the issue has been fixed upstream (https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock/issues/86), we still have not tested the inline backend for 2.0.0 which will be a release with a lot of major changes, hence this PR should be made anyway. I am also partially undoing one of the changes made in #1709 which suppressed the output of the dependency installation from conda. This change was very puzzling to me since dependency info isn't that verbose. I ended up determining the cause of this issue because I reverted this change and was then able to see the dependency versions in the log. I could see suppressing this being necessary for the R packages in case they aren't cached and a wall of compiler output gets printed out, but I see no real justification to mute it for python packages, especially given that they will only be installed for two short profiles.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nHot Fix \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1779](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1779)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

And it seems currently only cassandra use destroy and it just calls `close()` https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/cassandra/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/cassandra/CassandraInterpreter.java#L231. So IMO, we could delete destroy method, also we can delete the destroy method in `InterpreterGroup`.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nCurrent Interpreter Binding UI\r\n\r\n- *is too long so that users should scroll down to just close binding UI*\r\n- *doesn't have filter*\r\n- *hard to find the default interpreter*\r\n- *has restart button which can be designed better*\r\n\r\nAs the result of this PR the, binding UI would be better due to\r\n\r\n- **small size, not distracted UI**\r\n- **well noticed the default binding (green color)**\r\n- **simplicity by hiding restart button. even we can utilise the dropbox buttons to add more features for bindings** (e.g adding link to go to a specific interpreter)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement | Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Improve binding UI\r\n* [x] - Add binding filter\r\n* [x] - Highlight default binding\r\n* [x] - Remove useless text and stress important message in binding usage\r\n* [x] - DON'T Highlight when filtering bindings\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1766](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1766)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nOpen interpreter binding UI and manipulate it. \r\n\r\n- insert filter

issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1754]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1) build Zeppelin leaving console.log enabled\r\n2) start ZeppelinServer, open any notebook in browser\r\n3) open console with timestamps and check that PING request repeats exactly once in every 10 second\r\n4) restart ZeppelinServer but do not close or refresh the notebook page\r\n5) wait for websocket connection reopened\r\n6) check PING request frequency in console\r\nPING requests should repeat not often than once per 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n* Does this needs

What is this PR for?\r\nZEPPELIN-1003 made an abstraction layer for visualization and now visualizations are moved to [zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/builtins] https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/builtins from single monolithic place `paragraph.controller.js`.\r\n\r\nHowever, 'setting' of each visualizations (i.e. pivot keys, groups, values selection, column selection in scatter chart, etc) are still in paragraph.controller.js and its html template is hardcoded.\r\n\r\nThis PR lets each visualization implement their own 'setting' and provide facilities to store/load configs for it.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/d80a810184457b51b0d9229c663badca01199c26/zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/builtins/visualization-linechart.js#L86  can be an simple example how each visualization can have its own setting and save configs.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Make each visualization provides setting template\r\n* [x] - load / save configs for the setting\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1721\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is

Todos\r\n - [x] do not use distrs.apache.org\r\n - [x] levirage `download-maven-plugin` cache for Spark download\r\n - [x] set timeout 1min and 5 re-tries on download\r\n - [x] un-pack them under `/target/` so `mvn clean` works as expected\r\n - [x] mute logs for `./testing/install_external_dependencies.sh`\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nIn CI logs, Spark should be downloaded by `spark-dependencies` and cached under `${HOME}/.m2/repository/.cache/maven-download-plugin`\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?
