This affects queries like `SELECT COUNT(1) FROM t`, since we have to leave at least one column in Parquet requested schema. This PR works around this issue by selecting the \"narrowest\" column when no columns is requested. This issue has already been fixed in parquet-mr 1.8.2-SNAPSHOT ([PARQUET-363](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-363)).\n\n**UPDATE** We worked around the above issue by constructing a non-empty `MessageType` and then remove all its fields.

commit](https://github.com/liancheng/spark/commit/e48c83a9802acea9853ed27a22e5e6ed7a32f427).\n","created_at":"2015-10-22T14:50:42Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T02:52:34Z","closed_at":"2015-11-05T02:52:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9dd7ef69132e0b3d7dc61363267fdafcb99cf15f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e48c83a9802acea9853ed27a22e5e6ed7a32f427","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-9876.parquet-mr-1.8.1","ref":"spark-9876.parquet-mr-1.8.1","sha":"e48c83a9802acea9853ed27a22e5e6ed7a32f427","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

mode\" means the RPC env will not listen for incoming connections.\nThis allows certain processes in the Spark stack (such as Executors or\ntha YARN client-mode AM) to act as pure clients when using the netty-based\nRPC backend, reducing the number of sockets needed by the app and also the\nnumber of open ports.\n\nClient connections are also preferred when endpoints that actually have\na listening socket are involved; so, for example, if a Worker connects\nto a Master and the Master needs to send a message to a Worker endpoint,\nthat client connection will be used, even though the Worker is also\nlistening for incoming connections.\n\nWith this change, the workaround for SPARK-10987 isn't necessary anymore, and\nis removed. The AM connects to the driver in \"client mode\", and that connection\nis used for all driver <-> AM communication, and so the AM is properly notified\nwhen the connection goes down.\n","created_at":"2015-10-22T00:44:20Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T17:14:19Z","closed_at":"2015-11-02T18:28:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f2ab104eedb4834db8159e765fa610599c8ef19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/acce31fa84cd8edccb60c123b0a24da75ebd12a1","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-10997","ref":"SPARK-10997","sha":"acce31fa84cd8edccb60c123b0a24da75ebd12a1","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

current interface used to fetch shuffle data is not very efficient for\nlarge buffers; it requires the receiver to buffer the entirety of the\ncontents being downloaded in memory before processing the data.\n\nTo use the network library to transfer large files (such as those that\ncan be added using SparkContext addJar / addFile), this change adds a\nmore efficient way of downloding data, by streaming the data and feeding\nit to a callback as data arrives.\n\nThis is achieved by a custom frame decoder that replaces the current netty\none; this decoder allows entering a mode where framing is skipped and data\nis instead provided directly to a callback. The existing netty classes\n(ByteToMessageDecoder and LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder) could not be reused\nsince their semantics do not allow for the interception approach the new\ndecoder uses.\n","created_at":"2015-10-21T23:49:58Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T04:11:48Z","closed_at":"2015-11-04T17:13:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f1953c3a630569e9c762b721874e2824e6bd487","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d0ff6768bd9d94e19bd842d13d5dc18b3eae6c6","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-11235","ref":"SPARK-11235","sha":"4d0ff6768bd9d94e19bd842d13d5dc18b3eae6c6","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

When scanning the decimals in TPC-DS store_sales table, it's 80% faster (copy it as long without create Decimal objects).\n","created_at":"2015-10-21T19:13:11Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T04:46:15Z","closed_at":"2015-10-22T02:21:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"423c8f28cb4b6a349c9a045d3f198c6ac8ad6c90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cab9286b15bd784a023cd2b2c5c3ad755ebb566b","head":{"label":"davies:unsafe_cache","ref":"unsafe_cache","sha":"cab9286b15bd784a023cd2b2c5c3ad755ebb566b","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

patch attempts to address both https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10857 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10977. This patch is my original work which I license to the ASF. My ICLA is already on file as a Derby committer: http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html\n\nI have abandoned the approach discussed on those issues, viz., attempting to replace the user-supplied table name with a properly escaped and quoted chain of dot-separated delimited identifiers. I believe that JDBC does not supply enough information to attempt that substitution, particularly in the case of a Microsoft SQL Server running on a case-insensitive file system. An overview of the issues involved can be found here:  https://github.com/ontop/ontop/wiki/Case-sensitivity-for-SQL-identifiers\n\nInstead, this patch simply verifies that the table name is a valid SQL identifier before inserting it into a CREATE/DROP/INSERT statement or into a statement which tests whether the table exists. That is, a SQL injection attempt will fail because the injected text does not parse as a valid SQL identifier.\n\nThe validating code may not catch some bad names. This can happen for databases which don't allow embedded, escaped quotes inside quoted identifiers. Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle don't allow embedded quotes. For those databases, the bad table name will appear as an ungrammatical sequence of quoted identifiers. E.g.:\n\n  \"foo\"\"bar\"\n\nwill appear as\n\n  \"foo\" \"bar\"\n\nInstead of a \"bad identifier\" error, those databases will raise some other exception. I leave further polishing of this behavior to people who are experts on the affected databases.\n\nThis patch makes the following changes:\n\n1) Introduces a new Java class, SqlIdentifierUtil. The code was cribbed from Derby, where it has undergone almost 2 decades of commodity testing in production applications. I thought that it was safer to re-use this code rather than translate it into Scala and run the risk of introducing translation errors. However, I can try my hand at translating this class into Scala if reviewers think that that is a better approach.\n\nThe SqlIdentifierUtil class has 2 entry points:\n\na) quoteString() - This method escapes embedded quotes when converting a string to a quoted identifier. JdbcDialect.quoteIdentifier() did not account for this subtlety. But the patch makes JdbcDialect.quoteIdentifier() call SqlIdentifier.quoteString() now.\n\nb) parseMultiPartSQLIdentifier() - This method takes a dot separated sequence of SQL identifiers like databaseName.schemaName.tableName and returns an array of normalized identifiers like [ DATABASENAME, SCHEMANAME, TABLENAME ].\n\n2) Introduces some new JdbcDialect methods:\n\na) vetSqlIdentifier() - This method takes a table name and raises an exception if the name isn't a legal SQL identifier as determined by SqlIdentifierUtil.parseMultiPartSQLIdentifier().\n\nb) quoteChar() - This method returns the dialect-specific character which is used to frame quoted identifiers. This information is needed by SqlIdentifierUtil.parseMultiPartSQLIdentifier().\n\n3) Calls JdbcDialect.vetSqlIdentifier() everywhere that we plug a table name into a SQL statement. I have placed the calls to JdbcDialect.vetSqlIdentifier() as close to the statement text as possible in order to minimize the chance that a new code path will be introduced in the future which circumvents the SQL injection

current NettyRpc has a message order issue because it uses a thread pool to send messages. E.g., running the following two lines in the same thread,\n\n```\nref.send(\"A\")\nref.send(\"B\")\n```\n\nThe remote endpoint may see \"B\" before \"A\" because sending \"A\" and \"B\" are in parallel.\nTo resolve this issue, this PR added an outbox for each connection, and if we are connecting to the remote node when sending messages, just cache the sending messages in the outbox and send them one by one when the connection is established.\n","created_at":"2015-10-21T11:19:24Z","updated_at":"2015-10-23T15:12:54Z","closed_at":"2015-10-23T04:02:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f524644552c9e9bf8ff17fea7f1d74b8d2b59aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9197/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9197/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9197/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5def400a54ac99e004dbf82764a36c9af092248","head":{"label":"zsxwing:rpc-outbox","ref":"rpc-outbox","sha":"a5def400a54ac99e004dbf82764a36c9af092248","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5cdea7d1e54e751f928876ead33fc01e7e2f3437","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

PR adds a new experimental API to Spark, tentitively named Datasets._\n\nA `Dataset` is a strongly-typed collection of objects that can be transformed in parallel using functional or relational operations.  Example usage is as follows:\n### Functional\n\n``` scala\n> val ds: Dataset[Int] = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDS()\n> ds.filter(_ % 1 == 0).collect()\nres1: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)\n```\n### Relational\n\n``` scala\nscala> ds.toDF().show()\n+-----+\n|value|\n+-----+\n|    1|\n|    2|\n|    3|\n+-----+\n\n> ds.select(expr(\"value + 1\").as[Int]).collect()\nres11: Array[Int] = Array(2, 3, 4)\n```\n## Comparison to RDDs\n\n A `Dataset` differs from an `RDD` in the following ways:\n- The creation of a `Dataset` requires the presence of an explicit `Encoder` that can be\n  used to serialize the object into a binary format.  Encoders are also capable of mapping the\n  schema of a given object to the Spark SQL type system.  In contrast, RDDs rely on runtime\n  reflection based serialization.\n- Internally, a `Dataset` is represented by a Catalyst logical plan and the data is stored\n  in the encoded form.  This representation allows for additional logical operations and\n  enables many operations (sorting, shuffling, etc.) to be performed without deserializing to\n  an object.\n\nA `Dataset` can be converted to an `RDD` by calling the `.rdd` method.\n## Comparison to DataFrames\n\nA `Dataset` can be thought of as a specialized DataFrame, where the elements map to a specific\nJVM object type, instead of to a generic `Row` container. A DataFrame can be transformed into\nspecific Dataset by calling `df.as[ElementType]`.  Similarly you can transform a strongly-typed\n`Dataset` to a generic DataFrame by calling `ds.toDF()`.\n## Implementation Status and TODOs\n\nThis is a rough cut at the least controversial parts of the API.  The primary purpose here is to get something committed so that we can better parallelize further work and get early feedback on the API.  The following is being deferred to future PRs:\n- Joins and Aggregations (prototype here https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/f11f91e6f08c8cf389b8388b626cd29eec32d937)\n- Support for Java\n\nAdditionally, the responsibility for binding an encoder to a given schema is currently done in a fairly ad-hoc fashion.  This is an internal detail, and what we are doing today works for the cases we care about.  However, as we add more APIs we'll probably need to do this in a more principled way (i.e. separate resolution from binding as we do in DataFrames).\n## COMPATIBILITY NOTE\n\nLong term we plan to make `DataFrame` extend `Dataset[Row]`.  However,\nmaking this change to che class hierarchy would break the function signatures for the existing\nfunction operations (map, flatMap, etc).  As such, this class should be considered a preview\nof the final API.  Changes will be made to the interface after Spark 1.6.\n","created_at":"2015-10-21T01:14:48Z","updated_at":"2015-10-29T17:26:36Z","closed_at":"2015-10-22T22:21:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6ae967ae6c0cf3199e16a67095a063113e0394d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9190/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9190/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9190/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e251f87a830df9f40d523f00bbe14c174c91b2ae","head":{"label":"marmbrus:dataset-infra","ref":"dataset-infra","sha":"e251f87a830df9f40d523f00bbe14c174c91b2ae","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

is purely the yarn/src/main and yarn/src/test bits of the YARN ATS integration: the extension model to load and run implementations of `SchedulerExtensionService` in the yarn cluster scheduler process —and to stop them afterwards.\n\nThere's duplication between the two schedulers, yarn-client and yarn-cluster, at least in terms of setting everything up, because the common superclass, `YarnSchedulerBackend` is in spark-core, and the extension services need the YARN app/attempt IDs.\n\nIf you look at how the the extension services are loaded, the case class `SchedulerExtensionServiceBinding` is used to pass in config info -currently just the spark context and the yarn IDs, of which one, the attemptID, will be null when running client-side. I'm passing in a case class to ensure that it would be possible in future to add extra arguments to the binding class, yet, as the method signature will not have changed, still be able to load existing services.\n\nThere's no functional extension service here, just one for testing. The real tests come in the bigger pull requests. At the same time, there's no restriction of this extension service purely to the ATS history publisher. Anything else that wants to listen to the spark context and publish events could use this, and I'd also consider writing one for the YARN-913 registry service, so that the URLs of the web UI would be locatable through that (low priority; would make more sense if integrated with a REST client).\n\nThere's no minicluster test. Given the test execution overhead of setting up minicluster tests, it'd  probably be better to add an extension service into one of the existing tests.\n","created_at":"2015-10-20T15:01:23Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T23:15:27Z","closed_at":"2015-12-03T18:34:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7d8d0f353be46da567f1e45eceb4df05ace1092","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b9a183467e529dbde79bbf1548c0c921eba18d0e","head":{"label":"steveloughran:stevel/feature/SPARK-1537-service","ref":"stevel/feature/SPARK-1537-service","sha":"b9a183467e529dbde79bbf1548c0c921eba18d0e","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

ReceiverTracker and ReceiverSchedulingPolicy to use it\n\nThis PR includes the following changes:\n1. Add a new preferred location format, `executor_<host>_<executorID>` (e.g., \"executor_localhost_2\"), to support specifying the executor locations for RDD.\n2. Use the new preferred location format in `ReceiverTracker` to optimize the starting time of Receivers when there are multiple executors in a host. \n\nThe goal of this PR is to enable the streaming scheduler to place receivers (which run as tasks) in specific executors. Basically, I want to have more control on the placement of the receivers such that they are evenly distributed among the executors. We tried to do this without changing the core scheduling logic. But it does not allow specifying particular executor as preferred location, only at the host level. So if there are two executors in the same host, and I want two receivers to run on them (one on each executor), I cannot specify that. Current code only specifies the host as preference, which may end up launching both receivers on the same executor. We try to work around it but restarting a receiver when it does not launch in the desired executor and hope that next time it will be started in the right one. But that cause lots of restarts, and delays in correctly launching the receiver.\n\nSo this change, would allow the streaming scheduler to specify the exact executor as the preferred location. Also this is not exposed to the user, only the streaming scheduler uses this.\n","created_at":"2015-10-20T14:00:36Z","updated_at":"2015-10-28T00:30:33Z","closed_at":"2015-10-27T23:15:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6975897617077999eee135852e610df96b372608","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/46c5197c946cbed75ac28e1b60e64266ca070ee1","head":{"label":"zsxwing:executor-location","ref":"executor-location","sha":"46c5197c946cbed75ac28e1b60e64266ca070ee1","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c03b6d11589102b91f08728519e8520025db91e1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

af3bc59d1f5d9d952c2d7ad1af599c49f1dbdaf0 introduced new\nfunctionality so that if an executor dies for a reason that's not\ncaused by one of the tasks running on the executor (e.g., due to\npre-emption), Spark doesn't count the failure towards the maximum\nnumber of failures for the task.  That commit introduced some vague\nnaming that this commit attempts to fix; in particular:\n\n(1) The variable \"isNormalExit\", which was used to refer to cases where\nthe executor died for a reason unrelated to the tasks running on the\nmachine, has been renamed (and reversed) to \"exitCausedByApp\". The problem\nwith the existing name is that it's not clear (at least to me!) what it\nmeans for an exit to be \"normal\"; the new name is intended to make the\npurpose of this variable more clear.\n\n(2) The variable \"shouldEventuallyFailJob\" has been renamed to\n\"countTowardsTaskFailures\". This variable is used to determine whether\na task's failure should be counted towards the maximum number of failures\nallowed for a task before the associated Stage is aborted. The problem\nwith the existing name is that it can be confused with implying that\nthe task's failure should immediately cause the stage to fail because it\nis somehow fatal (this is the case for a fetch failure, for example: if\na task fails because of a fetch failure, there's no point in retrying,\nand the whole stage should be failed).\n","created_at":"2015-10-19T05:42:44Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T00:39:46Z","closed_at":"2015-10-27T23:56:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01828bd4e5a0453f66c087c7e7bb7f2bc997ec97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9164/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9164/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9164/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c09b255a2fd75777e3023ff7667a3737539cdff","head":{"label":"kayousterhout:SPARK-11178","ref":"SPARK-11178","sha":"4c09b255a2fd75777e3023ff7667a3737539cdff","user":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17229881,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIyOTg4MQ==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"kayousterhout/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout/spark-1","description":"Mirror

commit refactors the `run-tests-jenkins` script into Python. This refactoring was done by @brennonyork in #7401; this PR contains a few minor edits from @joshrosen in order to bring it up to date with other recent changes.\n\nFrom the original PR description (by @brennonyork):\n\nCurrently a few things are left out that, could and I think should, be smaller JIRA's after this.\n1. There are still a few areas where we use environment variables where we don't need to (like `CURRENT_BLOCK`). I might get around to fixing this one in lieu of everything else, but wanted to point that out.\n2. The PR tests are still written in bash. I opted to not change those and just rewrite the runner into Python. This is a great follow-on JIRA IMO.\n3. All of the linting scripts are still in bash as well and would likely do to just add those in as follow-on JIRA's as well.\n\nCloses

patch allows java developers to construct BlockMatrix and RowMatrix more naturally.\n\nTake BlockMatrix as an example, the type of 'blocks' in current constructor is RDD[((Int, Int), Matrix)], while more precisely it should be RDD[((Int, Int), T<:Matrix)]. This could cause some problem. If we add a Java-friendly constructor\n\n``` scala\ndef this(blocks: JavaRDD[((Integer, Integer), Matrix)],\n    rowsPerBlock: Int,\n    colsPerBlock: Int)\n```\n\nand then construct a BlockMatrix with RDD[(Int, Int), DenseMatrix], the complier will complain a conflict, like:\n\n```\nmethod constructor BlockMatrix with alternatives:\n(blocks: org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDD[((Integer, Integer), org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Matrix)],rowsPerBlock: Int,colsPerBlock: Int)org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix <and>\n(blocks: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[((Int, Int), org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Matrix)],rowsPerBlock: Int,colsPerBlock: Int)org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix\ncannot be applied to (org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[((Int, Int), org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.DenseMatrix)], Int, Int)\n```\n\nOn the other hand, BlockMatrix should hide the underlying implementation of sub-matrix, no matter it is dense or sparse. Thus, a class level covariant for Matrix is improper. That's why I add a companion object method to construct BlockMatrix/RowMatrix\n\nFor IndexedRowMatrix/CoordinateMatrix, since the RDD parameters for them are really simple and contain no type inheritance, I don't see necessity to add additional Java friendly apis for those two. Or do we need them to let java users construct IndexedRowMatrix/CoordinateMatrix in the same way as what they do with BlockMatrix/RowMatrix?\n","created_at":"2015-10-18T12:36:48Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T22:46:16Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T22:46:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c145312a448df92d5ea98548f33140d2bd2e86e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9159/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9159/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9159/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7260df6b72b3baa68ec856c9a186e3f9c8e3265c","head":{"label":"yzhliu:i10757-java-friendly-dist-matrices","ref":"i10757-java-friendly-dist-matrices","sha":"7260df6b72b3baa68ec856c9a186e3f9c8e3265c","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43690374,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzY5MDM3NA==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"yzhliu/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu/spark-1","description":"Mirror

For tasks that are currently running (which may still be\nin the pending lists, depending on how they were scheduled), we call\naddPendingTask in handleFailedTask, so the calls at the beginning\nof executorLost are redundant.\n\nI think these calls are left over from when we re-computed the locality\nlevels in addPendingTask; now that we call recomputeLocality separately,\nI don't think these are necessary.\n\nNow that those calls are removed, the readding parameter in addPendingTask\nis no longer necessary, so this commit also removes that parameter.\n\n@markhamstra can you take a look at this?\n\ncc @vanzin

to PARQUET-251, `BINARY` columns in existing Parquet files may be written with corrupted statistics information. This information is used by filter push-down optimization. Since Spark 1.5 turns on Parquet filter push-down by default, we may end up with wrong query results. PARQUET-251 has been fixed in parquet-mr 1.8.1, but Spark 1.5 is still using 1.7.0.\n\nThis affects all Spark SQL data types that can be mapped to Parquet {{BINARY}}, namely:\n- `StringType`\n- `BinaryType`\n- `DecimalType`\n  \n  (But Spark SQL doesn't support pushing down filters involving `DecimalType` columns for now.)\n\nTo avoid wrong query results, we should disable filter push-down for columns of `StringType` and `BinaryType` until we upgrade to parquet-mr 1.8.\n","created_at":"2015-10-16T20:12:42Z","updated_at":"2015-10-21T01:04:32Z","closed_at":"2015-10-21T01:04:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6dff8d6353c78988081a25bb746997ddf1732983","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9152/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9152/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9152/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3584d032e1ca4b10015a21c2b6b3f153014e3dfb","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-11153.workaround-parquet-251","ref":"spark-11153.workaround-parquet-251","sha":"3584d032e1ca4b10015a21c2b6b3f153014e3dfb","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

Clustering Coefficient (CC) is a fundamental measure in social (or other type of) network analysis assessing the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together [1][2]. Clustering coefficient, along with density, node degree, path length, diameter, connectedness, and node centrality are seven most important properties to characterise a network [3].\n\nWe found that GraphX has already implemented connectedness, node centrality, path length, but does not have a componenet for computing clustering coefficient. This actually was the first intention for us to implement an algorithm to compute clustering coefficient for each vertex of a given graph.\n\nClustering coefficient is very helpful to many real applications, such as user behaviour prediction and structure prediction (like link prediction). We did that before in a bunch of papers (e.g., [4-5]), and also found many other publication papers using this metric in their work [6-8]. We are very confident that this feature will benefit GraphX and attract a large number of users.\n\nReferences\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient\n[2] Watts, Duncan J., and Steven H.

PR improve the performance by:\n\n1) Generate an Iterator that take Iterator[CachedBatch] as input, and call accessors (unroll the loop for columns), avoid the expensive Iterator.flatMap.\n\n2) Use Unsafe.getInt/getLong/getFloat/getDouble instead of ByteBuffer.getInt/getLong/getFloat/getDouble, the later one actually read byte by byte.\n\n3) Remove the unnecessary copy() in Coalesce(), which is not related to memory cache, found during benchmark.\n\nThe following benchmark showed that we can speedup the columnar cache of int by 2x.\n\n```\npath = '/opt/tpcds/store_sales/'\nint_cols =

Spark SQL, the Exchange planner tries to avoid unnecessary sorts in cases where the data has already been sorted by a superset of the requested sorting columns. For instance, let's say that a query calls for an operator's input to be sorted by `a.asc` and the input happens to already be sorted by `[a.asc, b.asc]`. In this case, we do not need to re-sort the input. The converse, however, is not true: if the query calls for `[a.asc, b.asc]`, then `a.asc` alone will not satisfy the ordering requirements, requiring an additional sort to be planned by Exchange.\n\nHowever, the current Exchange code gets this wrong and incorrectly skips sorting when the existing output ordering is a subset of the required ordering. This is simple to fix, however.\n\nThis bug was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/7458, so it affects 1.5.0+.\n\nThis patch fixes the bug and significantly improves the unit test coverage of Exchange's sort-planning logic.

the registration RPC was not really an RPC, but a bunch of\ndisconnected messages, it was possible for other messages to be\nsent before the reply to the registration arrived, and that would\nconfuse the Worker. Especially in local-cluster mode, the worker was\nsucceptible to receiving an executor request before it received a\nmessage from the master saying registration succeeded.\n\nOn top of the above, the change also fixes a ClassCastException when\nthe registration fails, which also affects the executor registration\nprotocol. Because the `ask` is issued with a specific return type,\nif the error message (of a different type) was returned instead, the\ncode would just die with an exception. This is fixed by having a common\nbase trait for these reply messages.\n","created_at":"2015-10-15T18:35:19Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T02:35:36Z","closed_at":"2015-10-19T23:16:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"419977e309e85644c998e065cfd9259dfb7e0360","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d350249bbf40baa7677b150e4481c675784e9f2","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-11131","ref":"SPARK-11131","sha":"2d350249bbf40baa7677b150e4481c675784e9f2","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

purpose of this PR is to keep the unsafe format detail only inside the unsafe class itself, so when we use them(like use unsafe array in unsafe map, use unsafe array and map in columnar cache), we don't need to understand the format before use them.\n\nchange list:\n- unsafe array's 4-bytes numElements header is now required(was optional), and become a part of unsafe array format.\n- w.r.t the previous changing, the `sizeInBytes` of unsafe array now counts the 4-bytes header.\n- unsafe map's format was `[numElements] [key array numBytes] [key array content(without numElements header)] [value array content(without numElements header)]` before, which is a little hacky as it makes unsafe array's header optional. I think saving 4 bytes is not a big deal, so the format is now: `[key array numBytes] [unsafe key array] [unsafe value array]`.\n- w.r.t the previous changing, the `sizeInBytes` of unsafe map now counts both map's header and array's header.\n","created_at":"2015-10-15T06:25:04Z","updated_at":"2015-10-19T23:46:28Z","closed_at":"2015-10-19T18:03:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"312008c7edd80e8c8e01263a31d8f62995092dc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6bfeabb679ce642fb9fa6629a59700f3cd2ba99b","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:unsafe","ref":"unsafe","sha":"6bfeabb679ce642fb9fa6629a59700f3cd2ba99b","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

patch refactors the MemoryManager class structure. After #9000, Spark had the following classes:\n- MemoryManager\n- StaticMemoryManager\n- ExecutorMemoryManager\n- TaskMemoryManager\n- ShuffleMemoryManager\n\nThis is fairly confusing. To simplify things, this patch consolidates several of these classes:\n- ShuffleMemoryManager and ExecutorMemoryManager were merged into MemoryManager.\n- TaskMemoryManager is moved into Spark Core.\n\n**Key changes and tasks**:\n- [x] Merge ExecutorMemoryManager into MemoryManager.\n  - [x] Move pooling logic into Allocator.\n- [x] Move TaskMemoryManager from `spark-unsafe` to `spark-core`.\n- [x] Refactor the existing Tungsten TaskMemoryManager interactions so Tungsten code use only this and not both this and ShuffleMemoryManager.\n- [x] Refactor non-Tungsten code to use the TaskMemoryManager instead of ShuffleMemoryManager.\n- [x] Merge ShuffleMemoryManager into MemoryManager.\n  - [x] Move code\n  - [x] ~~Simplify 1/n calculation.~~ **Will defer to followup, since this needs more work.**\n- [x] Port ShuffleMemoryManagerSuite tests.\n- [x] Move classes from `unsafe` package to `memory` package.\n- [ ] Figure out how to handle the hacky use of the memory managers in HashedRelation's broadcast variable construction.\n- [x] Test porting and cleanup: several tests relied on mock functionality (such as `TestShuffleMemoryManager.markAsOutOfMemory`) which has been changed or broken during the memory manager consolidation\n  - [x] AbstractBytesToBytesMapSuite\n  - [x] UnsafeExternalSorterSuite\n  - [x] UnsafeFixedWidthAggregationMapSuite\n  - [x] UnsafeKVExternalSorterSuite\n\n**Compatiblity notes**:\n- This patch introduces breaking changes in `ExternalAppendOnlyMap`, which is marked as `@DevloperAPI` (likely for legacy reasons): this class now cannot be used outside of a task.\n","created_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:44Z","updated_at":"2015-10-26T04:44:40Z","closed_at":"2015-10-26T04:21:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5e7a1ebe2b00bdaceb1ce672090798f9d489269","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f68fdb10cdd988bca644c567f1f9b7f1d882dda6","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-10984","ref":"SPARK-10984","sha":"f68fdb10cdd988bca644c567f1f9b7f1d882dda6","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror
