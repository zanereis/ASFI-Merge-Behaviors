Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the partition and file pruning using `PARTITION_STATS` index in Spark.\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, when there were more than one base file in a table partition, the corresponding `PARTITION_STATS` index record in the metadata table contained `null` as the `file_path` field in `HoodieColumnRangeMetadata`.  The `null` causes `NPE` when loading the column stats per partition from `PARTITION_STATS` index (see the stacktrace at the end).  Also, the current implementation of `PartitionStatsIndexSupport` assumes that the `file_path` field contains the exact file name and it does not work if the the file path is filled as `null`.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, the following changes are made:\r\n- The relative partition path is filled into the `file_path` field of the `PARTITION_STATS` index record using `HoodieColumnRangeMetadata`. When fetching the `PARTITION_STATS` index records, through the `file_path` field we know which partition the stats are for.\r\n- The partition pruning based on `PARTITION_STATS` index now happens at the beginning of the file listing in `HoodieFileIndex` in Spark, instead of being one index support among `indicesSupport` which only happened conditionally before.\r\n- The partition pruning logic is adjusted based on the conditions (`HoodieFileIndex::prunePartitionsAndGetFileSlices`):\r\n  - For partitioned table and partition filters that are present, prune the partitions by the partition filters;\r\n  - For partitioned table and no partition filters, if data skipping is enabled, try using the `PARTITION_STATS` index to prune the partitions; if the pruning based on `PARTITION_STATS` index does not work, fall back to listing all partitions\r\n  - For non-partitioned table, or partitioned table without partition filter or data skipping or `PARTITION_STATS` index, list all partitions.\r\n- `PartitionStatsIndexSupport::prunePartitions` is added to prune partitions based on the data filters and `PARTITION_STATS` index, if the partition filter is absent.\r\n- The redundant methods around merging `HoodieColumnRangeMetadata` are removed.  `HoodieColumnRangeMetadata::merge` is adjusted and reused.\r\n\r\nTests are adjusted to cover the new logic.  Existing tests around `PARTITION_STATS` and `COLUMN_STATS` index also cover the new partition pruning logic to guarantee the results are correct.\r\n\r\n`NPE` when loading the column stats per partition from `PARTITION_STATS` index before this fix:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: element cannot be mapped to a null key\r\n    at

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhile writing the Hudi table in spark, I want to sync the table to Glue.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sync mode: `\"hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.mode\": \"glue\"` is actually not applicable in spark.\r\n\r\nIt instead works using this setting: `\"hoodie.meta.sync.client.tool.class\": \"org.apache.hudi.aws.sync.AwsGlueCatalogSyncTool\"`.\r\n\r\nI believe that the former config offers a better developer experience and is rather cheap to implement. Raising the PR for same as well.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSome spark code might spurious hoodie option of `\"hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.mode\": \"glue\"` but is actually writing to some other hive metastore. The behavior might start breaking.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nna\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n\"none\"\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n-

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the changes from #11479 and targets at `branch-0.x`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for compiling Hudi on Java 11 for engines like Spark and Flink that support Java 11 and 17.  Detailed changes:\r\n- Fixes compilation errors on Java 11; maintains the code to be compilable on Java 8.\r\n- Adds new GitHub CI jobs on validating Hudi built by Java 11, by running the tests on Spark 3.5 with Java 17 runtime.  These are moved from existing CI jobs validating Hudi built by Java 8.  The tests on Spark 3.3 and 3.4 still run with Java 8 compilation and Java 17 runtime. \r\n\r\nKudos to @Zouxxyy for contributing to this PR from #9300.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes Hudi compilable on Java 11.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocs on Java 11 compilation support.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

This also standardizes the usage of replacecommit to some extent (related to [HUDI-1739](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1739)).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

There `@TempDir` is used.\r\n\r\nI suppose the problem could be fixed by this change: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/2624. There `@TempDir` cleanup resets readable and executable permissions of the root temporary directory and any contained directories instead of failing to delete them.\r\n\r\nTo integrate this change we could bump JUnit version to 5.8.2. For proper tests discovering, `junit.platform.version` also should be bumped to 1.8.2.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOnly on tests run, which would be checked.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdded options to `HoodieSnapshotExporter.Config` to use and configure subclasses of `org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.Transformer` (SqlQueryBasedTransformer, SqlFileBasedTransformer, FlatteningTransformer and AWSDmsTransformer) with HoodieSnapshotExporter.\r\n\r\nFor now this is only implemented for non-hudi export. Is it really necessary to do the same functionality for hudi export?\r\nIssue https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/10644 is only about non-hudi. Also, doing hudi-export with transform/filter is complicated: current export to hudi is implemented via copying whole base files and .commit files (`FileUtil.copy()`), but not spark Datasets.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIncorporated a filtering/transforming mechanism into the Hudi exporter.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nIt needs to add new configuration options to HoodieSnapshotExporter documentation: `--transformer-class`, `--transformer-sql` and `--transformer-sql-file`.\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this MR for `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` we got\r\n```\r\nFailed to cast value `2004-02-29 01` to `LongType` for partition column `ts`\r\n```\r\nwhen we read data by Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n`listPartitionPaths()` is called with `parsePartitionColumnValues()`, and we got ClassCastException during parsing of partition paths. But we couldn't reconstruct partition column values from partition paths when `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` of `SCALAR`, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` or `EPOCHMILLISECONDS` types is used, due to lost information after corresponding processing of values.\r\n\r\nThis MR fixes ClassCastException, but there are still not finished separate tasks (old ones) mentioned in the added `TestSparkSqlWithTimestampKeyGenerator`:\r\n\r\n- Fix for [HUDI-3896] overwrites `shouldExtractPartitionValuesFromPartitionPath` in `BaseFileOnlyRelation`. I couldn't figure out during fixing this issue, should it be fixed, or it should be left as it is.\r\n\r\n- There is no logic for `shouldExtractPartitionValuesFromPartitionPath` in `HoodieBaseHadoopFsRelationFactory`. Couldn't find a corresponding task, so created a new one, HUDI-7925.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes ClassCastException. Save previous behavior for unaffected cases.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. Affects only if `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` of `SCALAR`, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` or `EPOCHMILLISECONDS` types is used. There is added `TestSparkSqlWithTimestampKeyGenerator`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo need.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-24T11:25:08Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T09:57:39Z","closed_at":"2024-06-26T09:17:18Z","merged_at":"2024-06-26T09:17:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae1ee05ab8c2bd732e57bee11c8748926b05ec4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6605747796,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABibu2VA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:M","name":"size:M","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nin the current scenario delete_partitions produces `replacecommit` with internal fields - like `_hoodie_file_name`, while e.g. normal `commit` produces schema without such fields.\r\nThis leads to unexpected behavior when the `replacecommit` is the last on the commitline - particularly in table schema fetching scenario, \r\ne.g. https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/10258\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/10533\r\nand e.g. metadata sync things, or any other potential write will take incorrect schema - and in the best case will fail because fields are duplicated(such as issues I mentioned), in the worst cases can lead to dataloss.\r\nThe problem introduced here https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5610/files\r\nAnd for other operations like `delete` the same approach used as I use now.\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nshould only fix issues.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium - looks like very small amount of users catched this issue within 2 years since it's introduced, but still.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-21T20:59:50Z","updated_at":"2024-06-29T09:33:47Z","closed_at":"2024-06-29T00:08:40Z","merged_at":"2024-06-29T00:08:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c0fb6d951e849d4b1487905bedb354c5df7b544","assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615585053,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHRHQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:S","name":"size:S","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for compiling Hudi on Java 11 for engines like Spark and Flink that support Java 11 and 17.  Detailed changes:\r\n- Fixes compilation errors on Java 11; maintains the code to be compilable on Java 8.\r\n- Adds new GitHub CI jobs on validating Hudi built by Java 11, by running the tests on Spark 3.5 with Java 17 runtime.  These are moved from existing CI jobs validating Hudi built by Java 8.  The tests on Spark 3.3 and 3.4 still run with Java 8 compilation and Java 17 runtime. \r\n\r\nKudos to @Zouxxyy for contributing to this PR from #9300.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes Hudi compilable on Java 11.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocs on Java 11 compilation support.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the skipping using storage partition stats index with sql. Previously, the issue was not caught in tests because it did not assert the skipping. Though there were no correctness issues, but queries were just as slow as without the index. Added more tests and validations to ensure the skipping indeed happens.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEfficient data skipping using storage partition stats index.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

the partitiion number is too bigger or too small\r\n- user need can not control it easy\r\n  - in some case user can set `spark.default.parallelism` change it.\r\n  - in some case user can not change

Change Logs\r\n\r\nContinuation of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11450 for `0.x` branch.\r\nThe issue still reproduces with the previous code and still fixes with this PR.\r\nThe biggest difference for me between 1.x and 0.x is that collected rows have different order of fields(even if I have the same level settings between writes). But if I compare by field names - works correctly.\r\nIf I use default spark Row equals - it shows different order + in problematic cases loses arrays replacing them with `null`(as in the initial issue).\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers should have no impact except now will not loose data/experience errors in certain setups.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium - since logic is complicated and I'm not aware of all potential use-cases, but at least existing tests pass + custom ones created which should cover 20 possible combinations(initialLevel, listNullability, targetLevel, listItemsNullability) - with levels covering 2 explicit setting and the default one.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-14T23:25:53Z","updated_at":"2024-06-19T18:28:46Z","closed_at":"2024-06-19T18:28:46Z","merged_at":"2024-06-19T18:28:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b9eaf31cf56f30528ae557f205d43a784ccde0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

I have `\"spark.hadoop.parquet.avro.write-old-list-structure\", \"false\"` explicitly set - to being able to write nulls inside arrays(the only way), Hudi starts to write Parquets with the following schema inside:\r\n```\r\n   required group internal_list (LIST) {\r\n    repeated group list {\r\n      required int64 element;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nBut if I had some files produced before setting `\"spark.hadoop.parquet.avro.write-old-list-structure\", \"false\"`, they have the following schema inside \r\n```\r\n  required group internal_list (LIST) {\r\n    repeated int64 array;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nAnd Hudi 0.14.x at least fails to read records from such file - failing with exception \r\n`Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Null-value for required field: `\r\n\r\nEven though arrays AND contents of arrays are `not null`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior \r\nTaken from Hudi 0.12.1(not sure what exactly broke that):\r\n1. If I have a file with 2 level structure and update(no matter having nulls inside the array or not - both produce the same) arrives with \"spark.hadoop.parquet.avro.write-old-list-structure\", \"false\" - overwrite it into 3 level.(**fails in 0.14.1**)\r\n2. If I have 3 level structure with nulls and update cames(not matter with nulls or without) - read and write correctly\r\n\r\nThe simple reproduction of issue can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/VitoMakarevich/hudi-issue-014\r\n\r\nHighly likely, the problem appeared after Hudi made some changes, so values from Hadoop conf started to propagate into Reader instance(likely they were not propagated before).\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\nAdded explicit override of `spark.hadoop.parquet.avro.write-old-list-structure` = `true` if file being read is old(has 2 level structure).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRunning tests to ensure no unexpected issues propagating.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium - since logic is complicated and I'm not aware of all potential use-cases, but at least existing tests pass + custom ones created which should cover 20 possible combinations(initialLevel, listNullability, targetLevel, listItemsNullability) - with levels covering 2 explicit setting and the default one.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe PR adds changes such that:\r\nIf cleaner last clean commit tracks savepointed instants and there is a replace commit following the savepoint and before earliest instant to retain for cleaner, then the archival will block on the replace commit instead of the earliest instant to retain. \r\nThis is required to handle the issue of duplicates. If replace commit is replacing file groups retained by the savepoint, the cleaner must be able to clean these file groups before the replace commit is archived.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdded infer logic to `SevenToEightUpgradeHandler` similar to `HoodieTableMetaClient.inferRecordMergeMode()`. Record merge mode is required to dictate the merging behavior in release 1.x after merging https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9894. It plays the same role as the payload class config in the release 0.x.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in [`HoodieTableVersion`](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/3415a4a1a2cdf415bd5fd9893196ef9e619e6728/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/common/table/HoodieTableVersion.java#L45):\r\n- version 7 is Hudi 0.16, which has not been released yet,\r\n- version 8 is Hudi 1.0 beta.\r\n\r\nSo I couldn't make end-to-end tests with upgrade from 7 to 8.\r\nAnd due to added completion time in the timeline after https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9617, I couldn't update and read some table by Hudi 1.0 beta (version 8), after it has been written by Hudi 0.14 (version 6).\r\n\r\nI could only [write some table by version 6](https://github.com/geserdugarov/test-hudi-issues/blob/main/HUDI-7847/create-table-version-6.py), and try to [call upgrade with checking `hoodie.properties`](https://github.com/geserdugarov/test-hudi-issues/blob/main/HUDI-7847/upgrade-from-6-to-8.py). I did this check locally by using linked scripts with corresponding Hudi versions.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo need\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI
