pipeline returns `errors` when trying to insert rows that do not match the BigQuery table schema. `errors` is a dictionary that cointains one `FailedRows` key. `FailedRows` is a list of tuples where each tuple has two elements: BigQuery table name and the row that didn't match the schema.\r\n\r\nThis can be verified by running the `BigQueryIO deadletter pattern` https://beam.apache.org/documentation/patterns/bigqueryio/\r\n\r\nUsing the template approach I can print the failed rows in a pipeline. When running the job, logger simultaneously prints out the reason why the rows were invalid. \r\n\r\nThe reason (for why the row is invalid) should also be included in the tuple in addition to the BigQuery table and the raw row. This way next pipeline could eg. insert the invalid rows into a different BigQuery table with a schema.\r\n```python\r\nerror_schema = (\r\n    {\r\n        'fields': [\r\n            {'name': 'timestamp', 'type': 'TIMESTAMP', 'mode': 'REQUIRED'},\r\n            {'name': 'table', 'type': 'STRING', 'mode': 'REQUIRED'},\r\n            {'name': 'reason', 'type': 'STRING', 'mode': 'NULLABLE'},\r\n            {'name': 'row_json', 'type': 'STRING', 'mode': 'REQUIRED'},\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe whole pipeline implementation could look something like this\r\n```python\r\nwith beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) as p:\r\n\r\n    errors = (\r\n        p\r\n        | \"Read from Pub/Sub subscription\" >> beam.io.gcp.pubsub.ReadFromPubSub(\r\n            subscription=known_args.input_subscription,\r\n            timestamp_attribute=None)\r\n        | \"UTF-8 bytes to string\" >> beam.Map(lambda msg: msg.decode(\"utf-8\"))\r\n        | \"Parse JSON messages\" >> beam.Map(json.loads)\r\n        | \"WriteToBigQuery\" >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(\r\n            known_args.output_table,\r\n            schema=schema,\r\n            create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_NEVER,\r\n            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND,\r\n            ignore_unknown_columns=False,\r\n            insert_retry_strategy=RetryStrategy.RETRY_ON_TRANSIENT_ERROR\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    result = (\r\n        errors[\"FailedRows\"]\r\n        | 'ParseErrors' >> beam.Map(lambda err: {\r\n                \"timestamp\": time.time_ns() / 1000000000,\r\n                \"table\": err[0],\r\n                \"reason\": None, # TODO to be replaced with `err[2]`\r\n                \"row_json\": json.dumps(err[1]),\r\n            })\r\n        | \"WriteErrorsToBigQuery\" >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(\r\n            known_args.output_table + \"_error_records\",\r\n            schema=error_schema,\r\n            create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED,\r\n            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND,\r\n            ignore_unknown_columns=False,\r\n            insert_retry_strategy=RetryStrategy.RETRY_ON_TRANSIENT_ERROR\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring my reasearch i found a couple of alternate solutions, but i think they are more complex than they need to be. Thats why I explored the beam source code and found the solution to be an easy and simple change.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the model in `load_model()` method by passing reference of the Model class to the `PyTorchModelLoader` class.\r\n\r\nBehavior before change\r\n\r\nThe `PytorchModelLoader` accepts a `model_class: torch.nn.Module`. If the user creates an object of `torch.nn.Module` and pass the object to the `PytorchModelLoader` before the pipeline, the model object gets pickled. If the model object is too large in size, the pipeline fails. \r\n\r\nBehavior after change\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we pass a`model_class: Callable` which is a reference to the model class definition and also, `model_params: Dict[str, Any]`, which are input parameters to the model, to the `PytorchModelLoader` and we load the model in the `load_model()` method. In this way, the model gets instantiated on the workers instead of SDK.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a schema is inferred through the existing depth-first-search-sort of algorithm, a HashSet has been added, so that we keep a record of existing schemas used in this DFS, which is used as a catcher to prevent an infinite loop if a schema ends up circling back and referencing itself. Without this addition, a stack overflow would happen if a schema ends up introducing a circular reference, as a result of infinite recursion. \r\n\r\nExample of schema this PR attempts to fix:\r\n``` \r\nmessage TSFoo\r\n\r\n{ string a = 1; string b = 2; TSFoo theOlderMe = 3; }\r\nnew ProtoMessageSchema().schemaFor(TypeDescriptor.of(Foo.TSFoo.class));\r\n```\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of Changes**\r\n\r\nThis pr is a continuation of building watermark support in the Go Sdk. It builds on the work done in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17374 and introduces the ability for watermark estimators to be updated based on the timestamp of emitted elements. It includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Execution (emit/emit.go, exec/pardo.go, sdf/sdf.go)\r\n- Code generation (generate/generate.go, **.shims.go, optimized/emitters.tmpl, optimized/emitters.go)\r\n- Concrete implementation of a timestamp observing estimator (sdf/watermark_estimator.go)\r\n\r\nThis is built according to the design specified here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DqCYJ-J1YGNelCRIcN5v6BQsZxJB2l5uWBmN4ti--Ew/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**Next Steps**\r\n\r\nThe following work remains to be implemented after this is completed\r\n\r\n- Manual estimators (PR in progress - https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17475)\r\n- Doc changes\r\n\r\n**Manual Testing**\r\n\r\nOn top of all the unit tests introduced, I hacked the existing textio sdf doFn and added the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) CreateWatermarkEstimator(t time.Time) *sdf.TimestampObservingWatermarkEstimator {\r\n\treturn &sdf.TimestampObservingWatermarkEstimator{State: t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) InitialWatermarkEstimatorState(_ beam.EventTime, _ offsetrange.Restriction, _ string, _ int64) time.Time {\r\n\treturn time.Now().AddDate(-1, 0, 0)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) WatermarkEstimatorState(e *sdf.TimestampObservingWatermarkEstimator) time.Time {\r\n\treturn e.State\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand emitted elements 10 years in the future from processElement. Then I ran wordCount (with the textio sdf version) on dataflow so that I could observe the output watermark was getting correctly updated to the current wall clock time + 1 month:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"437\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/165524201-8a16ad7f-4ca0-4d46-9b8d-37dcb9d8eb5c.png\">\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of Changes**\r\n\r\nThis pr is a continuation of building watermark support in the Go Sdk. It builds on the work done in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17374 and introduces the ability for watermark estimators to be invoked from ProcessElement. It includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Validation (fn/fn.go, fn/fn_test.go, graph/fn.go, graph/fn_test.go)\r\n- Execution (exec/fn.go and exec/pardo.go)\r\n- Code generation (exec/fn_arity.tmpl, exec/fn_arity.go, reflectx/calls.tmpl, reflectx/calls.go)\r\n- Concrete implementation of a manual estimator (sdf/watermark_estimator.go)\r\n\r\nThis is built according to the design specified here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DqCYJ-J1YGNelCRIcN5v6BQsZxJB2l5uWBmN4ti--Ew/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**Next Steps**\r\n\r\nThe following work remains to be implemented after this is completed\r\n\r\n- Timestamp observing estimators (call ObserveTimestamp on each emitted timestamp) - in progress, https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17476\r\n- Doc changes\r\n\r\n**Manual Testing**\r\n\r\nOn top of all the unit tests introduced, I hacked the existing textio sdf doFn and added the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) CreateWatermarkEstimator(t time.Time) *sdf.ManualWatermarkEstimator {\r\n\treturn &sdf.ManualWatermarkEstimator{State: t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) InitialWatermarkEstimatorState(_ beam.EventTime, _ offsetrange.Restriction, _ string, _ int64) time.Time {\r\n\treturn time.Now()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) WatermarkEstimatorState(e *sdf.ManualWatermarkEstimator) time.Time {\r\n\treturn e.State\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand added the following to ProcessElement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) ProcessElement(ctx context.Context, we *sdf.ManualWatermarkEstimator, rt *sdf.LockRTracker, filename string, _ int64, emit func(string)) error {\r\n\twe.UpdateWatermark(time.Now().AddDate(0, 1, 0)) // Add 1 month to current time\r\n```\r\n\r\nand ran wordCount (with the textio sdf version) on dataflow so that I could observe the output watermark was getting correctly updated to the current wall clock time + 1 month:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"418\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/165515083-bb9f5a55-3a42-4a5c-9eb1-762dda6f383a.png\">\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

currently only support ability to pass in a single Tensor that does not have any keys attached to it: `model(input)`. We want to support kwargs like this: `model(**inputs)`.\r\n\r\nBecause of the way Beam returns `BatchElements()`, we need to convert a list of (key to Tensor) dicts into a dict of Tensor lists.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds support for non-batchable params that are passed in as side inputs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to resolve :  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13250\r\nfirst commit is identical to https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15977, but since I believe this is relevant , I am open to put some effort to integrate a proper solution \r\n\r\nThis change is relevant for testing purpose. Being able to change `storage_client` allows use gcs emulator or other gcs configurations.  (for example: https://github.com/fsouza/fake-gcs-server/issues/623#issuecomment-1107093547 )\r\n\r\nThis way it is possible at the very least to do : \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass TestGCSFileSystem(GCSFileSystem):\r\n  GCS_PREFIX = 'gs-test://'\r\n\r\n  @classmethod\r\n  def scheme(cls):\r\n    return 'gs-test'\r\n\r\n  @staticmethod\r\n  def get_gcsio():\r\n    return gcsio.GcsIO(\r\n      storage_client=storage.StorageV1(\r\n          url=\"http://my_custom_url...\",\r\n          # Other custom configurations ...\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n\r\n```\r\nPlease note that this is not only usefull for testing purpose, it allows more flexibility  to configure the storage_client for the price of adding another user defined filesystem scheme \r\n\r\nAnother alternative could to instead add an beam options  to be able to replace the url or other options. This might be better since it does not a new function to the GcsFileSystem that could be used by sdk users\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\nR:  @aaltay  @ihji\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the TruncateRestriction support for SDFs in Go SDK. When a user wants to [drain](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/stopping-a-pipeline#drain) a pipeline, [TruncateRestriction](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/2aa24dc3758750bd76c024dc787c06b91fd725ed/model/pipeline/src/main/proto/org/apache/beam/model/pipeline/v1/beam_runner_api.proto#L436) component is invoked which modifies the restriction as implemented by the user in `DoFn.TruncateRestriction` method so that pipelines can finish quicker. This is an optional implementation method. The default implementation would be to keep the same restriction for bounded SDFs to process the inflight data and return an empty restriction for unbounded scenarios which means discarding them. This default implementation is handled on the SDK side.\r\nDesign Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C4hoE28Ye0fO6lbpZSb84BbJLNI2N4cYCH1FOhAyFEk/edit#\r\n\r\nOnly unit testing has been done so far.

is the first step towards allowing users to fully replace the code generator with a DoFn registration function (design doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MLZLUhb-Sn7AJ666yn3TnYgMKE6wiXIBs7cjB_20hMA/edit?usp=sharing). Generally, this accomplishes this by:\r\n\r\n- Updating to Go 1.18\r\n- Adding registration.tmpl to generate registration.go with a bunch of arity specific registration functions. At the moment, these register struct wrappers, types, and funcs for the passed in DoFn.\r\n- Update specialize/main.go to provide some functions used by registration.tmpl\r\n\r\nBecause the tmpl file is hard to review in isolation, I would do so with the generated file side by side so that you can see how the template translates into the final code. Reviewing the full generated file is impossible because of how many functions are generated.\r\n\r\n**Next steps**\r\n\r\nAfter this is in, I will follow up with prs to:\r\n\r\n1. Handle emitter/iter registration\r\n2. Handle combiner registration\r\n3. Perf testing\r\n4. Updates to the docs/our examples\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
