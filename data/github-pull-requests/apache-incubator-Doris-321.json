Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #10646\r\n\r\nBE part for https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/10646. The FE part is https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/10647.\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nDescribe the overview of changes.\r\n\r\nThere is a common query pattern to find latest time serials data.\r\n eg. SELECT * from t_log WHERE t>t1 AND t<t2 ORDER BY t DESC LIMIT 100\r\n\r\nIf the ORDER BY columns is the prefix of the sort key of table, it can\r\nbe greatly optimized to read much fewer data instead of read all data\r\nbetween t1 and t2.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging the same order of ORDER BY columns and sort key of table,\r\njust read the LIMIT N rows for each related segment and merge N rows.\r\n\r\n1. set read_orderby_key to true for read_params and _reader_context\r\n   if olap_scan_node's sort info is set.\r\n2. set read_orderby_key_reverse to true for read_params and _reader_context\r\n   if is_asc_order is false.\r\n3. rowset reader force merge read segments if read_orderby_key is true.\r\n4. block reader and tablet reader force merge read rowsets if read_orderby_key is true.\r\n\r\n5. for ORDER BY DESC, read and compare in reverse order\r\n5.1 segment iterator read backward using a new BackwardBitmapRangeIterator and\r\n    reverse the result block before return to caller.\r\n5.2 VCollectIterator::LevelIteratorComparator, VMergeIteratorContext return\r\n    opposite result for _is_reverse order in its compare function.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (No)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (No)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-08T07:22:32Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T01:08:45Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T01:08:44Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T01:08:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"f9b151744d0870f97efd824bdde3273f04fa0756","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1705187220,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg3MjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/planner","name":"area/planner","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

There are some problems need to be considered:\r\n\r\n- The cost for getting started is high\r\n- The requirements for the implementation quality of functions are relatively high, otherwise it will affect the stability of be, such as leading to core\r\n\r\nTo solove this problem , I think  the remote udaf function  is a good way  it can benifits:\r\n\r\n- the cost for getting started is low, for it can use  any language to impl  udaf interface\r\n- decouple with doris kernel， it good for be stability\r\n\r\nWe need to consider the performance, and whether the remote call will have a lot of overhead， Here I did a test\r\n## Test the time-consuming of summation operation with different amount of data\r\n\r\n#### Step1. deploy with 2 BE node,  Table scheam:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE `table1` (\r\n  `event_day` date NULL,\r\n  `siteid` int(11) NULL DEFAULT \"10\",\r\n  `citycode` smallint(6) NULL,\r\n  `username` varchar(32) NULL DEFAULT \"\",\r\n  `pv` bigint(20) SUM NULL DEFAULT \"0\"\r\n) ENGINE=OLAP\r\nAGGREGATE KEY(`event_day`, `siteid`, `citycode`, `username`)\r\nCOMMENT 'OLAP'\r\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`siteid`) BUCKETS 10\r\nPROPERTIES (\r\n\"replication_allocation\" = \"tag.location.default: 1\",\r\n\"in_memory\" = \"false\",\r\n\"storage_format\" = \"V2\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step2 create remote udaf \r\n```\r\nCREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION  rpc_myadd(int) RETURNS int PROPERTIES (\r\n    \"TYPE\"=\"RPC\",\r\n    \"OBJECT_FILE\"=\"127.0.0.1:9000\",\r\n    \"update_fn\"=\"rpc_sum_update\",\r\n    \"merge_fn\"=\"rpc_sum_merge\",\r\n    \"finalize_fn\"=\"rpc_sum_finalize\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n#### Step3 import data with diffrent rows\r\n#### Result\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11487604/177777586-37218055-82ea-4d2b-b9f9-8cb2ba3fe8da.png)\r\n\r\n**we can concluded:**\r\n- RPC udaf performance is better than that of non vectorized aggregate function by 6% - 29%\r\n- The performance of RPC udaf is significantly lower than that of native vectorized aggregate functions, but when the number of data rows is 1000W, it can still return in seconds, and theoretically it can support most business scenarios\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11487604/177778335-90bad5b6-01f7-4594-98b1-0902d8945733.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11487604/177778356-b7076410-e39d-4485-805c-e445b38edbc6.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11487604/177778387-a93eab1d-bae3-4358-a18f-6d5a6835811c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11487604/177778412-8499d990-7a22-4eb1-b7eb-e783a4b73893.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

This can lead to that the position of nullmap is one, but the data exists.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nPhysical sort:\r\n     * 1. Build sortInfo\r\n     *    There are two types of slotRef:\r\n     *    one is generated by the previous node, collectively called old.\r\n     *    the other is newly generated by the sort node, collectively called new.\r\n     *    Filling of sortInfo related data structures,\r\n     *    a. ordering use newSlotRef.\r\n     *    b. sortTupleSlotExprs use oldSlotRef.\r\n     * 2. Create sortNode\r\n     * 3. Create mergeFragment\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1.Currently, columns that do not exist in select but exist in order by cannot be parsed.\r\neg: select key from table order by value;\r\n\r\n2.For the combination of Literal and slotRefrance in select, there is a problem with parsing, \r\neg: select key ,(10-value) from table;\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nDescribe the overview of changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (No)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (No)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\n#### first: Add two expr rewrite rule:\r\n1. remove duplicate expr\r\na = 1 and a = 1 -> a = 1\r\n\r\n2.  extract common expr\r\n(a or b) and (a or c) -> a or (b and c)\r\n\r\n#### second: Add some plan rewrite rule of rewriting expr of operator\r\n1. `NormalizeExpressionOfPlan` contains normalize expr rewrite rule. Using these normalizerule rewrite `LogicalFilter`、`LogicalAggravate`，`LogicalProject`，`LogicalJoin` exprs\r\n2. `OptimizeExpressionOfPlan` contains optimize expr rewrite rule. Using these optimize rule rewrite `LogicalFilter`、`LogicalAggravate`，`LogicalProject`，`LogicalJoin` exprs\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (Yes/No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (Yes/No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at

refactor first/last value agg functions\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, the implementation of **first/last value** is used for window functions, and **lead/lag** is also mixed in the implementation;\r\nLater, when aiming at the **replace** model, also borrowed the basic implementation of first/last and made some changes.\r\nThen, when **load**, also made some changes, so it became more and more complex. \r\nAnd now, the two are separated and further optimized respectively\r\n\r\n# Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nDescribe the

should not reuse between TupleDescriptors\r\n- expression's nullable now works fine\r\n- remove quotes when parse string literal\r\n- set resolvedTupleExprs in SortNode to control output\r\n- remove the extra column in sortTupleSlotExprs in SortInfo\r\n\r\nknown issues\r\n- aggregate function must be the top expression in output expression (need project in ExecNode in BE)\r\n- first phase aggregate could not convert to stream mode.\r\n- OlapScanNode do not set data partition\r\n- Sort could not process expression like 'order by a + 1' and SortInfo generated in a trick way and should be refactor when we want to support 'order by a + 1'\r\n- column prune do not work as expected\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\nto support vectorized outer join, we introduced a out tuple for hash join node, but it breaks the checking for colocate join. To solve this problem, we need map the output slot id to the children's slot id of hash join node, and the colocate join can be checked correctly.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (Yes/No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (Yes/No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

in constructor or deconstructor`. \r\nThe deconstructor function of `ArrowReaderWrap` call the virtual function named `close()`.\r\nWhen deconstructing, it will nerver call `ParquetReaderWrap::close()` just call the `ArrowReaderWrap::close()`\r\n\r\n**The second issuse** is parallism deconstructing for `ParquetReaderWrap` and `prefetch_batch`.\r\n`prefetch_batch` use `thread.detach()` to seprate the control from `ParquetReaderWrap`, but it rely on some local vars from `ParquetReaderWrap` such as **`_closed ` /`_total_groups ` and `_reader`**\r\n\r\nIn this case, `ParquetReaderWrap` may call deconstructor before `prefetch_batch` and then get the core dump.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #10583\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn the previous test, consume mem tracker based on tcmalloc hook is expected to bring 2% performance loss to the query.\r\n\r\nBut in extreme cases, when load JSON data, the tcmalloc hook may bring about a 30% performance loss.\r\n\r\nThe performance loss is divided into five parts:\r\n1. Calculate the actual system memory size of this alloc/free;\r\n2. After accumulating to 2M, consume mem tracker;\r\n3. Get bthread tls;\r\n4. The function call introduced for consuming mem tracker in tls;\r\n5. The hook itself;\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107781942/177357859-be166788-149e-4e28-bc51-922bdb46f91a.png)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n1. Avoid trying to get bthread tls in every hook;\r\n2. Optimize unnecessary conditional judgments;\r\n3. Reduce the number of function call layers in the hook;\r\n4. Modified to consume mem tracker after accumulating 4M;\r\n\r\nIn the test environment, this can reduce the performance loss of tcmalloc hook from 6% to 2%.\r\nDivided into three parts:\r\n1. Calculate the actual system memory size of this alloc/free, 1/3 of the loss;\r\n2. Consume mem tracker after accumulating 4M, 1/6 of the loss;\r\n3. The hook itself, 1/2 of the loss;\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107781942/177382753-2dc96d23-d1c5-4f0b-9b79-9882462a4f66.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (Yes/No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (Yes/No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-05T17:24:59Z","updated_at":"2022-07-11T00:35:06Z","closed_at":"2022-07-11T00:35:06Z","merged_at":"2022-07-11T00:35:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"4cb80c5733a1a70a016cee8ab902f8d38f6acc7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/10629/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/10629/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/10629/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/eddb0481036b48cbe49f13b1d01f61763fd7b60c","head":{"label":"k-i-d-d:fix_memtracker_performance","ref":"fix_memtracker_performance","sha":"eddb0481036b48cbe49f13b1d01f61763fd7b60c","user":{"login":"k-i-d-d","id":107781942,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmyfNg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107781942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d","html_url":"https://github.com/k-i-d-d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":505788873,"node_id":"R_kgDOHiW5yQ","name":"doris","full_name":"k-i-d-d/doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"k-i-d-d","id":107781942,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmyfNg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107781942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d","html_url":"https://github.com/k-i-d-d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-i-d-d/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/k-i-d-d/doris","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #10595\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen build hash table in `HashJoinNode::_hash_table_build`, build side data is collected as a vector of Blocks of size 4G at maximum, if it happens that the total size of build side data is exactly e.g. 4G, then an empty Block will be added to the vector:\r\n```\r\n    while (!eos) {\r\n        block.clear_column_data();\r\n        RETURN_IF_CANCELLED(state);\r\n\r\n        RETURN_IF_ERROR(child(1)->get_next(state, &block, &eos));\r\n        _hash_table_mem_tracker->consume(block.allocated_bytes());\r\n        _mem_used += block.allocated_bytes();\r\n\r\n        if (block.rows() != 0) {\r\n            mutable_block.merge(block);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // make one block for each 4 gigabytes\r\n        constexpr static auto BUILD_BLOCK_MAX_SIZE = 4 * 1024UL * 1024UL * 1024UL;\r\n        if (UNLIKELY(_mem_used - last_mem_used > BUILD_BLOCK_MAX_SIZE)) {\r\n            _build_blocks.emplace_back(mutable_block.to_block());\r\n            // TODO:: Rethink may we should do the proess after we recevie all build blocks ?\r\n            // which is better.\r\n            RETURN_IF_ERROR(_process_build_block(state, _build_blocks[index], index));\r\n\r\n            mutable_block = MutableBlock();\r\n            ++index;\r\n            last_mem_used = _mem_used;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    _build_blocks.emplace_back(mutable_block.to_block());\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater when building RF in `RuntimeFilterSlotsBase::insert`, it will try to get a column from an empty Block, which causes the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a potential bug: when build side data exceed 4G * 128, the Blocks added previously into the vector may be relocated, which will invalidate the Block address used as map key in `td::unordered_map<const Block*, std::vector<int>> _inserted_rows;`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (Yes/No/I Don't know)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes/No/No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (Yes/No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (Yes/No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-05T07:28:19Z","updated_at":"2022-07-18T06:25:41Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T11:14:43Z","merged_at":"2022-07-05T11:14:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e879602028eaf08040fb7a3e58672ca65cbc489","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3169875398,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTY5ODc1Mzk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/vectorization","name":"area/vectorization","color":"0052CC","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4322353571,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBfSlxs8AAAABAaHhow","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/dev/merge-1.1.1","name":"dev/merge-1.1.1","color":"834298","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/10614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/10614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/10614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/77b2730dc8e3fa5914079a05eed5de3ea59a14c5","head":{"label":"jacktengg:fix-vhash-join-build-blocks","ref":"fix-vhash-join-build-blocks","sha":"77b2730dc8e3fa5914079a05eed5de3ea59a14c5","user":{"login":"jacktengg","id":18241664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQxNjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18241664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg","html_url":"https://github.com/jacktengg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460258238,"node_id":"R_kgDOG277vg","name":"incubator-doris","full_name":"jacktengg/incubator-doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jacktengg","id":18241664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQxNjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18241664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg","html_url":"https://github.com/jacktengg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacktengg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jacktengg/incubator-doris","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\n1. Support \"show proc 'catalogs/'\"\r\n2. Refactor some interface implementation of HMSExternalDataSource, HMSExternalDatabase, HMSExternalTable.\r\n    1. The meta instance id(dsId, dbId, tblId) is now generated from `Catalog.getNextId()`\r\n    2. Each meta instance(ds, db, tbl) will only be created once, so that the id of these instances will not be changed in each call.\r\n\r\n3. Remove duplicate interface implementation of `DataSourceIf`, `DatabaseIf`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (No)\r\n4. Has unit tests been added: (No Need)\r\n5. Has document been added or modified: (No Need)\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies: (No)\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #10594\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nSomething the upstream system(eg, hive) may create empty orc file\r\nwhich only has a header and footer, without schema.\r\nAnd if we call `_reader->createRowReader()` with selected columns,\r\nit will throw ParserError: Invalid column selected xx.\r\nSo here we first check its number of rows and skip these kind of files.\r\n\r\nThis is only a fix for non-vec load, for vec load, it use arrow scanner\r\nto read orc file, which does not have this problem.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (No)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (No Need)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,
