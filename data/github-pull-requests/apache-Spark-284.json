What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `spark.ui.filters` are not applied to the handlers added after binding the server. This means that every page which is added after starting the UI will not have the filters configured on it. This can allow unauthorized access to the pages.\r\n\r\nThe PR adds the filters also to the handlers added after the UI starts.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual tests (without the patch, starting the thriftserver with `--conf spark.ui.filters=org.apache.hadoop.security.authentication.server.AuthenticationFilter --conf spark.org.apache.hadoop.security.authentication.server.AuthenticationFilter.params=\"type=simple\"` you can access `http://localhost:4040/sqlserver`; with the patch, 401 is the response as for the other pages).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-10T10:51:44Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T23:53:22Z","closed_at":"2018-06-12T23:47:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"326cfa593f257834091ffd32e89aa2dee77dcb83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02a9f4e444b3c587733dde08560ed078ff4f3c50","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-24506","ref":"SPARK-24506","sha":"02a9f4e444b3c587733dde08560ed078ff4f3c50","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

Changes\r\n\r\n1. Add an optional Param to VectorAssembler for specifying the sizes of Vectors in the inputCols. \r\n- If not given, then VectorAssembler will behave as it does now. \r\n- If given, then VectorAssembler can use that info instead of figuring out the Vector sizes via metadata or examining Rows in the data. And it does consistency checks.\r\n2. Add a VectorAssemblerEstimator which gets the Vector lengths from data and produces a VectorAssembler_Model_ with the vector lengths Param specified.\r\n\r\nTodos:\r\n1. Replace `VectorSizeHint`.\r\n2. Reduce code duplication. Not sure if want to have a trait that reduces duplication between `VectorAssembler` and `VectorAssemblerEstimator`, like 'OneHotEncoderBase'.\r\n3. Comments & documentations etc.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2018-06-09T20:24:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T18:26:04Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T18:26:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"778cf9c3358e71113c518df20f60cc64c26aafe5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e3aa44c3937d60d5aa35dd03604e57ef218ebb4","head":{"label":"tengpeng:Spark-24467","ref":"Spark-24467","sha":"8e3aa44c3937d60d5aa35dd03604e57ef218ebb4","user":{"login":"tengpeng","id":2724786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjQ3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2724786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng","html_url":"https://github.com/tengpeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108185981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgxODU5ODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"tengpeng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tengpeng","id":2724786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjQ3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2724786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng","html_url":"https://github.com/tengpeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tengpeng/spark","description":"Mirror

The deprecated fine-grained driver is left as-is.\r\nThe driver metrics include e.g. frequency of RPCs to/from Mesos, the internal state tracking of tasks/agents, and durations for bringing up the tasks.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Analyzer throws an exception if you try to nest a generator. However, it special cases generators \"nested\" in an alias, and allows that. If you try to alias a generator twice, it is not caught by the special case, so an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nThis PR trims the unnecessary, non-top-level aliases, so that the generator is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs of now, stringToTimestamp function in DateTimeUtils creates a calendar instance on each call. This change maintains a thread-local timezone to calendar map, and creates just one calendar for each timezone. Whenever a calendar instance is queried given a timezone, it is looked-up inside the map, reinitialized and returned.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsing existing test cases.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently a \"StreamingQueryListener\" can only be registered programatically. We could have a new config \"spark.sql.streamingQueryListeners\" similar to  \"spark.sql.queryExecutionListeners\" and \"spark.extraListeners\" for users to register custom streaming listeners.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test and running example programs.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis removes the v2 optimizer rule for push-down and instead pushes filters and required columns when converting to a physical plan, as suggested by @marmbrus. This makes the v2 relation cleaner because the output and filters do not change in the logical plan.\r\n\r\nA side-effect of this change is that the stats from the logical (optimized) plan no longer reflect pushed filters and projection. This is a temporary state, until the planner gathers stats from the physical plan instead. An alternative to this approach is https://github.com/rdblue/spark/commit/9d3a11e68bca6c5a56a2be47fb09395350362ac5.\r\n\r\nThe first commit was proposed in #21262. This PR replaces #21262.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the Dataset API we may acquire resources which we cannot deallocate. This happens for broadcast joins. The broadcasted object is never destroyed and we rely on the garbage collection of broadcasted object to free it. In a general use case, this is a safe assumption, but when dynamic allocation is enabled, the current approach can lead to resource leakage.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when a Spark application is submitted on YARN with dynamic allocation enabled, we may leak disk space. Indeed, in such a scenario, when query with a broadcast join is executed, it is likely that we ask for new containers. These containers are used for the execution of the query and then killed. They may be killed before the broadcast object is GCed. In this case, the files which have been written are never removed (as the container is not alive anymore to remove them and YARN removes them only when the application ends).\r\n\r\nIn order to solve the above-mentioned issue, the PR proposes to add a `destroy` method to the `Dataset` class, which can be used to free all the resources which have been acquired in the plan execution. Eagerly destroying the acquired resources, they are freed before the containers are killed, avoiding (or at least reducing considerably) the problem.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-22036 we introduced the possibility to allow precision loss in arithmetic operations (according to the SQL standard). The implementation was drawn from Hive's one, where Decimals with a negative scale are not allowed in the operations.\r\n\r\nThe PR handles the case when the scale is negative, removing the assertion that it is not.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently `Union` has only unknown output partitioning. That said if the children are well partitioned (e.g., bucketed tables), we still run shuffling on the data on later operators such as aggregation.\r\n\r\nThis patch tries to better decide output partitioning for `Union` operator. So it can eliminate unnecessary shuffling, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval N = 10\r\n\r\nspark.range(N).selectExpr(\"id as key\", \"id % 2 as t1\", \"id % 3 as t2\").repartition(col(\"key\")).write.mode(\"overwrite\").bucketBy(3, \"key\").sortBy(\"t1\").saveAsTable(\"a1\")\r\nspark.range(N).selectExpr(\"id as key\", \"id % 2 as t1\", \"id % 3 as t2\").repartition(col(\"key\")).write.mode(\"overwrite\").bucketBy(3, \"key\").sortBy(\"t1\").saveAsTable(\"a2\")\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold\", -1)\r\n\r\nval df = sql(\"select key,count(*) from (select * from a1 union all select * from a2)z group by key\")\r\ndf.explain\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(3) HashAggregate(keys=[key#36L], functions=[count(1)])\r\n+- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[key#36L], functions=[partial_count(1)])\r\n   +- Union\r\n      :- *(1) Project [key#36L]\r\n      :  +- *(1) FileScan parquet default.a1[key#36L] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/root/repos/spark-1/spark-warehouse/a1], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<key:bigint>\r\n      +- *(2) Project [key#39L]\r\n         +- *(2) FileScan parquet default.a2[key#39L] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/root/repos/spark-1/spark-warehouse/a2], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<key:bigint>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a private API `zipRDDs` to `RDD`. Since `zipPartitions` asks a function to run on elements of rdds, it only supports fixed number of rdds. But for `Union`, the number of children is not fixed.\r\n\r\nThis optimization can be controlled by a SQL config `spark.sql.unionInSamePartition` which is false by default.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.","created_at":"2018-06-05T10:14:00Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:38Z","closed_at":"2018-07-16T22:15:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afb62d6a5da814c54ba8387a9fbf7f54de704f47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21498/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21498/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21498/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/69a70662c5d668ecaed3c8c5f0ecc53f33ab0682","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-24410","ref":"SPARK-24410","sha":"69a70662c5d668ecaed3c8c5f0ecc53f33ab0682","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTextSocketMicroBatchReader was no longer be compatible with netcat due to launching temporary reader for reading schema, and closing reader, and re-opening reader. While reliable socket server should be able to handle this without any issue, nc command normally can't handle multiple connections and simply exits when closing temporary reader.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes TextSocketMicroBatchReader to be compatible with netcat again, via deferring opening socket to the first call of planInputPartitions() instead of constructor.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test which fails on current and succeeds with the patch. And also manually tested.","created_at":"2018-06-05T08:53:43Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T22:23:55Z","closed_at":"2018-06-13T04:39:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fea95d46ce551a429e5f3cdda211dd729afd7ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21497/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21497/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21497/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d069dd009bac833ac5f1a61bd9f911d1e021e15c","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-24466","ref":"SPARK-24466","sha":"d069dd009bac833ac5f1a61bd9f911d1e021e15c","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nScala is upgraded to `2.11.12` and `2.12.6`. \r\n\r\nWe used `loadFIles()` in `ILoop` as a hook to initialize the Spark before REPL sees any files in Scala `2.11.8`. However, it was a hack, and it was not intended to be a public API, so it was removed in Scala `2.11.12`.\r\n\r\nFrom the discussion in Scala community, https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/10913 , we can use `initializeSynchronous` to initialize Spark instead. This PR implements the Spark initialization there.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Scala `2.11.12`'s `ILoop.scala`, in function `def startup()`, the first thing it calls is `printWelcome()`. As a result, Scala will call `printWelcome()` and `splash` before calling `initializeSynchronous`. \r\n\r\nThus, the Spark shell will allow users to type commends first, and then show the Spark UI URL. It's working, but it will change the Spark Shell interface as the following. \r\n\r\n```scala\r\n➜  apache-spark git:(scala-2.11.12) ✗ ./bin/spark-shell \r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel). For SparkR, use setLogLevel(newLevel).\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /___/ .__/\\_,_/_/ /_/\\_\\   version 2.4.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n      /_/\r\n         \r\nUsing Scala version 2.11.12 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_161)\r\nType in expressions to have them evaluated.\r\nType :help for more information.\r\n\r\nscala> Spark context Web UI available at http://192.168.1.169:4040\r\nSpark context available as 'sc' (master = local[*], app id = local-1528180279528).\r\nSpark session available as 'spark'.\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems there is no easy way to inject the Spark initialization code in the proper place as Scala doesn't provide a hook. Maybe @som-snytt can comment on this.\r\n\r\nThe following command is used to update the dep files. \r\n```scala\r\n./dev/test-dependencies.sh --replace-manifest\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add new RDDBarrier and BarrierTaskContext to support barrier scheduling in Spark. It also modifies how the job scheduling works to accommodate the new feature.\r\n\r\nNote: this is a prototype to facilitate the discussion. It's not meant for the final design or anything. It just shows one way that might works.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSimple unit test and integration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe error occurs when we are recovering from a failure in a no-data batch (say X) that has been planned (i.e. written to offset log) but not executed (i.e. not written to commit log). Upon recovery the following sequence of events happen.\r\n\r\n1. `MicroBatchExecution.populateStartOffsets` sets `currentBatchId` to X. Since there was no data in the batch, the `availableOffsets` is same as `committedOffsets`, so `isNewDataAvailable` is `false`.\r\n2. When `MicroBatchExecution.constructNextBatch` is called, ideally it should immediately return true because the next batch has already been constructed. However, the check of whether the batch has been constructed was `if (isNewDataAvailable) return true`. Since the planned batch is a no-data batch, it escaped this check and proceeded to plan the same batch X *once again*.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to have an explicit flag that signifies whether a batch has already been constructed or not. `populateStartOffsets` is going to set the flag appropriately.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen an executor's heartbeat is lost, we call scheduler.executorLost before we tell the backend to kill the executor. TaskSchedulerImpl asks the backend to revive offers in executorLost. If this is the only executor, it's possible the backend will offer it again to TaskSchedulerImpl, and the retried task is scheduled to this executor.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to call scheduler.executorLost after the executor is killed. At this point, the executor has been marked as pending-to-remove and won't be offered again.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case in HeartbeatReceiverSuite.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nspark.blacklist.killBlacklistedExecutors is defined as \r\n\r\n(Experimental) If set to \"true\", allow Spark to automatically kill, and attempt to re-create, executors when they are blacklisted. Note that, when an entire node is added to the blacklist, all of the executors on that node will be killed.\r\n\r\nI presume the killing of blacklisted executors only happens after the stage completes successfully and all tasks have completed or on fetch failures (updateBlacklistForFetchFailure/updateBlacklistForSuccessfulTaskSet). It is confusing because the definition states that the executor will be attempted to be recreated as soon as it is blacklisted. This is not true while the stage is in progress and an executor is blacklisted, it will not attempt to cleanup until the stage finishes.","created_at":"2018-05-31T22:20:37Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T18:59:39Z","closed_at":"2018-06-12T18:59:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42eb48e54e970ec1cb28477e6cc7ca45342ccecf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21475/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21475/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21475/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a654b4cfce4d0d8faa3ba6f14a3ba11dcc8ccd1","head":{"label":"redsanket:SPARK-24416","ref":"SPARK-24416","sha":"1a654b4cfce4d0d8faa3ba6f14a3ba11dcc8ccd1","user":{"login":"redsanket","id":8295799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTU3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8295799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket","html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39640326,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTY0MDMyNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"redsanket/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"redsanket","id":8295799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTU3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8295799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket","html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support schema in JSON format for the `from_json()` function in SQL as it has been already implemented in Scala DSL for example [there](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala#L3225-L3229):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval dataType = try {\r\n  DataType.fromJson(schema)\r\n} catch {\r\n  case NonFatal(_) => StructType.fromDDL(schema)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes will allow to specify `MapType` in SQL that's impossible at the moment: \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect from_json('{\"a\":1}', '{\"type\":\"map\", \"keyType\":\"string\", \"valueType\":\"integer\",\"valueContainsNull\":false}')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen comparing struct type values, it's a little hard to make the field names same. Simple queries like\r\n`SELECT (a, b) = (1, 2) FROM t` may fail because the field names do not match.\r\n\r\nIn Postgres, when comparing struct type values, it will do safe type coercion and ignore field name difference\r\n```\r\n# create table t(i smallint, j smallint);\r\nCREATE TABLE\r\n\r\n# select Row(i, j) = Row(1, 1) from t;                              \r\n ?column? \r\n----------\r\n t\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\n# select Row(i, j) < Row(1, 1) from t;\r\n ?column? \r\n----------\r\n f\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\n# select Row(i, j) = Row(j, i) from t;\r\n ?column? \r\n----------\r\n t\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR follows Postgres and accept structurally-equal types in comparison.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the test failures in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21442 .\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* check Hive and Presto.\r\n* think about array/map type. Postgres doesn't support type coercion for elements in array/map when comparison.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew test cases.","created_at":"2018-05-31T18:14:52Z","updated_at":"2020-01-12T00:07:28Z","closed_at":"2020-01-12T00:07:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4231e77ed66803ac722e5c263749f27cf053588","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3555e0fd1a8003af0e6a7694aab8999698aab9c4","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:equal","ref":"equal","sha":"3555e0fd1a8003af0e6a7694aab8999698aab9c4","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch exposes the estimation of size of cache (loadedMaps) in HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider as a custom metric of StateStore.\r\n\r\nThe rationalize of the patch is that state backed by HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider will consume more memory than the number what we can get from query status due to caching multiple versions of states. The memory footprint to be much larger than query status reports in situations where the state store is getting a lot of updates: while shallow-copying map incurs additional small memory usages due to the size of map entities and references, but row objects will still be shared across the versions. If there're lots of updates between batches, less row objects will be shared and more row objects will exist in memory consuming much memory then what we expect. \r\n\r\nWhile HDFSBackedStateStore refers loadedMaps in HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider directly, there would be only one `StateStoreWriter` which refers a StateStoreProvider, so the value is not exposed as well as being aggregated multiple times. Current state metrics are safe to aggregate for the same reason.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually.

Performed the same test after the change and verified the fix.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-23754 was fixed in #21383 by changing the UDF code to wrap the user function, but this required a hack to save its argspec. This PR reverts this change and fixes the `StopIteration` bug in the worker\r\n\r\n## How does this work?\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem is that when an user-supplied function raises a `StopIteration`, pyspark might stop processing data, if this function is used in a for-loop. The solution is to catch `StopIteration`s exceptions and re-raise them as `RuntimeError`s, so that the execution fails and the error is reported to the user. This is done using the `fail_on_stopiteration` wrapper, in different ways depending on where the function is used:\r\n - In RDDs, the user function is wrapped in the driver, because this function is also called in the driver itself.\r\n - In SQL UDFs, the function is wrapped in the worker, since all processing happens there. Moreover, the worker needs the signature of the user function, which is lost when wrapping it, but passing this signature to the worker requires a not so nice hack.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSame tests, plus tests for pandas

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a debugging log for YARN-specific credential providers which is loaded by service loader mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to debug if it's actually loaded or not. I had to explicitly set the deprecated configuration and check if that's actually being loaded.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe change scope is manually tested. Logs are like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing the following builtin delegation token providers: hadoopfs, hive, hbase.\r\nUsing the following YARN-specific credential providers: yarn-test.\r\n```","created_at":"2018-05-31T06:45:10Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:43:41Z","closed_at":"2018-06-01T00:49:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"354606637c1cf616903001d608b7857df3775aaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/210ac1447d6eb6fbf4107e2a7ec9026a98b770a8","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:minor-log","ref":"minor-log","sha":"210ac1447d6eb6fbf4107e2a7ec9026a98b770a8","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes are proposed\r\nMake sure that `StopIteration`s raised in users' code do not silently interrupt processing by spark, but are raised as exceptions to the users. The users' functions are wrapped in `safe_iter` (in `shuffle.py`), which re-raises `StopIteration`s as `RuntimeError`s\r\n\r\n## How were the changes tested\r\nUnit tests, making sure that the exceptions are indeed raised. I am not sure how to check whether a `Py4JJavaError` contains my exception, so I simply looked for the exception message in the java exception's `toString`. Can you propose a better way?\r\n\r\nThis is my original work, licensed in the same way as spark\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAuthor: e-dorigatti <emilio.dorigatti@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nCloses #21383 from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor a partitioned and bucketed table. With the increasing number of partitions, the amount of data is getting larger and larger. Reading this table always uses the `bucket number` of tasks.\r\nThis PR changes the logic to `bucket number` * `partition number` when reading partitioned and bucketed table.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual tests.\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(10000).selectExpr(\r\n  \"id as key\",\r\n  \"id % 5 as t1\",\r\n  \"id % 10 as p\").repartition(5,

patch eliminates duplicate strings that come from the 'path' field of\r\njava.io.File objects created by FileSegmentManagedBuffer. That is, we want\r\nto avoid the situation when multiple File instances for the same pathname\r\n\"foo/bar\" are created, each with a separate copy of the \"foo/bar\" String\r\ninstance. In some scenarios such duplicate strings may waste a lot of memory\r\n(~ 10% of the heap). To avoid that, we intern the pathname with\r\nString.intern(), and before that we make sure that it's in a normalized\r\nform (contains no \"//\", \"///\" etc.) Otherwise, the code in java.io.File\r\nwould normalize it later, creating a new \"foo/bar\" String copy.\r\nUnfortunately, the normalization code that java.io.File uses internally\r\nis in the package-private class java.io.FileSystem, so we cannot call it\r\nhere directly.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded code to ExternalShuffleBlockResolver.getFile(), that normalizes and then interns the pathname string before passing it to the File() constructor.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-29T20:16:55Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T17:28:36Z","closed_at":"2018-06-03T04:11:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6ac87f3f23326b1e56a659137dd5d9aeea5aca1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21456/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21456/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21456/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f49512b61a6d5b73f4d5966c557867ee55be0b5a","head":{"label":"countmdm:misha/spark-24356","ref":"misha/spark-24356","sha":"f49512b61a6d5b73f4d5966c557867ee55be0b5a","user":{"login":"countmdm","id":6394099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6394099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm","html_url":"https://github.com/countmdm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":135335771,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzUzMzU3NzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"countmdm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"countmdm","id":6394099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6394099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm","html_url":"https://github.com/countmdm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/countmdm/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `Dataset.join` we have a small hack for resolving ambiguity in the column name for self-joins. The current code supports only `EqualTo`, but we may have other conditions involving columns on self joins: in general any `BinaryComparison` can be specified and faces the same issue.\r\n\r\nThe PR extends the fix to all `BinaryComparison`s.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

s\"\"\"SELECT corr(DISTINCT x, y), corr(DISTINCT y, x), count(*)\r\n     | FROM (VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 2)) t(x, y)\r\n   \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException\r\nYou hit a query analyzer bug. Please report your query to Spark user mailing list.\r\n```\r\nThe root cause is that `RewriteDistinctAggregates` can't detect multiple distinct aggregations if they have the same argument set. This pr modified code so that `RewriteDistinctAggregates` could count the number of aggregate expressions with `isDistinct=true`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTwo new rules in the logical plan optimizers are added.\r\n\r\n1. When there is only one element in the **`Collection`**, the\r\nphysical plan will be optimized to **`EqualTo`**, so predicate\r\npushdown can be used.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    profileDF.filter( $\"profileID\".isInCollection(Set(6))).explain(true)\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n      |== Physical Plan ==\r\n      |*(1) Project [profileID#0]\r\n      |+- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(profileID#0) && (profileID#0 = 6))\r\n      |   +- *(1) FileScan parquet [profileID#0] Batched: true, Format: Parquet,\r\n      |     PartitionFilters: [],\r\n      |     PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(profileID), EqualTo(profileID,6)],\r\n      |     ReadSchema: struct<profileID:int>\r\n    \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. When the **`Collection`** is empty, and the input is nullable, the\r\nlogical plan will be simplified to\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    profileDF.filter( $\"profileID\".isInCollection(Set())).explain(true)\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n      |== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\n      |Filter if (isnull(profileID#0)) null else false\r\n      |+- Relation[profileID#0] parquet\r\n    \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n1. For multiple conditions with numbers less than certain thresholds,\r\nwe should still allow predicate pushdown.\r\n2. Optimize the **`In`** using **`tableswitch`** or **`lookupswitch`**\r\nwhen the numbers of the categories are low, and they are **`Int`**,\r\n**`Long`**.\r\n3. The default immutable hash trees set is slow for query, and we\r\nshould do benchmark for using different set implementation for faster\r\nquery.\r\n4. **`filter(if (condition) null else false)`** can be optimized to false.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCouple new tests are added.","created_at":"2018-05-28T07:30:20Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T17:40:11Z","closed_at":"2018-07-16T22:37:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d5dc4f089c35fb5eda7726c04be331ece834844","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9174a30b092740284250002f5a5fee50eadfc754","head":{"label":"dbtsai:optimize-in","ref":"optimize-in","sha":"9174a30b092740284250002f5a5fee50eadfc754","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34716514,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDcxNjUxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dbtsai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR removes a restriction for element types of array type which exists in `from_json` for the root type. Currently, the function can handle only arrays of structs. Even array of primitive types is disallowed. The PR allows arrays of any types currently supported by JSON datasource. Here is an example of an array of a primitive type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nscala> val df = Seq(\"[1, 2, 3]\").toDF(\"a\")\r\nscala> val schema = new ArrayType(IntegerType, false)\r\nscala> val arr = df.select(from_json($\"a\", schema))\r\nscala> arr.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- jsontostructs(a): array (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- element: integer (containsNull = true)\r\n```\r\nand result of converting of the json string to the `ArrayType`:\r\n```\r\nscala> arr.show\r\n+----------------+\r\n|jsontostructs(a)|\r\n+----------------+\r\n|       [1, 2, 3]|\r\n+----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a few positive and negative tests:\r\n- array of primitive types\r\n- array of arrays\r\n- array of structs\r\n- array of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we create a `RelationalGroupedDataset` or a `KeyValueGroupedDataset` we set its child to the `logicalPlan` of the `DataFrame` we need to aggregate. Since the `logicalPlan` is already analyzed, we should not analyze it again. But this happens when the new plan of the aggregate is analyzed.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior in most of the cases is likely to produce no harm, but in other cases re-analyzing an analyzed plan can change it, since the analysis is not idempotent. This can cause issues like the one described in the JIRA (missing to find a cached plan).\r\n\r\nThe PR adds an `AnalysisBarrier` to the `logicalPlan` which is used as child of `RelationalGroupedDataset` or a `KeyValueGroupedDataset`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded UT\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-25T14:10:42Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T14:16:42Z","closed_at":"2018-05-28T04:13:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9975bb23dc9629676085a1234763edc8a27c952b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/68e398dcc60d1cd3f4871369149f23f607789a4e","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-24373","ref":"SPARK-24373","sha":"68e398dcc60d1cd3f4871369149f23f607789a4e","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, a `pandas_udf` of type `PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP` will assign the resulting columns based on index of the return pandas.DataFrame.  If a new DataFrame is returned and constructed using a dict, then the order of the columns could be arbitrary and be different than the defined schema for the UDF.  If the schema types still match, then no error will be raised and the user will see column names and column data mixed up.\r\n\r\nThis change will first try to assign columns using the return type field names.  If a KeyError occurs, then the column index is checked if it is string based. If so, then the error is raised as it is most likely a naming mistake, else it will fallback to assign columns by position and raise a TypeError if the field types do not match.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test that returns a new DataFrame with column order different than the schema.\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-24T19:32:36Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T17:55:22Z","closed_at":"2018-06-24T01:33:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6180562200c6dbb39f2941fd78936c53cdedcd2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d2ced626f3ed9abf8100e5a83b007b8c8cfad99","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:arrow-grouped-map-mixesup-cols-SPARK-24324","ref":"arrow-grouped-map-mixesup-cols-SPARK-24324","sha":"2d2ced626f3ed9abf8100e5a83b007b8c8cfad99","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror
