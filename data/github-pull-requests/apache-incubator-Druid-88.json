In RealtimePlumber, sink is bound to an interval, then maintain a Set inside the sink to hold all values of dedupColumn, so dedup doesn't happen across sinks\r\n3. when sink.add(InputRow) called, check the value of dedupColumn of this inputRow whether it is in the Set, if so, reject with return rowCount as -2\r\n4. RealtimeManager increase the ingest/events/duplicate count metric\r\n5. the dedup Set is cleared when the sink is no longer writable:\r\n  5.1 when mergeAndPush which is called at fix rate\r\n  5.2 when got a new sink then try to clearDedupCache for the older sink in case merge process is slow in 5.1\r\n\r\nWhy need a primary key?\r\nIf we compare each columns to distinguish duplication, we need to setup a sink level timeAndDims which costs lots of heap memory.\r\nInstead we ask user to prepare a 'pk' column as dedupColumn (usually, pk is built on several columns like {timestamp, user_id, item_id, order_id}) in their ETL process like in storm, spark, flink, user is glad to do so to gain the ability of dedup, \r\nOf course, 'pk' is no need to be in dimension list, it's only for dedup.\r\n\r\nLimitation:\r\nif the dedupColumn is string type column, whose value maybe md5, use it's long type hashcode (use BKDRHash algorithm) instead to judge whether it is a duplicate row, so there's very small change to throw away a row which is not duplicate. But I think it is worth to do this trade off to reduce heap cost to avoid OOM if maxRowsInMemory is a big

was intended to fix an issue with Kafka indexing service where a task would push segments to deep storage and then fail, and then the subsequent retry task would attempt to push its segment (which contains a different set of offsets from the first task) and publish the metadata, but the push would not happen because the segment data already existed in deep storage. In this scenario, the metadata (most importantly the offset cursors) would not match what's actually in the segment and exactly-once semantics would be violated.\r\n\r\nThis was fixed by supporting file overwriting in deep storage, but it turns out that there are other cases where overwriting the existing segment is undesired behavior. As an example (which may or may not be happening in practice), there could be a task which pushes its segments and publishes metadata but then fails before it can notify the supervisor that it is done. If the supervisor then creates a retry task to attempt again, the task will eventually fail when the transactional metadata commit fails, but by this point it will have already pushed its version of the segments into deep storage, overwriting the good set of segments there. This will lead to a similar situation as the previous case, where the same segment ID could have different data on historicals and in deep storage, and where Kafka messages can be duplicated or missed.\r\n\r\nThe cleanest way to handle all these cases is to have each Kafka task write its segments to a separate location in deep storage so that the metadata published definitely matches the segment set and there's no interaction between tasks. If a task pushes and then the metadata publish fails, it will attempt to clean up the orphaned segments, but it is expected that in some unhandled exception cases, the segments may remain in deep storage and may need to be cleaned up

users have encountered issues when running Druid 0.12.0 against a Hadoop cluster with namenode HA enabled, where the mapper encounters an UnknownHostException when it tries to interpret the logical nameservice string as a hostname (e.g.: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/5552). The users encountering issue also report that their hadoop ingestion was working in Druid 0.10.0 with the same hadoop configs.\r\n\r\nIn a local test environment, I was able to run a hadoop ingestion task successfully using namenode HA (https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/5552#issuecomment-383743216), so this issue might be a misconfiguration in some cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, in another case, we observed this issue in a customer environment where the Hadoop .xml files in the Druid classpath were correctly configured for namenode HA, but the mapper failed to pick up the configurations. The root cause was unclear. \r\n\r\nGiven that the mapper does not actually need the DataSegmentPusher, this PR is a workaround that lazily evaluates the the `fullyQualifiedStorageDirectory` variable in HdfsDataSegmentPusher, to unblock users who are encountering this issue, until a more complete understanding of the issue is reached.\r\n\r\nI suspect that these users did not encounter issues in 0.10.0 because in that version HadoopDruidIndexerConfig did not have the DataSegmentPusher as a field (see https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4116).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-24T02:10:33Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T23:34:59Z","closed_at":"2018-04-29T04:07:40Z","merged_at":"2018-04-29T04:07:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"513fab77d96202bcee8c68f0ab927804d4400c0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

more than one load rule applies to a segment, the first one that applies will take effect and the remainder will be ignored. However, the logic in `getReplicationStatus()` used by loadstatus?full was such that it would calculate expected segments based on all the rules that applied, leading to counts based on segments being expected to be also loaded according to lesser priority rules. Hence, if you had something like this:\r\n\r\nSegments:\r\n2018-01-01/2018-01-02\r\n2018-01-02/2018-01-03\r\n2017-01-01/2017-01-02\r\n\r\nAnd your load rules were:\r\n- Load interval 2018-01-01/P1M in hot tier\r\n- Load forever in cold tier\r\n\r\n`loadstatus?full` would show: `{\"hot\":{\"datasource\":0},\"cold\":{\"datasource\":2}}`\r\n\r\nTest took about a hundred times longer than the fix.\r\n\r\nRecommend for backport to 0.12.1 since a broken loadstatus potentially affects monitoring and rolling update scripting and the fix is low risk.","created_at":"2018-04-22T04:01:32Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:38:50Z","closed_at":"2018-04-23T19:41:17Z","merged_at":"2018-04-23T19:41:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"55b003e5e82cc11430d54e857a723ac9d4b52845","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/26/labels","id":3253774,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzI1Mzc3NA==","number":26,"title":"0.12.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":63,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-09T19:19:05Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T22:02:59Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-07-03T20:20:16Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/064ed65c3e23e1a81919d6c922baa40a04182256","head":{"label":"dclim:loadstatus-fix","ref":"loadstatus-fix","sha":"064ed65c3e23e1a81919d6c922baa40a04182256","user":{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ca3f833426231623cd7eb47a6eff9bd2886b6a87","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":6358188,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzU4MTg4","name":"druid","full_name":"apache/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/s

in `DruidCoordinator` determines how many segments need to be loaded per-datasource by retrieving the list of all segments from metadata, then asks each server for its segment inventory and removes the server segments from the set returned from metadata:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      // remove loaded segments\r\n      for (DruidServer druidServer : serverInventoryView.getInventory()) {\r\n        final DruidDataSource loadedView = druidServer.getDataSource(dataSource.getName());\r\n        if (loadedView != null) {\r\n          segments.removeAll(loadedView.getSegments());\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current code can perform badly when a server has the entire set of segments for a datasource.\r\n\r\nThis is the code for `AbstractSet.removeAll()`:\r\n```\r\n    public boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c) {\r\n        Objects.requireNonNull(c);\r\n        boolean modified = false;\r\n\r\n        if (size() > c.size()) {\r\n            for (Iterator<?> i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )\r\n                modified |= remove(i.next());\r\n        } else {\r\n            for (Iterator<?> i = iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {\r\n                if (c.contains(i.next())) {\r\n                    i.remove();\r\n                    modified = true;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return modified;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that situation, the else block will be used, and this is a problem because `loadedView.getSegments()` is the values collection of a ConcurrentHashMap, and its contains() method does a full traversal of the map:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public Collection<DataSegment> getSegments()\r\n  {\r\n    return Collections.unmodifiableCollection(idToSegmentMap.values());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n...\r\n    public static <T> Collection<T> unmodifiableCollection(Collection<? extends T> c) {\r\n        return new UnmodifiableCollection<>(c);\r\n    }\r\n    public boolean contains(Object o)   {return c.contains(o);}\r\n...\r\n    static final class ValuesView<K,V> extends CollectionView<K,V,V>\r\n        implements Collection<V>, java.io.Serializable {\r\n\r\n        ValuesView(ConcurrentHashMap<K,V> map) { super(map); }\r\n\r\n        public final boolean contains(Object o) {\r\n            return map.containsValue(o);\r\n        }\r\n...\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns {@code true} if this map maps one or more keys to the\r\n     *

public boolean containsValue(Object value) {\r\n        if (value == null)\r\n            throw new NullPointerException();\r\n        Node<K,V>[] t;\r\n        if ((t = table) != null) {\r\n            Traverser<K,V> it = new Traverser<K,V>(t, t.length, 0, t.length);\r\n            for (Node<K,V> p; (p = it.advance()) != null; ) {\r\n                V v;\r\n                if ((v = p.val) == value || (v != null && value.equals(v)))\r\n                    return true;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following benchmark (included in the

was failing `First` request from the clients.\r\nAfter authentication we were setting the cookie properly but not\r\nsetting the the authenticated flag in the request. This PR fixes that.\r\n\r\nAdditional Fixes -\r\n1. Excluded paths config - It was not working as expected. Requests for excluded paths were still failing. Fixed this by adding authentication result with anonymous user.\r\n2. Removing of Unused SpnegoFilterConfig - replaced by\r\nKerberosAuthenticator\r\n2. removed unused internalClientKeytab and principal configs from KerberosAuthenticator\r\n3. Fix docs accordingly and add docs for configuring an escalated\r\nclient.\r\n\r\nReproducing the Issue - \r\n- Configure Kerberos Security \r\n- Perform Kinit on client side and send an HTTP request to any druid endpoint\r\n- Druid returns unauthorized error  with a set-cookie flag. ----- HERE druid should have returned a 200 OK\r\n- Using the cookie on subsequent requests works fine.

change](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/5528/files#diff-87398cf804a130e66498c79706348296L701). Note that this doesn't happen on all coordinator installations with this patch, as some seem to be functioning correctly. We haven't isolated the steps or environment to reproduce this exactly, it is likely related to some combination of jvm versions and possibly which extensions are loaded. It may be a jvm bug related to lambda this binding affecting some versions? \r\n\r\nRegardless, it seems best to revert this change  until we can determine the cause and ensure it doesn't happen anymore.","created_at":"2018-04-06T20:03:19Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:38:45Z","closed_at":"2018-04-06T21:18:56Z","merged_at":"2018-04-06T21:18:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea4f8544fb33dac91d88af08d5f5892a74e12b8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/27","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/27","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/27/labels","id":3412199,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzQxMjE5OQ==","number":27,"title":"0.12.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":76,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-08T22:27:59Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T19:59:00Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-08-13T19:59:00Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/dd3c6aecbbf9affea1461e55412387f24848c9ba","head":{"label":"clintropolis:fix-lambda-explosion","ref":"fix-lambda-explosion","sha":"dd3c6aecbbf9affea1461e55412387f24848c9ba","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122282812,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIyODI4MTI=","name":"druid","full_name":"clintropolis/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis/druid","description":"Column

Target\r\nTo optimize query.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nThere are two extensions namely materialized-view-maintenance and materialized-view-selection. \r\n\r\nIn materialized-view-maintenance, `MaterializedViewSupervisor` is used to generate or drop derived datasource segments and keep the timeline's consistency of base datasource and derived datasource.\r\n\r\nIn materialized-view-selection, `MaterializedViewQuery` is implemented to do materialized-view-selection for topn/groupby/timeseries query.\r\n\r\nThe detailed design and discussion is in issue #5304\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n1. [Loading materialized-view-maintenance and materialized-view-selection](http://druid.io/docs/latest/operations/including-extensions.html). Notices: materialized-view-selection can only be loaded when start broker.\r\n2. Submit a MaterializedViewSupervisor. e.g.:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\" : \"derivativeDataSource\",\r\n  \"baseDataSource\": \"wikiticker\",\r\n  \"dimensionsSpec\":{\r\n            \"dimensions\" : [\r\n              \"isUnpatrolled\",\r\n              \"metroCode\",\r\n              \"namespace\",\r\n              \"page\",\r\n              \"regionIsoCode\",\r\n              \"regionName\",\r\n              \"user\"\r\n            ]\r\n          },\r\n    \"metricsSpec\" : [\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\" : \"count\",\r\n          \"type\" : \"count\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\" : \"added\",\r\n          \"type\" : \"longSum\",\r\n          \"fieldName\" : \"added\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n  \"tuningConfig\": {\r\n      \"type\" : \"hadoop\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Send a MaterializedViewQuery. e.g.:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"queryType\": \"view\",\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"queryType\": \"groupBy\",\r\n        \"dataSource\": \"wikiticker\",\r\n
