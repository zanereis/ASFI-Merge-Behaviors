is far more complex than it should be because of\r\nautoapi problems with parallel execution. Unfortunately autoapi\r\ndoes not cope well when several autoapis are run in parallel on\r\nthe same code - even if they are run in separate processes and\r\nfor different packages. Autoapi uses common _doctree and _api\r\ndirectories generated in the source code and they override\r\neach other if two or more of them run in parallel.\r\n\r\nThe solution in this PR is mostly applicable for CI environment.\r\nIn this case we have docker images that have been already built\r\nusing current sources so we can safely run separate docker\r\ncontainers without mapping the sources and run generation\r\nof documentation separtely and independently in each container.\r\n\r\nThis seems to work really well, speeding up docs generation\r\n2x in public GitHub runners and 8x in self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\nPublic runners:\r\n\r\n* 27m -> 11m\r\n\r\nSelf-hosted runners:\r\n\r\n* 27m -> < 8m\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the upcoming apache-beam change where mock library will be\r\nremoved from install dependencies, we will be able to remove\r\n`apache-beam` exclusion in our CI scripts.

commit adds the feature to allow users to set one of the following modes, the\r\n scheduler will list and sort the dag files to decide the parsing order.:\r\n\r\n- `modified_time`: Sort by modified time of the files. This is useful on large scale to parse the recently modified DAGs first.\r\n- `random_seeded_by_host`: Sort randomly across multiple Schedulers but with same order on the same host. This is useful when running with Scheduler in HA mode where each scheduler can parse different DAG files.\r\n- `alphabetical`: Sort by filename\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR is to provide authentication to the new UI. The implementation uses the existing Flask Appbuilder authentication method configurations.\r\nFirst, the react app checks the configuration on the server by sending a GET request to `api/v1/auth-info`. This endpoint returns information about the configured auth method. With the information, the react app can then present a login form to the user if necessary.\r\n\r\nBelow I explain the flow for OAuth\r\n\r\nOAuth\r\nThis authentication uses two endpoints, one is used to get the authorization URL while the other is used for verification and sign-in. The react app makes a GET request to `api/v1/auth-oauth/{provider}` with the provider name and redirect url e.g `api/v1/auth-oauth/google?redirect_url=http:localhost:5000`, the endpoint responds with authorization URL which the react app will redirect users to. \r\nWhen the user is authenticated by the provider, the provider will redirect user to the redirect_url provided by the react app. The react app should handle the redirection, and make a GET request to server at `api/v1/oauth-authorized/{provider}` with the state returned from the provider. If everything is OK, user is logged in and user data is returned.\r\n\r\nThe one advantage we can get using the refresh token is to get ride of auth_backend.\r\n\r\nOpenID is not currently implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

breaks the loops sending callbacks to the multiprocessing pipe into size 100 batches, and call `DagFileProcessorAgent.heartbeat()` after each pipe (which would call `Pipe.recv()`) to consume the pipe. This avoids the pipe from becoming full, which would make `Pipe.send()` block and deadlocking the process.\r\n\r\n`Pipe.send()` is called in two code paths, (interestingly) represented exactly by the two py-spy traces available in #7935.\r\n\r\nThe way I do this is pretty naive, but represents the direction I think the issue should be resolved. I don’t really understand what the database calls do in `_do_scheduling` and `_process_executor_events`, and therefore have no idea if it’s OK to call `self.processor_agent.heartbeat()` interleaving those database calls (previously `heartbeat()` is only called after all those database calls are done).\r\n\r\nResolves #7935? There’s actually another separate issue described in it regarding the Redis worker being deadlocked. But this is no longer an issue according to @ashb (https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/7935#issuecomment-784950133), and indeed all reports on that one is against 1.10.x, so I’m putting it off (and honestly I’m not sure how that one should be handled; that may need to involve some Redis internals).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/13479\r\n\r\nAdded task_group decorator which can be used to create taskgroup from python callable. Inside python callable tasks can be grouped by calling tasks (python callable ) created with task decorator.\r\n\r\n\r\n- taskgroup decorator takes both optional and keyword argument which are passed to Constructor of TaskGroup class.\r\n\r\n- TaskGroup can be created with one of following syntax\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@task_group\r\n@task_group()\r\n@task_group(group_id='group_name')\r\n```\r\n\r\n- TaskGroup class  constructor takes one mandatory argument group_id, if not given in decorator it sets group_id to python callable name.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a simple example demonstrating use of taskgroup decorator grouping multiple tasks.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@task\r\ndef task_1(value):\r\n  return f'[ Task1 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_2(value):\r\n  print(f'[ Task2 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n\r\n@task_group\r\ndef section_1(value):\r\n  return task_2(task_1(value))\r\n```\r\n\r\ntask_group decorator utilizes existing TaskGroup context manager currently used for creating TaskGroup, which means we can create nested taskgroup by created nested callable. Following is an example demonstrating use of nested taskgroup.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@task\r\ndef task_start():\r\n    return '[Task_start]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_end():\r\n    print(f'[ Task_End ]')\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_1(value):\r\n    return f'[ Task1 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_2(value):\r\n    print(f'[ Task2 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_3(value):\r\n    return f'[ Task3 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_4(value):\r\n    print(f'[ Task4 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n@task_group\r\ndef section_1(value):\r\n\r\n    @task_group\r\n    def section_2(value2):\r\n        return task_4(task_3(value2))\r\n\r\n    op1 = task_2(task_1(value))\r\n    return section_2(op1) \r\n```\r\n\r\nDedicated test cases for taskgroup decorator is created in file \r\n/tests/utils/test_task_group_decorator.py\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent changes \r\n\r\n- Added logic to append suffix to duplicate group_id.\r\n\r\ncloses: #11870\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

838:59:59.000000\r\n      - [ ] **Shall I raise an exception when `timedelta.total_seconds() > 86399.99999(9)`?\r\n        This PR implicitly raises an `OverflowError: date value out of range` when `timedelta.total_seconds() < 0`.**\r\n\r\n- Supported output format:\r\n  - https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-json#limitations\r\n    > When you load JSON or CSV data, values in TIMESTAMP columns must use a dash (-) separator for the date portion of the timestamp, and the date must be in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day). The hh:mm:ss (hour-minute-second) portion of the timestamp must use a colon (:) separator.\r\n  - https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-json#details_of_loading_json_data\r\n    > If you provide a schema, BigQuery also accepts Unix Epoch time for timestamp values. However, schema autodetection will not detect this case, and will treat the value as a numeric or string type instead.\r\n\r\nWhen no `schema` provided, the current version of the operator assumes that MySQL's DATETIME and DATE values becoming BigQuery's TIMESTAMP, which doesn't accept Unix Epoch integer unless the downstream `gcs_to_bigquery` actually takes the output of `_write_local_schema_file()`.\r\n\r\nShould there be a `schema`, the current version of the operator sends integers and floats to BigQuery's DATETIME/TIMESTAMP and TIME, respectively. Issues are:\r\n- For DATETIME, BigQuery will throw errors;\r\n- For TIMESTAMP, although BigQuery accepts Unix Epoch integer in this case, `calendar.timegm()` will still cause troubles (unless the downstream `gcs_to_bigquery` uses a connection that switches to legacy SQL of BigQuery);\r\n  ```python\r\n  >>> calendar.timegm((1000,1,1,0,0,0))\r\n  -30610224000\r\n  ```\r\n- For TIME, BigQuery may silently convert to incorrect values.\r\n\r\nAs for DATE, if the `schema` is indeed sent to the downstream `gcs_to_bigquery`, then the current version will work. Otherwise, it will still encounter issues of BigQuery's integer-to-TIMESTAMP rejection and negative integers from `timege()` for edge cases.\r\n\r\nA side note:\r\nI suppose some usages might have been designed for BigQuery's legacy SQL dialect. However, since `gcs_to_bigquery` doesn't explicitly support it (only one line detects it for `escaped_table_name`), and standard SQL dialect is the default for Python library, it might be safe to follow standard SQL dialect's requirements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

we check whether we should rebuild image, we check if the\r\nmd5sum of some important files changed - which would trigger\r\nquestion whether to rebuild the image or not (because of\r\nchanged dependencies which need to be installed). This\r\nhappens for example when package.json or yarn.lock changes.\r\n\r\nPreviously, all the important files had distinct names, so\r\nwe stored the md5 hashes of those files with just filenames +.md5sum\r\nbut they were flattened to a single directory. Unfortunately,\r\nas of #14927 (merged with failing build) we had two package.json\r\nand two yarn.locks and it caused overwriting of md5hash of one\r\nby the other. This triggered unnecessary rebuilding of the image\r\nin CI part which resulted in failure (because of Apache Beam\r\ndependency problem).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by adding parent directory to the name of\r\nthe md5sum file (so we have www-package.json and ui-package.json)\r\nnow. Those important files change very rarely so this incident\r\nshould not happen again but we added some comments preventing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

The problem basically is, that currently only `from airflow.models import DAG` is recognized, but it's not unlikely, that e.g. `from airflow import models` followed by `models.DAG(...)` is used.\r\nThis PR recognizes all ways of importing / using the DAG class, as long as it is not renamed (e.g. `from airflow.models import DAG as AirflowDAG`).","created_at":"2021-03-24T14:32:42Z","updated_at":"2021-05-23T00:08:05Z","closed_at":"2021-05-23T00:08:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb70c54a30ae3f9f09b20e2803f9268812c423d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

cluster in a different project).\r\n\r\nIn our case, this led to 404s when trying to submit jobs, as the operator incorrectly assumed that the dataproc cluster was in the same project as the service account used to submit the job. \r\n\r\nAdding an optional override, if the project_id is left unspecified it will fallback to the old behaviour. \r\n\r\nI also understand that these operators are now

is one of two issues mentioned in #13287 . The issue is trivial one: only `false` case sensitive was taken into account, however, the Airflow config allows many more options for the boolean False.\r\nThis fix is basically a replacement of the case sensitive check for `false` by the same logic `getboolean()` uses. Using `getboolean()` itself seems not to be a good solution, since it throws an Exception if there is a blank value in the
