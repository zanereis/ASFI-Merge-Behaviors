option to pass extra configs is essential, for example - when working with a proxy (ex socks) to authenticate as a service principal using `ClientSecretCredential`.

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3917/\r\n\r\nThe fix improved sanitizing of the URLs and until Python 3.10 and 3.11 get released, we need to add the sanitization ourselves to pass tests on all versions.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve security of airflow users and make the tests work regardless whether the users have latest Python versions released, we add extra sanitisation step to the URL to apply the standard WHATWG specification.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR allows the S3KeySensor to be run in deferrable mode. I refactored the existing S3KeySensor to pull out the API calls, and leave a common `process_files` method that is used in both the deferrable and non-deferrable case. This reduces a lot of the code duplication. \r\n\r\nSome duplication is unavoidable - like writing the `head_object_async` and `get_file_metadata_async`, but where possible, I tried code duplication to a minimum. \r\n\r\nThe unit tests for the S3KeySensorTrigger follow the same pattern of testing as the S3KeySensor.\r\n\r\n@sunank200 @ephraimbuddy @pankajkoti \r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

idea for system tests is as follows:\r\n\r\n- add `VariableTransport` that will push OpenLineage events to `Variable` with key `<DAG_ID>.<TASK_ID>.event.<EVENT_TYPE>`.\r\n- System tests DAGs will be configured to use this transport\r\n- then, newly added `OpenLineageTestOperator` will compare the `expected` events with the ones that are stored in Variables.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds those components, as well as OL support for `BigQueryGetDataOperator` and OL support for system test utilizing it. \r\n\r\nPR is based on previous PR: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31293 - only second commit

broke existing functionality and did not update the documentation for the newly enabled functionality.\r\n\r\nThe Spark Sensor no longer works, XCOM no longer works on the Operator itself, and the Operator does not fail when the Spark job fails.\r\n\r\nRather than attempt to fix or resolve the current implementation, I am reverting to the existing, documented implementation.\r\n\r\nI would propose creating a _new_ Operator with alternative functionality (one which does not need a Sensor, copies logs, etc.) if that is desired.\r\n\r\ncloses:

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What's changed\r\n1. add `deferrable` attribute to base operator\r\n2. add `DEFAULT_DEFERRABLE` for toggling deferrable mode globally\r\n3. change the default value of `deferrable` attribute in existing operators to `DEFAULT_DEFERRABLE`\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nMany operators [[1]](#operators)[[2]](#prs) can run in deferrable mode by setting `deferrable` attribute to true. Therefore, we suggest adding this attribute to the base operator. Additionally, we want to enable users to easily activate the deferrable mode for all tasks. To achieve this, we introduce the `DEFAULT_DEFERRABLE` configuration, which can be loaded from `operators.default_deferrable` in airflow.cfg or set through the environment variable `AIRFLOW__OPERATORS__DEFAULT_DERFERRABLE`. The default value is set to false to maintain the original behavior.\r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility\r\nFor users not using the latest airflow (which have `DEFAULT_DEFERRABLE` in `airflow.models.abstractoperator`), the following code is used.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    from airflow.models.abstractoperator import DEFAULT_DEFERRABLE\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    DEFAULT_DEFERRABLE = conf.getboolean(\"operators\", \"default_deferrable\", fallback=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother solution I'm thinking of is\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self,\r\n        *,\r\n        ...,\r\n        deferrable: bool = conf.getboolean(\"operators\", \"default_deferrable\", fallback=False)\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n <summary><a id=\"operators\">[1] List of operators with deferrable attribute</a></summary>\r\n \r\n1.

case MSSQL tests are run on public runners, they often produce flake tests due to some race conditions that are difficult to fix.\r\n\r\nThe issue for the flake tests is captured in #31575\r\n\r\nLikely the race conditions are resulting from attempt to run only one scheduler loop and they are not impacting production. Also the MSSQL tests are rarely run on public runners - only for PRS that have \"full-tests-needed\" set, so slowing down the tests in those cases is better than having flakes.\r\n\r\nThis PR forces parallelism = 1 for MSSQL tests in case they are run on public runners in an attempt to get rid of the flake tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

are couple of changes needed to make our CI works for\r\nPRs done internally in a private repository.\r\n\r\n1) When you run PR to the same repository, the images can be built\r\nwithout \"pull_request_target\" workflow - they can be built\r\nin \"test\" workflow. The check we had hard-coded it to check\r\nagainst \"apache/airflow\" repository, but the check will work for\r\nnon apache/airflow repos by just comparing base and target repositories.\r\nIf they are the same, it means that PR is done to own repository and\r\nit should be fine to build images in-workflow.\r\n\r\n2) The private repos require authentication before pulling the image\r\nfrom repository - this is also fixed in this PR as commands that\r\nonly pulled the image did not require to authenticate before, but now\r\nthey have to authenticate. It turns out that passing --username being\r\nactor might cause authentication to not allow to pull images, instead\r\na placeholder \"$\" has been used, which allowed to remove the\r\nparameter altogether.\r\n\r\n3) We also disable \"build-images\" jobs if github repository is different\r\nthan \"apache/airflow\" so that you do not run it needlessly in your\r\nprivate PR.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

appears to be missing a license which can cause trouble (see https://github.com/jdunck/python-unicodecsv/issues/80)\r\n\r\nAnd it appears that this library may no longer be required\r\n\r\nI have not tested this with any of the actual services... just coding it up based on how it's supposed to work AFAICT\r\n\r\nBasically, previously you needed to open the file in mode `wb` and then you set the encoding on the writer object.  Then the writer object would accept strings and encode them before passing to the file handler.\r\n\r\nAnd now, you open the file in text mode (optionally you can set an encoding) and then you still pass it a string.\r\n\r\nThere were some cases (sql to gcs) where the file handler was sometimes used directly (separte from the csv writer object) and there we previously needed to encode to utf-8 first -- that's why i removed those \"encode\" calls.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple instances where the handler previously opened in `w` mode and i'm not sure how that actually worked because it doesn't seem to work for me.  Possible those cases were actually broken?  (mssql-to-hive, vertica-to-hive, vertica-to-mysql)  Also possible i am just missing something on that

JiraOperator fails when using methods that returns any other thing than a dict. This PR fix it by checking whenever a dict is returned.\r\n\r\n### Example issue\r\nThe [`get_project_issues_count` method](https://github.com/atlassian-api/atlassian-python-api/blob/master/atlassian/jira.py#L2650) returns the number of issues in a project, as `int`.\r\n```python\r\nJiraOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"example\",\r\n\tjira_method=\"get_project_issues_count\",\r\n\tjira_conn_id=\"jira\",\r\n\tjira_method_args={\"project\": \"ABC\"},\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n)\r\n```\r\nHowever, the [current implementation of the JiraOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/atlassian/jira/operators/jira.py#L79) expect a dict as response, to perform a `get` on it.\r\nThus, the above code will fail, throwing the following:\r\n```logs\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/providers/atlassian/jira/operators/jira.py\", line 79, in execute\r\n    output = jira_result.get(\"id\", None) if jira_result is not None else None\r\nAttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'get'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nCheck if it's a dict prior to performing a `get` on the returned value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental

[#31668](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/31668)\r\n\r\n### What do you see as an issue?\r\n\r\nI found a small bug in the DAG Core Concepts documentation regarding the `@daily`schedule:\r\nhttps://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html#running-dags\r\n\r\nDAGs do not require a schedule, but it’s very common to define one. You define it via the `schedule` argument, like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\"my_daily_dag\", schedule=\"@daily\"):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `schedule` argument takes any value that is a valid [Crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) schedule value, so you could also do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\"my_daily_dag\", schedule=\"0 * * * *\"):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, the daily crontab notation should be `0 0 * * *` instead of `0 * * * *`, otherwise the DAG would run every hour.\r\n\r\nThe second `0`of course needs to be replaced with the hour, at which the DAG should run daily.\r\n\r\n### Solving the problem\r\n\r\nI would change the documentation at the marked location:\r\n\r\nThe `schedule` argument takes any value that is a valid [Crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) schedule value, so for a daily run at 00:00, you could also do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\"my_daily_dag\", schedule=\"0 0 * * *\"):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

support to get logs from all the containers in a pod and publish them in the airflow logging instead of always getting the base container logs. \r\nA new option `container_logging` has been added which works in conjunction with `get_logs` option. ie. if `get_logs` isn't set, `container_logging` will not be checked.\r\n\r\nThe flag takes the following values:\r\n```\r\nlist[str]: A list of container names\r\nstr: One single container name\r\nLiteral[True]: Log everything\r\nand make the argument default to BASE_CONTAINER_NAME.\r\n```\r\nThis was a community suggestion here:

anonymous AWS access. this allows the consumer of any AWS operator to use the equivalent of `aws s3 cp <s3 path> . --no-sign-request`, to write a DAG that eg reads from a public S3 bucket without providing any credentials. to leverage this, an AWS connection can be created as such:\r\n```\r\nconn = Connection(\r\n    conn_id=\"aws_demo\",\r\n    conn_type=\"aws\",\r\n    extra={\r\n        \"config_kwargs\": {\r\n            \"signature_version\": \"unsigned\",\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is necessary because botocore's `UNSIGNED` is not JSON-serializable, so using `botocore.UNSIGNED` when instantiating the connection will cause the connection processing to fail. instead we can use a string in the connection instantiation and convert it to botocore's expected value later. more history about this issue here: https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/2442\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

move the logic to a method for easier testing.  This is a lemma on the way to actually fixing the logic.~\r\n\r\nOK so morphed this PR to actually fix the behavior. \r\n\r\nPreviously there were a couple issues with the logic.\r\n\r\nIf a teardown was ignorable (the default) then extraneous tasks that were not \"natural\" leaves would be included as leaves.  E.g. in this scenario\r\n```\r\ns1 >> w1 >> t1\r\ns1 >> t1\r\n```\r\nboth `s1` and `w1` would be included as the effective leaves.  that's because it looked at the upstreams of t1 when t1 was ignorable, without considering whether those upstreams still were properly leaves.\r\n\r\nthe other issue was that if a teardown was set with on_failure_fail_dagrun, then it would be considered a leaf *no matter where it occurred in the dag*.  in order to be considered for dag run state, a teardown still needs to be properly a leaf.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-01T01:01:40Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T03:16:18Z","closed_at":"2023-06-02T05:46:01Z","merged_at":"2023-06-02T05:46:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d43826b5ddd40eafca738d6b640cddfdad94cfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes
