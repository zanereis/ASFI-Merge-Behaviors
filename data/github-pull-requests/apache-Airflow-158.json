PR may be too large.\r\n\r\n~~Details to come later. Submitted for CI at the moment.~~\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion with @ashb, this simplfies the operator mapping API to implement only what’s described in [AIP-42](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-42+Dynamic+Task+Mapping)). Specifically, only the following syntax variants are implemented:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Classic operator syntax. The .partial call is required.\r\nMyOperator.partial(task_id=\"my_task\", ...).map(option=mapped_value, ...)\r\n\r\n# Taskflow syntax.\r\n@task\r\ndef my_func(a, b):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nmy_func.partial(a=mapped_value).map(b=another_value)\r\nmy_func.map(a=mapped_value, b=another_value)  # .partial is optional.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis greatly simplifies the implementation, and resolves an existing issue that a mapped operator is added multiple times to the DAG (once when the non-mapped operator is instantiated, and once when .map() is called).\r\n\r\nThe implementation, from a high level, is like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass BaseOperator(AbstractOperator):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def partial(cls, **kwargs):\r\n        OperatorPartial(kwargs)\r\n\r\nclass OperatorPartial:  # This is *not* added to the DAG.\r\n    def map(self, **kwargs):\r\n        return MappedOperator(self.kwargs, kwargs)\r\n\r\nclass MappedOperator(AbstractOperator):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI needed to change and review a lot of implementation for the above redesign, and had much difficulty following the current code structure. So to achieve the above, I also refactored the code base a bit to\r\n\r\n1. Rename `airflow.models.base.Operator` to `AbstractOperator` (to make it clearer it holds the basic implementation of both `BaseOperator` and `MappedOperator`). The class is moved to `airflow.models.abstractoperator` to clean up module dependencies. Currently (in main), `airflow.models.base` very strangely _depends on_ `airflow.models.taskmixin`.\r\n2. Move `MappedOperator` out of `airflow.models.baseoperator`, to a new module `airflow.models.mappedoperator`. The `baseoperator` module was already over 1000 lines long before AIP-42, and `MappedOperator` (and its relatives) grew a lot in this PR that IMO warrants a new module (~500 lines).\r\n3. Refactor `.partial()` to correctly coerce arguments using the same (either copied or reused) logic as `BaseOperator.__init__()`, e.g. `retry_timeout`, `params`, `start_date`, `end_date`.\r\n4. For easier type annotation, add a `Operator = Union[BaseOperator, MappedOperator]`. This is put in a new module `airflow.models.operator` because I can’t figure out a better place.\r\n5. Annotate `DAG.add_task()` to take `MappedOperator`. Because it should. This cascades to a ton of typing changes that helped catch many subtle issues in the implementation and is well worth the effort.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe type annotation changes are not finished. I stopped at the boundary of `TaskInstance` since it is clear the class needs a ton more work. For a mapped task, `TaskInstance.task` is initially a `MappedOperator`, but when the task instance gets unmapped, it will become `BaseOperator`. This means that in _some_ functions we can expect `TaskInstance.task` to be a concrete `BaseOperator`, not just an abstract operator. But tracing the call stack is a big undertaking that should be done

resolves the bucket_name and key in the poke method.\r\n\r\nPulling this \"resolution\" logic out into a `_resolve_bucket_and_key` method makes it a little clearer what's happening there.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't just do it in `__init__` because we have to wait for templates to render first.\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity here to remove redundant s3 uri parsing logic, which already exists in a static method on the hook.\r\n\r\nAnd since we use that hook method now, I had to update the tests to not mock the entire hook class but only the check methods.\r\n\r\nFinally, since while I was at it I strengthened the test slightly, replacing `assert op.poke(None)` with `assert op.poke(None) is True` etc, since mocks can evaluate to

the recently added LogTemplate mechanism old TIs will still use the format they had at creation time (with the change here to ensure that we create a LogTemplate row for the just-upgraded-in-place) so the logs can still be viewed in the UI.\r\n\r\nUnfortuantely the only way I can find to have map_index only appear for mapped tasks, but also to retain full control of the filename to users was to put a conditional in the template, which I am not happy about.\r\n\r\nAnd since it was now getting quite \"deep\" I have chosen to \"label\" the components in the \"hive partition style\".\r\n\r\n~I'll need to test this change with Elasticsearch too~ ES working now.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is a bug when an empty list is passed into S3DeleteObjectsOperator from another task it will try and deleted all keys on the bucket. While the intent of passing in an empty prefix might be to delete all keys, the intent of passing in a empty keys list would be to delete no keys.\r\n\r\nThis is because I assume templating does something with __init__ so the check for this condition is not run.\r\n\r\nThe case is:\r\nIn line 379 because keys is an empty list it is false so keys is now assigned the return values from list_keys which when passed no prefix will return all keys.\r\n\r\nThe change is to move the xor check of keys or prefix is inside the execute function to ensure it is checked at run time\r\n

fix from #21175 did not actually fix the logging behaviour\r\nwith non-ascii characters returned by docker logs when xcom\r\npush was enabled. The problem is that DockerOperator uses\r\ndifferent methods to stream the logs as they come (using attach\r\nstream) and different method to retrieve the logs to actually\r\nreturn the Xcom value. The latter uses \"logs\" method of docker\r\nclient. The tests have not caught it, because the two methods\r\nwere mocked in two different places.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses the same \"stringify()\" function to convert both\r\n\"logged\" logs and those that are pushed as xcom.\r\n\r\nFixes: #19027\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#21237 #21348\r\n\r\nNew SQL lexers were added as part of #21237, however, these new lexers won't be available for use as `template_fields_renderers` in operators until Airflow 2.3. This PR adds a check for the availability of the new SQL lexers (`mysql`, `postgresql`, and `tsql`) to be used as `template_field_renderers`. If they are not available, the renderer will fallback to `sql`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/21397\r\n\r\nBy moving this logic into the `DagFileProcessorManager` and running it across all processed file periodically, we can prevent the use of un-indexed queries. \r\n\r\nThe basic logic is that we can look at the last processed time of a file (for a given processor) and compare that to the `last_parsed_time` of an entry in the `dag` table. If the file has been processed significantly more recently than the DAG has been updated, then its safe to assume that the DAG is missing and can be marked inactive.\r\n\r\n### Todo:\r\n\r\n- [x] Improve test coverage\r\n- [x] Exposed new tuneable parameters in the

now when using GCSToGCSOperator to copy a file from one bucket to another, if the source file does not exist, nothing happens and the task is considered successful. This could be good for some use cases, for example, when you want to copy all the files from a directory or that match a specific pattern.\r\nBut for some other cases, like when you only want to copy one specific blob, it might be useful to raise an exception if the source file can't be found. Otherwise, the task would be failing silently.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the flag \"source_object_required\" to GCSToGCSOperator to enable this feature. By default, for backward compatibility, the value set to False. If we pass set the flag as True, then, if the source_objects are blobs (not folders or patterns) and they don't exist, the task will fail.\r\n\r\ncloses:

story behind this change:**\r\nThis change is somehow inspired by the [AIP-47](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-47+New+design+of+Airflow+System+Tests) that is still in the *discussion* phase. In this new design of system tests, we need to make use of [Trigger Rules](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/dags.html#trigger-rules) for handling `teardown` tasks (e.g. for cleaning resources required by recently executed the system test). The main concern is that when we use `teardown` task with trigger rule `all_done` (to make sure that it is executed even if something's gone wrong in the middle of the test), the whole test (which is just a DAG) will take the result from this particular `teardown` task and we can lose the information about some failing task in the middle. This is not expected workflow for the tests, because we want the test to fail if any step (task) failed. The reason why the whole test gets the status of a `teardown` task and not signalizes that anything failed in the middle is that Airflow works like this - the DAG Run status is determined by the status of the \"leaf nodes\" (the tasks that do not have any children). Since the `teardown` task is the leaf node, the whole test gets the same status (which is almost always `success`). \r\nThat's why we need to have another `watcher` task with trigger rule set to `one_failed` that is a downstream task for any other task in the test (DAG). Thanks to this, it will be triggered if any of the task in the DAG failed and thus its status will be propagated to the DAG Run (because it is a leaf node).\r\n\r\nBy doing the research in the documentation and code, I found it very difficult to find the information how trigger rules work in the details and that's why I thought that it would be good to extend the documentation for them. Since I already spent some time to understand it deeply, I also took the effort and prepared this PR. It's not big, but it took me several hours to prepare these statements. I am not sure if all the statements are correct, so please read it carefully and correct me if I'm wrong and I will edit the PR. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would like to also start a discussion about the trigger rules. To me they seemed simple at first, but the more time I spent with them I figured out that they introduce a lot of complications to the task execution. I hope that this PR will make it easier to understand how they work.

PR adds new operators to Databricks provider:\r\n* `DatabrickSqlOperator` that allows to execute SQL commands against Databricks SQL Endpoints and Databricks clusters.\r\n* `DatabricksCopyIntoOperator` (built on top of `DatabrickSqlOperator`) that allows to import data into Databricks tables.\r\n\r\nThis operator uses the same connection as other Databricks operators (although it could be discussed), if having a dedicated connection make sense as we can further customize it with specific input fields, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother possible improvement - make the `databricks-sql-connector` dependency optional, but I'm not sure how to make it correctly in Airflow\r\n\r\ncloses: #21030 \r\ncloses:

pull request is to fix an inconsistency and bug found during testing in #21348. This is an additional fix to the issue solved in #19787.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in accordance with https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/21348#issuecomment-1030723900\r\nIn the `AWSGlueJobOperator` (file path: `airflow/providers/amazon/aws/operators/glue.py`), I have changed the default value of `num_of_dpus` from `6` to `None`. \r\n\r\nWithout this fix, it becomes inconsistent with the logic changed in the [airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/glue.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/19787/files#diff-039a9f654ab15c81177e8747d7dd210768a6c3dcb5404be66f4e3c3a7b732c6a). In the `AWSGlueJobOperator` script, if the user does not want to specify the `num_of_dpus`, then also the `__init__` function is default initializing it to `6` (which gives the error below). Currently, to get around it, the user has to specify `num_of_dpus=None` to run without error. This fix solves this issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile \"/Users/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/models/taskinstance.py\", line 1511, in _execute_task result =

existing celery subclass check in celery cli validation with a new attribute to Celery based executors.\r\nAlso moved celery module check a level higher. IMO, it is worth checking even if the user is using built-in Celery or C-K executors.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind this change is to allow any custom executor to utilize built-in airflow celery executor/worker. There are some cases that doesn't make sense to subclass the existing Celery / C-K executors (for example a similar implementation of C-K executor that has some other executors for routing, but not Kubernetes\").\r\n\r\nThis change should be backward compatible, assuming subclasses of C/C-K in the wild does not have `supports_celery` attribute defined for other use.","created_at":"2022-02-06T00:17:37Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T19:37:39Z","closed_at":"2022-04-30T19:37:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f3dd99db014f378f9de4c0c18a4b4b7bd0c9e3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repo

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8937\r\n\r\nThis pull request changes `ZendeskHook` to use `zenpy` package instead of `zdesk`.\r\n\r\nI tried to introduce as little breaking changes as possible. We keep the ability to make 'custom' get request via the `call` method.\r\n \r\nStarting from here we can then add specific methods for each resource using dedicated zenpy APIs. (accessible trough zenpy's client e.g: users, tickets, organizations etc.). But I think this goes beyond the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\n> Note: Zenpy is now taking care of the rate limiting for
