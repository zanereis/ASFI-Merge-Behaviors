Description of PR\r\n\r\nHTTP Status Codes are helpful while responding back to the successful requests but they become little less meaningful when something actual failed internally such as Processor/DataFlow errored and message needs to be communicated back to client to make little more meaningful.

ReplaceText -> HandleHTTPResponse`\r\n\r\nThis sequence becomes little overloaded when failures need to be handled at different step such as processor exception/custom message etc.\r\n\r\nIntroducing new optional property 'HTTP Status Message' which can remove the need to use ReplaceText can be a lot beneficial where dataflow users can directly write the message or use EL from Parameter/Variable Registry to denote canonical messages based on status code which can used across all HandleHTTPResponse directly.\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8614 Updates `NodeClusterCoordinatorFactoryBean` to support a `null` instance of `ClusterNodeFirewall` as expected prior to upgrading from Spring Framework 4 to Spring Framework 5.  Changes include adjusting `FileBasedClusterNodeFirewallFactoryBean` to return `null` when the firewall configuration file is not found.  These changes are necessary to support existing system integration tests and clusters running without TLS configured.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`nifi-standard-processors` and `nifi-lookup-services`, supporting HTTP Digest authentication for `InvokeHTTP` and `RestLookupService`.  Version 2.5 changes the library group identifier as part of a migration from hosting in JCenter to Maven Central.  Version 2.0 and above provide compatibility with OkHttp 4, which is currently used in both `InvokeHTTP` and `RestLookupService`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-25T01:31:32Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T16:41:41Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T16:41:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35b44da2200f969065b92252971de2b12e510d5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5096/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5096/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/4af427d11f62dcefc7391d87dcf0ff9c9bdb3d1f","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-8626","ref":"NIFI-8626","sha":"4af427d11f62dcefc7391d87dcf0ff9c9bdb3d1f","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

This facilitates easier configuration during flow creation especially with multi-tenancy in mind. There are 3 properties added: default flowfile expiration, default back pressure object threshold, default back pressure data size threshold. \r\n\r\nSee updated User Guide for additional information.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior includes a basic unit test. It was also tested extensively in a running NiFi as some features are heavily UI-dependent. \r\nVerified the new elements of the Process Group (PG) DTO are populated into flow.xml.gz when NiFi is started using an older format, i.e. without the new elements included\r\nVerified the values of the added elements are “0 sec” for FlowFile Expiration, and obtained from nifi.properties for back pressure settings\r\nVerified PG settings are displayed as non-editable when user is not in the ‘modify the component’ policy.\r\nVerified PG settings are displayed as “Unauthorized” when user is not in the ‘view the component’ policy.\r\nVerified new connection defaults change as the PG settings change\r\nVerified the settings of existing connections do not change as the PG settings change\r\nVerified newly created PG inherits strings from parent\r\nVerified settings of existing child PG do not change as parent PG settings change\r\nVerified User Guide documentation updated and displays correctly\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

New property \"nifi.web.context.root\" is added to nifi.properties and must be set to be the web context root, e.g, /node1, that all NiFi webapps should be deployed under for each node. Then, each context path of the different NiFi webapps on different nodes should have a separate `<Location>` entry in proxy.conf of Apache's mod_proxy.  Please see Administration Guide for further details.\r\nAlso, add validation of flow.xml.gz to make sure it's a valid XML when writing to and reading from disk.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message? \r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

New property \"nifi.web.context.root\" is added to nifi.properties and must be set to be the web context root, e.g, /node1, that all NiFi webapps should be deployed under for each node. Then, each context path of the different NiFi webapps on different nodes should have a separate `<Location>` entry in proxy.conf of Apache's mod_proxy.  Please see Administration Guide for further details.\r\nAlso, add validation of flow.xml.gz to make sure it's a valid XML when writing to and reading from disk.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ No] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8614 Updates the `FileBasedClusterNodeFirewallFactoryBean` to return an internal `PermitAllClusterNodeFirewall` implementation instead of `null` when the Cluster Node Firewall configuration file is not provided.  Spring Framework 4 allowed `ApplicationContext.getBean()` to return null, but Spring Framework 5 returns `NullBean` instead, which breaks the expected class in `NodeClusterCoordinatorFactoryBean`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

run for testing performance before/after changes to AvroTypeUtil. Updated AvroTypeUtil to be more efficient by not using Record.getValue() and instead iterating over the Map of values directly. getValue() is less efficient here because we know the RecordField's we are iterating over exist in the schema since they are retrieved from there directly; as a result, any null values still have be looked up by aliaases, but that step can be skipped in this situation. Also avoided looking for fields that exist in Avro Schema and not in RecordSchema just to set default values on GenericRecord - there's no need to set them if they are default values.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n  contributor license agreements.

Therefore the easiest way to test out the functionality is through the CLI:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#> nifi set-inherited-param-contexts -pcid <param context id> -pcii <comma-separated list of param context ids>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8516 Implements the stated goals of NIFI-8220 providing a basic layer of security for the default installation of NiFi.\r\n\r\nThe default configuration disables HTTP on port 8080 and enables HTTPS on port 9443 using a self-signed certificate generated during the bootstrap process.  The default configuration also leverages the Single User Login Identity Provider and Authorizer to generate a random username and password for authentication.  The NiFi README.md includes updated instructions and screenshots describing how to access NiFi using the generated credentials.\r\n\r\nThese changes will not impact existing installations of NiFi following an upgrade.  Neither the self-signed certificate nor the generated username and password are intended for production deployments.  The purpose of these default configuration changes is to provide a greater level of security for default installations of NiFi while maintain a straightforward experience for new users.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8367 Removes joda-time direct dependency from `nifi-standard-processors`.  Recent changes to `InvokeHTTP` removed the last direct reference to Joda Time.  The `nifi-standard-content-viewer` module still relies on Joda Time for handling certain Avro fields and will remain necessary until the Avro dependency is upgraded.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8502 Upgrades Spring Framework and Spring Security dependencies across framework and extension components from version 4 to version 5.  Spring Framework 4 is no longer supported as of December 2020.\r\n\r\nSpring Security version 4, as well as 5.4.3 and below, are vulnerable to [CVE-2021-22112](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22112).  Although NiFi does not use HttpSession and does not perform multiple modifications to the Spring Security Context, Spring Security should be upgraded to the current version.\r\n\r\nUpgrading to Spring Framework 5 required a small refactor to the framework `ApplicationStartupContextListener` to avoid calling `ApplicationContext.getBean()` for objects that can be null when running in a standalone configuration.  Spring Framework 5 does not return `null` for `getBean()` and instead returns a `NullBean`, which did not meet the expectations of the listener.  Refactoring the `ThreadPoolRequestReplicatorFactoryBean` to implement `DisposableBean` allowed the Factory Bean to handle its own lifecycle, and removing the expected class parameter for `loginIdentityProvider` and `authorizer` also avoided unnecessary exceptions.\r\n\r\nOther framework and extension updates include the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Spring Framework references from version 4.3.30 to 5.3.6\r\n- Upgraded Spring Security from version 4.2.20 to 5.4.6\r\n- Upgraded Spring Data Redis from 2.1.16 to 2.5.0\r\n- Upgraded Jedis from 2.9.0 to 3.6.0 to match Spring Data Redis 2.5.0\r\n- Upgraded Easy Rules from 3.4.0 to 4.1.0 to support Spring 5\r\n- Upgraded Hortonworks Schema Registry Client from 0.8.1 to 0.9.1 to support Spring 5\r\n- Included spring-security-crypto dependency with references to spring-security-kerberos-core to maintain capability with Spring Security 5\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe maven archetype for creating a new processor and service essentially only work for standalone projects.\r\nThis is caused by the generated code to have the apache pom as the parent and all generated files have a license header that indicates ownership by the ASF (which in general is not true).\r\nThis makes creating a Nifi processor as a separate module in an existing project is needlessly hard.\r\n\r\nThis pull request tries to fix that.\r\n\r\nThe changes:\r\n- I found the existing files to be uncleanly formatted so I added a .editorconfig file to aid in making them consistently formatted.\r\n- I removed all the ASF license headers from the files that are generated.\r\n- I added a basic \"BOM\" for projects to depend on. This is a basic version that will probably need additional attention. I'm not quite sure which dependencies should be mentioned in there.\r\n- The generated projects no longer have Nifi as their parent project but now import the versions as a dependencyManagement.\r\n\r\nI have kept these changes in separate commits in case you choose to reject for example the .editorconfig addition.\r\n\r\n_Fixes NIFI-8526._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

I considered moving OSUtils to nifi-utils but didn't want to increase the footprint 1+ MB (due to JNA dependencies) in all places that use nifi-utils. If we ever move nifi-utils to lib in NiFi we should do the same to MiNiFi and use the same OSUtils.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8246 Sets `NIFI_PBKDF2_AES_GCM_256` as the Sensitive Properties Key Algorithm in the default `nifi.properties` configuration.  This replaces the previous default of `PBEWITHMD5AND256BITAES-CBC-OPENSSL` which uses a deprecated cipher provider and weak key generation strategy using MD5 with 1000 iterations.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms supported in NIFI-7668 require a minimum password length of 12 characters.  This will work by default with the introduction of NIFI-8230, which provides random sensitive key generation is absence of an existing property.\r\n\r\nThe PBKDF2 algorithm is not the most advanced key derivation function available, but it meets FIPS-140-2 compliance standards, and the current implementation defaults to 160,000 iterations with SHA-512.  Administrators retain the ability to configure other options, and the previous default value remains as a supported option for users upgrading from previous versions.  This new default configuration setting provides much greater protection of encrypted sensitive properties as a result of using PBKDF2 as well as AES-GCM in place of MD5 and AES-CBC.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8462 Refactors the `PutSyslog` and `ListenSyslog` Processors to use Netty for socket communication.  This approach replaces the use of custom socket channel dispatcher classes in `nifi-processor-utils`.  Leveraging the Netty `SslHandler` also removes the use of custom `SSLSocket` and `SSLEngine` handling in `nifi-security-socket-ssl` classes.  This approach resolves latent issues with TLS 1.3 communication in these processors, described in NIFI-7468.\r\n\r\nThe new `nifi-event-transport` module abstracts communication handling for both UDP and TCP communication, providing interfaces and classes that can be leveraged in other components.  Refactoring other components to leverage Netty should eventually remove the need for error-prone `SSLEngine` handling in custom classes.\r\n\r\nChanges also include refactored unit tests for `PutSyslog` and `ListenSyslog`, eliminating the use of mocked senders and removing unnecessary integration tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-30T15:14:39Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T14:55:51Z","closed_at":"2021-05-25T14:55:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b400bec43d548a4555aafbc3c30fbcced62646b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5044/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5044/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5044/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/cbc574880f1d798f942dbc1a646cf6d5eb15d550","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-8462","ref":"NIFI-8462","sha":"cbc574880f1d798f942dbc1a646cf6d5eb15d550","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

This service can be used to implement encryption in the Encrypt Tool using Vault, and decryption in a new Sensitive Properties Provider (both of which are follow-on goals of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8444).\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

If the offloaded node reconnected, its queue would list the second node first, but all other nodes (including the second node) would still have the first node listed first.  Therefore, an infinite loop resulted where the first node would be balancing its flowfiles to the second node, and the second node would balance all of its flowfiles to the first node.  The result was that this particular queue would ignore backpressure and the following processor would never be reached, at the same time.\r\n\r\nAll that said, this fix does the following to resolve the issue:\r\n* Causes all non-offloading nodes to remove the offloading node from their partitionQueues in SocketLoadBalancedFlowFileQueue, whenever the OFFLOADING node state change is detected.  This allows all other nodes to be in sync with the first node's partitionQueue.\r\n* Causes all non-offloading nodes (of which the previously offloaded node will now be one) to add back a node to the partition queue upon CONNECTED node state change.  This allows the offloaded node to regain its place as the \"first node\" in Single Node load balancing.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

The code erroneously used the record field index which may not map to the same column index in the table. This change does a name lookup to get the column corresponding to the record at the field index, and uses that to determine data type.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nAs of KUDU-1884, Kudu supports custom Kerberos principals on server-side\r\nand custom SASL protocol (service) names on client-side which must match\r\nthe SPN base, i.e. if the SPN is kudu/_HOST, SASL protocol name *must*\r\nbe \"kudu\" in the client to be able to connect to the cluster.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the ability to configure this in the PutKudu

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8435 Adds the `Kudu Client Worker Count` property to `PutKudu` with a default value that matches the value used in `KuduClient`.  The property sets both the worker count property for `KuduClient` as well the maximum pool size for the `ThreadPoolExecutor` that `KuduClient` uses to configure the internal Netty `NioEventLoopGroup`.  This maximum pool size ensures that the thread pool cannot continue to grow unbounded in certain edge case scenarios.  The custom `ThreadFactory` also names client threads using the Processor Identifier to assist with runtime troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nUpdates also include refactoring processing methods to ensure that the `KuduSession` is always closed after each `onTrigger` invocation.  Under the previous implementation, the Processor called `KuduSession.close()` when remaining buffered records were found.  `PutKudu` is also annotated with `SystemResource.MEMORY` to indicate that multiple instances increase memory usage based on pooled byte buffering present in Netty version 4.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8451 Corrects `KeyStoreUtils` and related unit tests usage of `java.security.KeyStore.getInstance()` to ensure that a Security Provider is always specified.  Java 8 Update 292 uncovered an issue with `KeyStoreUtils.loadEmptyKeyStore()` and a unit test method where the Security Provider was not supplied when instantiating a PKCS12 KeyStore.  This resulted in test failures when attempting to store and load PrivateKey entries between the BouncyCastle PKCS12 KeyStore implementation and the JDK PKCS12 implementation.  Updates include refactoring KeyStoreUtils unit tests into a single test class, removing ignored test methods, and iterating over all KeystoreType values in place of separate test methods.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Much more testing must be done before creating a full Pull Request, and there are a couple of corner cases that still will be problematic (such as MergeContent/MergeRecord with a Correlation Attribute set). Perhaps will have to introduce something into the Processor API that will indicate whether or not the Processor can be used in a given runtime engine (NIFI, MINIFI, STATELESS) with a given configuration, etc.\r\n\r\nBut making available for review/testing by others who may be interested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
