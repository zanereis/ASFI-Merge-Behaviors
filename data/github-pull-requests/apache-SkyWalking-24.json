Non-atomic operations on volatile fields are operations where the field is read and the value is used to update the field. It is possible for the value of the field to change between the read and the write, possibly invalidating the operation. The non-atomic operation can be avoided by surrounding it with a synchronized block or by making use of one of the classes from the java.util.concurrent.atomic

Due to some special database drivers(eg. ojdbc), different classes have same method name. For example , all of T4CPreparedStatement, OraclePreparedStatementWrapper and OraclePreparedStatement have setString method. If we create a InterceptPoint for setString, all of these 3 classes can be intercepted, but only OraclePreparedStatementWrapper(Outside invocation) have connection info and StatementEnhanceInfo. Hence, sometimes when ojdbc invoke executeQuery method with setMethod for SQL parameters, setMethod of OraclePreparedStatementWrapper runs well , but both  T4CPreparedStatement and OraclePreparedStatement  would get a NullPoniterException. We can find it in agent log. To aviod this issue in a easy way , we can try to add a null-conditional operator for statementEnhanceInfos, to prevent the null object invoke setParameter(index, parameter); \r\n- [ ] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works.\r\n- [x] Explain briefly about why the bug exists and how to fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🔌 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new plugin, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### Add an agent plugin to support <framework name>\r\n- [ ] Add a test case for the new plugin, refer to [the doc](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/guides/Plugin-test.md)\r\n- [ ] Add a component id in [the component-libraries.yml](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/oap-server/server-bootstrap/src/main/resources/component-libraries.yml)\r\n- [ ] Add a logo in [the UI repo](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui/tree/master/src/views/components/topology/assets)\r\n     ==== 🔌 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new plugin, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 📈 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're improving the performance, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### Improve the performance of <class or module or ...>\r\n- [ ] Add a benchmark for the improvement, refer to [the existing ones](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/apm-commons/apm-datacarrier/src/test/java/org/apache/skywalking/apm/commons/datacarrier/LinkedArrayBenchmark.java)\r\n- [ ] The benchmark result.\r\n```text\r\n<Paste the benchmark results here>\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Links/URLs to the theory proof or discussion articles/blogs. <links/URLs here>\r\n     ==== 📈 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're improving the performance, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### <Feature description>\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [ ] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [ ] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [ ] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n     ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.

clusters. This is realy helpful when handling large-scaled services/Multiple Data Centers/Edge Computing. \r\nWhen skywalking cluster deployed in a Data Center(\"DC1\" for example) and the topics mirrored from other Data Centers will be renamed based on the aliases(\"DC2.skywalking-metrics etc.\"):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/tree/trunk/connect/mirror#remote-topics\r\n\r\nAdding support to oap kafka module for the renamed topics, set the aliases via application.yml or environment variables. This feature need to set up an oap server for each mirrored Kafka cluster.","created_at":"2020-12-04T06:29:04Z","updated_at":"2020-12-06T09:10:31Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T09:10:31Z","merged_at":"2020-12-06T09:10:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"6eb5648ba8928a73d5ca22ef7d36b40d08d86c8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP

Add an agent plugin to support Spring-Kafka 1.3.x\r\n- [x] Add a test case for the new plugin\r\n- [x] Add a component id in the [component-libraries.yml](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/oap-server/server-bootstrap/src/main/resources/component-libraries.yml). Shared with `kafka`.\r\n- [x] Add a logo in [the UI repo](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui/tree/master/src/views/components/topology/assets). Shared with `kafka`.\r\n\r\n- [x] As a continuation of #5244\r\n- [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md)\r\n\r\n### The current design of Spring-Kafka plugin\r\n\r\nThe current `Spring-Kafka` plugin in skywalking is aimed at `Spring-Kafka 2.x+` in the sense that there is a `pollAndInvoke` method which is responsible for `poll` messages from Kafka and `invoke` the listeners defined by developers. And this method is provided from version 2.2.1 in order to improve the smell of the codes https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-kafka/pull/873\r\n\r\nSo the current plugin takes advantage of this refactor and enhances directly this `pollAndInvoke` method. But we still have to maintain many services which depend on Spring-Boot 1.5.x and thus `Spring-Kafka` 1.3.x according to [the official compatibility matrix](https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka).\r\n\r\n### The approach to versions below 2.2.x\r\n\r\nBelow that specific version, we do not have `pollAndInvoke` method and this whole function is **inlined** into the `while`-loop of the main `run` method, thus seems not possible to make this enhancement. My approach is to enhance the `processSeeks` in the same inner class `ListenerConsumer`. The reason why we choose this aspect is,\r\n\r\n- this method is called at the very beginning of the loop (or equivalently the end of the loop), then we can inject(remove) our `Context` after(before) the method is executed.\r\n- this method is called and **only** called there, it is not used in other places, which represents precisely the beginning of the run loop.\r\n\r\nFor completeness and safe reasons, we also enhance the whole `run()` method in order to remove the context after the loop finishes.\r\n\r\nThe last thing is to distinguish the versions of `Spring-Kafka`. I use `org.springframework.kafka.listener.config.ContainerProperties` as the witness class for versions below `2.2.x`. This class is renamed as `org.springframework.kafka.listener.ContainerProperties` after `2.2.x`. So this plugin will not be applied for Spring-Kafka 2.2.x+. I have checked all versions up to `2.6.x`.\r\n\r\nSo with this plugin, we can enhance the following `Spring-Kafka` versions, which are missing so far,\r\n\r\n- 1.3.x\r\n- 2.0.x\r\n- 2.1.x\r\n\r\nTheoretically, it can also work with 1.2.x, but that version is not recommended by the official Spring-Kafka team. Also with `Spring-Kafka` 1.2.x, you have to manually set Kafka version to those higher than `0.10`.

So, I expose the metrics metadata list query service by the GraphQL to adopt the HPA requirement.\r\n\r\nIn this query\r\n1. You could query all metrics when put `regex=`.\r\n1. Use any regex to filter all available metrics by name.\r\n\r\nIn the response, we provide the name, type, catalog of all metrics. Here is the response for my local test\r\n```graphql\r\n{\r\n  listMetrics(regex: \"service.*\") {\r\n  \tname,\r\n    type,\r\n    catalog\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n{\r\n  \"data\":

Adjust #5835 to adopt this as the lastest naming rule. \r\n1. Update UI's template page. `Service Filter` should be renamed to `Service Group`(including the Chinese version)\r\n1. Update the self-observability dashboard configuration(maybe codes too).\r\n\r\n# Service Auto Grouping\r\nSkyWalking supports various default and customized dashboard templates. \r\nEach template provides the reasonable layout for the services in the particular field. \r\nSuch as, services with a language agent installed \r\ncould have different metrics with service detected by the service mesh observability solution, \r\nand different with SkyWalking's self-observability metrics dashboard.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since 8.3.0, SkyWalking OAP would generate the group based on this simple naming format.\r\n\r\n### ${service name} = [${group name}:]${logic name}\r\n\r\nOnce the service name includes `:`(colon), the literal string before the colon would be considered as the group name.\r\nIn the latest GraphQL query, the group name has been provided as an option parameter.\r\n> getAllServices(duration: Duration!, group: String): [Service!]!\r\n\r\nRocketBot UI dashboards(`Standard` type) support the `group name` for default and custom configurations.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFYI @hailin0 I think you need to consider this in your DolphinScheduler integration.

I found we need to support this in the mesh telemetry internal format to support defining metrics in the mesh case.\r\nThere are 2 major changes in the PR\r\n1. Nested classes definition is not supported in the previous OAL core, so I added them. It should support any nested class.\r\n2. Support `sideCar.internalErrorCode` in the Service, ServiceInstance, Endpoint, ServiceRelation, and ServiceInstanceRelation sources, then you could have OAL scripts like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nservice_cpm_sidecar = from(Service.*).filter(sideCar.internalErrorCode != \"\").cpm();\r\nservice_sla_sidecar = from(Service.*).percent(sideCar.internalErrorCode != \"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current Istio+Envoy mesh telemetry's `sideCar.internalErrorCode` is mapping to envoy's v2 ALS definition, https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/data/accesslog/v2/accesslog.proto#data-accesslog-v2-responseflags.\r\n\r\nAt last, I didn't change anything in the default OAL, all these two features are open to the users. If they want to this, they could add new OAL scripts, and set up the UI.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-16T09:16:56Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T01:03:53Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T01:03:49Z","merged_at":"2020-11-17T01:03:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c486a05ee3ad8947011168e0039f5b48922e4ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rainbend","id":26432832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDMyODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26432832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend","html_url":"https://github.com/rainbend","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rainbend/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"EvanLjp","id":31562192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTYyMTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31562192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp","html_url":"https://github.com/EvanLjp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":783582051,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODM1ODIwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/core%20feature","name":"core feature","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"Core and important feature.
