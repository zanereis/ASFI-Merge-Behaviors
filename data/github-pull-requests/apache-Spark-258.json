What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use `ZoneId` instead of `TimeZone` in:\r\n- the `apply` and `getFractionFormatter ` methods of the `TimestampFormatter` object,\r\n- and in implementations of the `TimestampFormatter` trait like `FractionTimestampFormatter`.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the changes is to avoid unnecessary conversion from `TimeZone` to `ZoneId` because `ZoneId` is used in `TimestampFormatter` implementations internally, and the conversion is performed via `String` which is not for free. Also taking into account that `TimeZone` instances are converted from `String` in some cases, the worse case looks like `String` -> `TimeZone` -> `String` -> `ZoneId`. The PR eliminates the unneeded conversions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by `DateExpressionsSuite`, `DateTimeUtilsSuite` and `TimestampFormatterSuite`.","created_at":"2019-03-19T07:24:31Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T15:57:21Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T12:30:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"894258976a9f574daec2cbb573a0d896c1be199b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df58cfef1b08eb3a25a8392f8ea292ec73f6e37c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:zone-id","ref":"zone-id","sha":"df58cfef1b08eb3a25a8392f8ea292ec73f6e37c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nsee also:  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24111\r\n\r\nwhile performing some tests on our existing minikube and k8s infrastructure, i noticed that the integration tests were failing. i dug in and discovered the following message buried at the end of the stacktrace:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException:

`nss` package to `resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles/spark/Dockerfile`, everything worked.\r\n\r\nthis is also impacting current builds.  see:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe reader schema is said to be evolved (or projected) when it changed after the data is written by writers.

<pgandhi@verizonmedia.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Imran Rashid <irashid@cloudera.com>\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are two deadlocks as a result of the interplay between three different threads:\r\n\r\n**task-result-getter thread**\r\n\r\n**spark-dynamic-executor-allocation thread**\r\n\r\n**dispatcher-event-loop thread(makeOffers())**\r\n\r\nThe fix ensures ordering synchronization constraint by acquiring lock on `TaskSchedulerImpl` before acquiring lock on `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` in `makeOffers()` as well as killExecutors() method. This ensures resource ordering between the threads and thus, fixes the deadlocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add instrumentation of memory usage via the Spark Dropwizard/Codahale metrics system. Memory usage metrics are available via the Executor metrics, recently implemented as detailed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23206.\r\nAdditional notes: This takes advantage of the metrics poller introduced in #23767. \r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nExecutor metrics bring have many useful insights on memory usage, in particular on the usage of storage memory and executor memory. This is useful for troubleshooting. Having the information in the metrics systems allows to add those metrics to Spark performance dashboards and study memory usage as a function of time, as in the example graph https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12962810/Example_dashboard_Spark_Memory_Metrics.PNG\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nAdds `ExecutorMetrics` source to publish executor metrics via the Dropwizard metrics system. Details of the available metrics in docs/monitoring.md\r\nAdds configuration parameter `spark.metrics.executormetrics.source.enabled`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested on YARN cluster and with an existing setup for a Spark dashboard based on InfluxDB and Grafana.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to provide a new option to specify time-to-live (TTL) for output file entries in FileStreamSink.\r\n\r\nThe metadata log greatly helps to easily achieve exactly-once but given the output path is open to arbitrary readers, there's no way to compact the metadata log, which ends up growing the metadata file as query runs for long time, especially for compacted batch.\r\n(There're some reports from end users which include their workarounds: [SPARK-24295](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24295))\r\n\r\nThis patch will filter out outdated output files in metadata while compacting batches, which helps metadata to not grow linearly, as well as filtered out files will be \"eventually\" no longer seen in reader queries which leverage File(Stream)Source.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs per https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html \r\n``Class loaders that support concurrent loading of classes are known as parallel capable class loaders and are required to register themselves at their class initialization time by invoking the ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable method. Note that the ClassLoader class is registered as parallel capable by default. However, its subclasses still need to register themselves if they are parallel capable. ``\r\n i.e we can have finer class loading locks by registering classloaders as parallel capable.  (Refer to deadlock due to macro lock @ https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26961).\r\nAll the classloaders we have are wrapper of URLClassLoader which by itself is parallel capable. \r\nBut this cannot be achieved by scala code due to static registration Refer https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/11429\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll Existing UT must

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a derived patch from #24113.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add comment about reasoning why we keep using deprecated Scala ForkJoinPool even Spark 3.0.0 supports Scala 2.12. The origin intention was disabling deprecation warning, but Scala doesn't seem to have equivalent one for `@Suppresswarnings` for Java, so ended up just adding comment to make the intention clear.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is a minor change which would be expected to work same as it was, so Jenkins test would be enough.","created_at":"2019-03-18T06:41:33Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T13:31:40Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T13:31:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25ff17c09e76204f17733f81179670363bb8e11d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f7a3afa05788e31efb142777f655313393d6473","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:MINOR-add-reasoning-comment-to-use-deprecated-scala-forkjoinpool","ref":"MINOR-add-reasoning-comment-to-use-deprecated-scala-forkjoinpool","sha":"8f7a3afa05788e31efb142777f655313393d6473","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23882 to handle binary math/string functions. For instance, see the cases below:\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import lit, ascii\r\n>>> spark.range(1).select(lit('a').alias(\"value\")).select(ascii(\"value\"))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/functions.py\", line 51, in _\r\n    jc = getattr(sc._jvm.functions, name)(col._jc if isinstance(col, Column) else col)\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/lib/py4j-0.10.8.1-src.zip/py4j/java_gateway.py\", line 1286, in __call__\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/utils.py\", line 63, in deco\r\n    return f(*a, **kw)\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/lib/py4j-0.10.8.1-src.zip/py4j/protocol.py\", line 332, in get_return_value\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JError: An error occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.sql.functions.ascii.

For instance, numbers as strings (e.g., `\"1\"`) were supported as arguments of binary math functions before. After this PR, it recognises it as column names. \r\n\r\n- I also intentionally didn't document this behaviour changes since we're going ahead for Spark 3.0 and I don't think numbers as strings make much sense in math functions. \r\n\r\n- There is another exception `when`, which takes string as literal values as below. This PR doeesn't fix this ambiguity.\r\n  ```python\r\n  >>> spark.range(1).select(when(lit(True), col(\"id\"))).show()\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n  |CASE WHEN true THEN id END|\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n  |                         0|\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  ```python\r\n  >>> spark.range(1).select(when(lit(True), \"id\")).show()\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n  |CASE WHEN true THEN id END|\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n  |                        id|\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes as below:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23882 fixed it to:\r\n\r\n- Rename `_create_function` to `_create_name_function`\r\n- Define new `_create_function` to take strings as column names.\r\n\r\nThis PR, I proposes to:\r\n\r\n- Revert `_create_name_function` name to `_create_function`.\r\n- Define new `_create_function_over_column` to take strings as column names.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSome unit tests were added for binary math / string functions.","created_at":"2019-03-18T03:45:00Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:18:57Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T23:08:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ec1055acc9221ecdb1c1961fbdd31f58ffdf6550","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24121/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24121/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24121/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ccbe51e121ad07967fafdbb8650bb0590f8eb066","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-26979","ref":"SPARK-26979","sha":"ccbe51e121ad07967fafdbb8650bb0590f8eb066","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up work for #22112's future improvment[1]: `Currently we can't rollback and rerun a shuffle map stage, and just fail.`\r\n\r\nSpark will rerun a finished shuffle write stage while meeting fetch failures, currently, the rerun shuffle map stage will only resubmit the task for missing partitions and reuse the output of other partitions. This logic is fine in most scenarios, but for indeterministic operations(like repartition), multiple shuffle write attempts may write different data, only rerun the missing partition will lead a correctness bug. So for the shuffle map stage of indeterministic operations, we need to support rolling back the shuffle map stage and re-generate the shuffle files. In this patch, we achieve this by adding the indeterministic tag in the stage, for the indeterministic stage, when the stage resubmits, we'll clear all existing map status and rerun all partitions. We also add properties in task LocalProperties to record the message for the retried indeterminate stage, so that the shuffle file which generated from retried indeterministic stage will keep attempt id in the file name, the corresponding reduce side will specify which attempt id of shuffle it wants to read.\r\n\r\nAll changes are summarized as follows:\r\n- Extend ShuffleBlockId with indeterminateAttemptId.\r\n- Add corresponding support for ShuffleBlockResolver, if the shuffle file generated from the indeterminate stage, its name will contain the indeterminateAttemptId, otherwise the file name just as before.\r\n- Add the retried indeterminate stage info in TaskContext.localProperties and use it in Shuffle Reader and Writer.\r\n- Add the determinate flag in Stage and use it in DAGScheduler and the cleaning work for the intermediate stage.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- UT: Add UT for all changing code and newly added function.\r\n- Manual Test: Also providing a manual test to verify the effect.\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nval determinateStage0 = sc.parallelize(0 until 1000 * 1000 * 100, 10)\r\nval indeterminateStage1 = determinateStage0.repartition(200)\r\nval indeterminateStage2 = indeterminateStage1.repartition(200)\r\nval indeterminateStage3 = indeterminateStage2.repartition(100)\r\nval indeterminateStage4 = indeterminateStage3.repartition(300)\r\nval fetchFailIndeterminateStage4 = indeterminateStage4.map { x =>\r\nif (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId == 190 && \r\n  TaskContext.get.stageAttemptNumber == 0) {\r\n  throw new Exception(\"pkill -f -n java\".!!)\r\n  }\r\n  x\r\n}\r\nval indeterminateStage5 = fetchFailIndeterminateStage4.repartition(200)\r\nval finalStage6 = indeterminateStage5.repartition(100).collect().distinct.length\r\n``` \r\nIt's a simple job with multi indeterminate stage, it will get a wrong answer while using old Spark version like 2.2/2.3, and will be killed after #22112.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change is a cleanup and consolidation of 3 areas related to Pandas UDFs:\r\n\r\n1) `ArrowStreamPandasSerializer` now inherits from `ArrowStreamSerializer` and uses the base class `dump_stream`, `load_stream` to create Arrow reader/writer and send Arrow record batches.  `ArrowStreamPandasSerializer` makes the conversions to/from Pandas and converts to Arrow record batch iterators. This change removed duplicated creation of Arrow readers/writers.\r\n\r\n2) `createDataFrame` with Arrow now uses `ArrowStreamPandasSerializer` instead of doing its own conversions from Pandas to Arrow and sending record batches through `ArrowStreamSerializer`.\r\n\r\n3) Grouped Map UDFs now reuse existing logic in `ArrowStreamPandasSerializer` to send Pandas DataFrame results as a `StructType` instead of separating each column from the DataFrame. This makes the code a little more consistent with the Python worker, but does require that the returned StructType column is flattened out in `FlatMapGroupsInPandasExec` in Scala.\r\n\r\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, DataFrameReader/DataFrameReader supports setting Hadoop configurations via method `.option()`. \r\nE.g, the following test case should be passed in both ORC V1 and V2\r\n```\r\n  class TestFileFilter extends PathFilter {\r\n    override def accept(path: Path): Boolean = path.getParent.getName != \"p=2\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDecimalType Literal should not be casted to Long.\r\n\r\neg. For `df.filter(\"x < 3.14\")`, assuming df (x in DecimalType) reads from a ORC table and uses the native ORC reader with predicate push down enabled, we will push down the `x < 3.14` predicate to the ORC reader via a SearchArgument.\r\n\r\nOrcFilters will construct the SearchArgument, but not handle the DecimalType correctly.\r\n\r\nThe previous impl will construct `x < 3` from `x < 3.14`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\n$ sbt\r\n> sql/testOnly *OrcFilterSuite\r\n> sql/testOnly *OrcQuerySuite -- -z

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we run YarnSchedulerBackendSuite, the class path seems to be made from the classes folder(resource-managers/yarn/target/scala-2.12/classes) instead of jar (resource-managers/yarn/target/spark-yarn_2.12-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) . ui.getHandlers is in spark-core and its loaded from spark-core.jar which is shaded and hence refers to org.spark_project.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler\r\n\r\nHere in  org.apache.spark.scheduler.cluster.YarnSchedulerBackend, as its not shaded, it expects org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler\r\nRefer discussion @ https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27122?focusedCommentId=16792318&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16792318\r\n\r\nHence as a fix, org.apache.spark.ui.WebUI must only return a wrapper class instance or references so that Jetty classes can be avoided in getters which are accessed outside spark-core\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a limited version of dynamic allocation that does not require the external shuffle service, and thus works on kubernetes (but does not support preemption). \r\n\r\nThe basic approach is to track which executors are holding shuffle files, and of those, which have shuffle files depended on by active stages. If an executor contains shuffle files depended on by an active stage, then we treat it as \"active\" (i.e., prevent the ExecutorAllocationManager from marking it as \"idle\"). If an executor contains only shuffle files that are not dependencies of active stages, then we treat those shuffle files similarly to cached data (i.e., configurable idle timeout that defaults to \"infinity\"). \r\n\r\nWe also introduce the concept of \"shuffle biased task scheduling\", a heuristic attempt to schedule tasks for maximal efficacy of dynamic allocation. We do this by attempting to minimize the number of executors that contain (active) shuffle files, by packing as many tasks as possible onto \"active\" executors first, followed by scheduling them on executors with only inactive shuffle files, and finally all remaining executors.\r\n\r\nThis is a port of a series of PRs on Palantir's spark fork: https://github.com/palantir/spark/pull/427 https://github.com/palantir/spark/pull/445 https://github.com/palantir/spark/pull/446 https://github.com/palantir/spark/pull/447\r\n\r\nPartially addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24432\r\n\r\ncc: @rynorris @mccheah @robert3005\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe added additional tests explicitly as part of the PR, and did additional manual testing on small YARN and k8s clusters (partially documented on https://github.com/palantir/spark/pull/446). Then we successfully rolled this out for a small subset of workloads in production at Palantir, running entirely on kubernetes.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently for Monitoring Spark application SQL information is not available from REST but only via UI. REST provides only applications,jobs,stages,environment. This Jira is targeted to provide a REST API so that SQL level information can be found\r\nA single SQL query can result into multiple jobs. So for end user who is using STS or spark-sql, the intended highest level of probe is the SQL which he has executed. This information can be seen from SQL tab. Attaching a sample. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22072336/54298729-5524a800-45df-11e9-8e4d-b99a8b882031.png)\r\nBut same information he cannot access using the REST API exposed by spark and he always have to rely on jobs API which may be difficult. So i intend to expose the information seen in SQL tab in UI via REST API\r\n\r\nMainly:\r\n\r\nId :  Long - execution id of the sql\r\nstatus : String - possible values COMPLETED/RUNNING/FAILED\r\ndescription : String - executed SQL string\r\nplanDescription : String - Plan representation\r\nmetrics : Seq[Metrics] - `Metrics` contain `metricName: String, metricValue: String`\r\nsubmissionTime : String - formatted `Date` time of SQL submission\r\nduration : Long - total run time in milliseconds\r\nrunningJobIds : Seq[Int] - sequence of running job ids\r\nfailedJobIds : Seq[Int] - sequence of failed job ids\r\nsuccessJobIds : Seq[Int] - sequence of success job ids\r\n\r\n\r\n* To fetch sql executions: /sql?details=boolean&offset=integer&length=integer\r\n* To fetch single execution:  /sql/{executionID}?details=boolean\r\n\r\n| parameter | type | remarks |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|\r\n| details | boolean | Optional. Set true to get plan description and metrics information, defaults to false |\r\n| offset | integer | Optional. offset to fetch the executions, defaults to 0 |\r\n| length | integer | Optional. total number of executions to be fetched, defaults to 20 |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support users query SQL information via REST API\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. It provides a new monitoring URL for SQL\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested manually\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22072336/54282168-6d85ca00-45c1-11e9-8935-7586ccf0efff.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22072336/54282191-7b3b4f80-45c1-11e9-941c-f0ec37026192.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-13T03:57:57Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T04:21:17Z","closed_at":"2020-01-14T18:06:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"567bbf69880e1dbc2855f18d11e57042c87caa07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4560df966b767336998462faae7c3d5ab90063ed","head":{"label":"ajithme:restapi","ref":"restapi","sha":"4560df966b767336998462faae7c3d5ab90063ed","user":{"login":"ajithme","id":22072336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDcyMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22072336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme","html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":124182301,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjQxODIzMDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"ajithme/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajithme","id":22072336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDcyMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22072336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme","html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme/spark","description":"Mirror

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, users meet job abortions while creating a table using the Hive serde \"STORED AS\" with invalid column names. We had better prevent this by raising **AnalysisException** with a guide to use aliases instead like Paquet data source tables.\r\nthus making compatible with error message shown while creating Parquet/ORC native table.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"set spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet=false\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE a STORED AS PARQUET AS SELECT 1 AS `COUNT(ID)`\")\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant parquet.schema.OriginalType.col1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE a STORED AS PARQUET AS SELECT 1 AS `COUNT(ID)`\")\r\n Please use alias to rename it.;eption: Attribute name \"count(ID)\" contains invalid character(s) among \" ,;{}()\\n\\t=\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested? \r\nPass the Jenkins with the newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis fixes an error when a PySpark local iterator, for both RDD and DataFrames, goes out of scope and the connection is closed before fully consuming the iterator. The error occurs on the JVM in the serving thread, when Python closes the local socket while the JVM is writing to it. This usually happens when there is enough data to fill the socket read buffer, causing the write call to block.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this fixes a problem when an error occurs in the Python worker and the collect job is cancelled with an exception. Previously, the Python driver was never notified of the error so the user could get a partial result (iteration until the error) and the application will continue. With this change, an error in the worker is sent to the Python iterator and is then raised.\r\n\r\nThe change here introduces a protocol for PySpark local iterators that work as follows:\r\n\r\n1) The local socket connection is made when the iterator is created\r\n2) When iterating, Python first sends a request for partition data as a non-zero integer\r\n3) While the JVM local iterator over partitions has next, it triggers a job to collect the next partition\r\n4) The JVM sends a nonzero response to indicate it has the next partition to send\r\n5) The next partition is sent to Python and read by the PySpark deserializer\r\n6) After sending the entire partition, an `END_OF_DATA_SECTION` is sent to Python which stops the deserializer and allows to make another request\r\n7) When the JVM gets a request from Python but has already consumed it's local iterator, it will send a zero response to Python and both will close the socket cleanly\r\n8) If an error occurs in the worker, a negative response is sent to Python followed by the error message. Python will then raise a RuntimeError with the message, stopping iteration.\r\n9) When the PySpark local iterator is garbage-collected, it will read any remaining data from the current partition (this is data that has already been collected) and send a request of zero to tell the JVM to stop collection jobs and close the connection.\r\n\r\nSteps 1, 3, 5, 6 are the same as before. Step 8 was completely missing before because errors in the worker were never communicated back to Python. The other steps add synchronization to allow for a clean closing of the socket, with a small trade-off in performance for each partition. This is mainly because the JVM does not start collecting partition data until it receives a request to do so, where before it would eagerly write all data until the socket receive buffer is full.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests for DataFrame and RDD `toLocalIterator` and tested not fully consuming the iterator. Manual tests with Python 2.7  and 3.6.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-12T18:02:28Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T17:43:29Z","closed_at":"2019-05-07T21:50:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e48ae450d3932de6c5f518720cbc3e123cb3a353","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24070/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24070/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24070/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4f842dcb812dc5b199a4b150fea21d8015eedea0","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:pyspark-toLocalIterator-clean-stop-SPARK-23961","ref":"pyspark-toLocalIterator-clean-stop-SPARK-23961","sha":"4f842dcb812dc5b199a4b150fea21d8015eedea0","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe data source option check_files_exist is introduced in In #23383 when the file source V2 framework is implemented. In the PR, FileIndex was created as a member of FileTable, so that we could implement partition pruning like 0f9fcab in the future. At that time `FileIndex`es will always be created for file writes, so we needed the option to decide whether to check file existence.\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23774, the option is not needed anymore, since Dataframe writes won't create unnecessary FileIndex. This PR is to remove the option.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`OrcFilters.createBuilder` has exponential complexity in the height of the filter tree due to the way the check-and-build pattern is implemented. We've hit this in production by passing a `Column` filter to Spark directly, with a job taking multiple hours for a simple set of ~30 filters. This PR changes the checking logic so that the conversion has linear complexity in the size of the tree instead of exponential in its height.\r\n\r\nRight now, due to the way ORC `SearchArgument` works, the code is forced to do two separate phases when converting a given Spark filter to an ORC filter:\r\n1. Check if the filter is convertible.\r\n2. Only if the check in 1. succeeds, perform the actual conversion into the resulting ORC filter.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's one detail which is the culprit in the exponential complexity: phases 1. and 2. are both done using the exact same method. The resulting exponential complexity is easiest to see in the `NOT` case - consider the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval f1 = col(\"id\") === lit(5)\r\nval f2 = !f1\r\nval f3 = !f2\r\nval f4 = !f3\r\nval f5 = !f4\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when we run `createBuilder` on `f5`, we get the following behaviour:\r\n1. call `createBuilder(f4)` to check if the child `f4` is convertible\r\n2. call `createBuilder(f4)` to actually convert it\r\n\r\nThis seems fine when looking at a single level, but what actually ends up happening is:\r\n- `createBuilder(f3)` will then recursively be called 4 times - 2 times in step 1., and two times in step 2.\r\n- `createBuilder(f2)` will be called 8 times - 4 times in each top-level step, 2 times in each sub-step.\r\n- `createBuilder(f1)` will be called 16 times.\r\n\r\nAs a result, having a tree of height > 30 leads to billions of calls to `createBuilder`, heap allocations, and so on and can take multiple hours.\r\n\r\nThe way this PR solves this problem is by separating the `check` and `convert` functionalities into separate functions. This way, the call to `createBuilder` on `f5` above would look like this:\r\n1. call `isConvertible(f4)` to check if the child `f4` is convertible - amortized constant complexity\r\n2. call `createBuilder(f4)` to actually convert it - linear complexity in the size of the subtree.\r\n\r\nThis way, we get an overall complexity that's linear in the size of the filter tree, allowing us to convert tree with 10s of thousands of nodes in milliseconds.\r\n\r\nThe reason this split (`check` and `build`) is possible is that the checking never actually depends on the actual building of the filter. The `check` part of `createBuilder` depends mainly on: \r\n- `isSearchableType` for leaf nodes, and\r\n- `check`-ing the child filters for composite nodes like NOT, AND and OR.\r\nSituations like the `SearchArgumentBuilder` throwing an exception while building the resulting ORC filter are not handled right now - they just get thrown out of the class, and this change preserves this behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis PR extracts this part of the code to a separate class which allows the conversion to make very efficient checks to confirm that a given child is convertible before actually converting it.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nBefore:\r\n- converting a skewed tree with a height of ~35 took about 6-7 hours.\r\n- converting a skewed tree with hundreds or thousands of nodes would be completely impossible.\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n- filtering against a skewed tree with a height of 1500 in the benchmark suite finishes in less than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n```scala\r\nval schema = StructType.fromDDL(\"col INT\")\r\n(20 to 30).foreach { width =>\r\n  val whereFilter = (1 to width).map(i => EqualTo(\"col\", i)).reduceLeft(Or)\r\n  val start = System.currentTimeMillis()\r\n  OrcFilters.createFilter(schema, Seq(whereFilter))\r\n  println(s\"With $width filters, conversion takes ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Before this PR\r\n```\r\nWith 20 filters, conversion takes 363 ms\r\nWith 21 filters, conversion takes 496 ms\r\nWith 22 filters, conversion takes 939 ms\r\nWith 23 filters, conversion takes 1871 ms\r\nWith 24 filters, conversion takes 3756 ms\r\nWith 25 filters, conversion takes 7452 ms\r\nWith 26 filters, conversion takes 14978 ms\r\nWith 27 filters, conversion takes 30519 ms\r\nWith 28 filters, conversion takes 60361 ms // 1 minute\r\nWith 29 filters, conversion takes 126575 ms // 2 minutes 6 seconds\r\nWith 30 filters, conversion takes 257369 ms // 4 minutes 17 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After this PR\r\n```\r\nWith 20 filters, conversion takes 12 ms\r\nWith 21 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 22 filters, conversion takes 1 ms\r\nWith 23 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 24 filters, conversion takes 1 ms\r\nWith 25 filters, conversion takes 1 ms\r\nWith 26 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 27 filters, conversion takes 1 ms\r\nWith 28 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 29 filters, conversion takes 1 ms\r\nWith 30 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThere are no changes in behaviour, and the existing tests pass. Added new benchmarks that expose the problematic behaviour and they finish quickly with the changes applied.","created_at":"2019-03-12T11:21:21Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T02:49:11Z","closed_at":"2019-06-19T02:49:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"918b894aaf510fcbd3ec4921c4888940fbf80f7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24068/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24068/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24068/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24dcc24cad757fd0cb052ae1f27a2a2937afaff7","head":{"label":"IvanVergiliev:optimize-orc-filters","ref":"optimize-orc-filters","sha":"24dcc24cad757fd0cb052ae1f27a2a2937afaff7","user":{"login":"IvanVergiliev","id":1443067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev","html_url":"https://github.com/IvanVergiliev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27491244,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzQ5MTI0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"IvanVergiliev/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"IvanVergiliev","id":1443067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev","html_url":"https://github.com/IvanVergiliev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IvanVergiliev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/IvanVergiliev/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse the sbt maven plugin option`antlr4TreatWarningsAsErrors` to make sure the warnings are treated as errors while generating the parser. In the absence of it, we may inadvertently introduce problems while making grammar changes. Please refer to PR-23897 to know more about the context. We made a change in [pr-23925](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23925) which handled only the maven build. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, we handle the sbt build. I had submitted [PR-23](https://github.com/ihji/sbt-antlr4/pull/23) to enhance the sbt-antlr plugin to make is possible to pass the error on warning option. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nForce an warning in the grammar file to check if the build fails. Then remove the warning to verify the build succeeds.","created_at":"2019-03-11T21:41:18Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T04:57:48Z","closed_at":"2019-03-12T04:30:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3eb896845409af64f8627831d41045697cd8bc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24060/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24060/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24060/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4c06b00d96d94dce1c3f0b14d89fe280b7791c6","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:sbt_build_antlr","ref":"sbt_build_antlr","sha":"f4c06b00d96d94dce1c3f0b14d89fe280b7791c6","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

this doesn't really resolve the JIRA, but makes the changes we can make so far that would be required to solve it.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJava 9+ changed how ClassLoaders work. The two most salient points:\r\n- The boot classloader no longer 'sees' the platform classes. A new 'platform classloader' does and should be the parent of new ClassLoaders\r\n- The system classloader is no longer a URLClassLoader, so we can't get the URLs of JARs in its classpath\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe'll see whether Java 8 tests still pass here. Java 11 tests do not fully pass at this point; more notes below. This does make progress on the failures though.\r\n\r\n(NB: to test with Java 11, you need to build with Java 8 first, setting JAVA_HOME and java's executable correctly, then switch both to Java 11 for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to standardise the column indexing of stack and json_tuple function,to follow one-based indexing.(as discussed on PR #23748 )\r\n\r\nThere is inconsistency in default column names for functions like stack and json_tuple. stack and json_tuple uses col0, col1 etc. (i.e. 0-indexed columns), while other functions like inline uses col1, col2, col2, etc. (i.e. 1-indexed columns).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-11T10:10:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T22:45:19Z","closed_at":"2019-11-06T22:45:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"554e606e3dc1ee11159b304dbeee39dbbc1618b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ce5414a9fe23fc9cfd60ca68cf24973a98e6207","head":{"label":"chakravarthiT:ColumnDef","ref":"ColumnDef","sha":"5ce5414a9fe23fc9cfd60ca68cf24973a98e6207","user":{"login":"chakravarthiT","id":45845595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT","html_url":"https://github.com/chakravarthiT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161616794,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjE2MTY3OTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"chakravarthiT/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chakravarthiT","id":45845595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT","html_url":"https://github.com/chakravarthiT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chakravarthiT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chakravarthiT/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr extended `ANALYZE` commands to analyze column stats for cached table.\r\n\r\nIn common use cases, users read catalog table data, join/aggregate them, and then cache the result for following reuse. Since we are only allowed to analyze column statistics in catalog tables via ANALYZE commands, the current optimization depends on non-existing or inaccurate column statistics of cached data. So, it would be great if we could analyze cached data as follows;\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> def printColumnStats(tableName: String) = {\r\n     |
