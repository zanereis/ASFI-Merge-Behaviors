Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-241\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n     (1) Add submitLineageEvent() to DataPublisher class. This allows different publisher create its own submission logic. For example, NoopPublisher can simply return success because no submission is not needed.  The default implementation was added inside BaseDataPublisher. The SafeDatasetCommit will simply invoke DataPublisher::submitLineageEvent without changing existing logic.\r\n\r\n     (2) Add submitSingleTaskLineageEvent() to SingleTaskDataPublisher class. This allows different task level publisher to submit lineage event. Default implementation is provided inside BaseDataPublisher.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    No test needed\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-236\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd a ControlMessage injector as a RecordStreamProcessor.\r\nA `ControlMessageInjector` inspects an incoming record and can inject `ControlMessages` based on the content of the incoming record.\r\n\r\nOne use case for this is the injection of `MetadataUpdateControlMessages` when the latest schema has been updated to trigger the update of the schema used by other constructs downstream from the `ControlMessageInjector`.\r\n\r\nLong running jobs are more likely to encounter issues due to the schema being updated after the start of the job.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA]\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-238\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n#### Motivation\r\nThe current implementation of `EnvelopeSchemaConverter` has several flaws:\r\n- Assumes top level payload schema field\r\n- Output record is the schema'ed payload but output schema is a String\r\n\r\nTo address the issues and improve envelope schema conversion, the task implements two types of `EnvelopeSchemaConverter`: `EnvelopePayloadConverter` and `EnvelopeSchemaDecorator`.\r\n\r\n#### `EnvelopePayloadConverter`\r\nThe previous `EnvelopeSchemaConverter` is transformed into `EnvelopePayloadConverter`. The logic to extract and output the deserialized payload is kept. But Fields projection logic is removed as it's a duplicate effort to `AvroProjectionConverter`.\r\n\r\nGiven an envelope record, the output schema will be the latest payload schema fetched from a kafka registry. The output record will be the deserialized payload with the latest schema\r\n\r\n#### `EnvelopeSchemaDecorator`\r\nGiven an envelope record, the output schema will set the payload field to have the latest schema fetched from a kafka registry and set the other fields as they are from the input schema. The output record will set the payload to be the deserialized object with the latest schema and set the other fields as they are from the input record\r\n\r\n#### Configurations\r\nOne configuration is required to set for any of the converters to work. It has no default value. \r\n```\r\n// The topic to fetch the latest schema of the payload from a kafka registry\r\nconverter.envelopeSchemaConverter.payloadSchemaTopic=\r\n```\r\nThe converter supports nested schema id\r\n```\r\nconverter.envelopeSchemaConverter.schemaIdField=\"metadata.payloadSchemaId\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests \r\n  1. `EnvelopePayloadConverterTest`\r\n  2. `EnvelopeSchemaDecoratorTest`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable): \r\nAzkaban Orchestrator for Gobblin-as-a-Service which will:\r\n- Use Azkaban APIs to create Azkaban project for jobs to execute\r\n- Schedule and execute these jobs as required by GaaS\r\nNote: This is supposed to be a single-tenant solution (1 job per user). Multi-tenancy will follow later.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests for non-API functionality, and tested on local Azkaban deployment\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-231\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n GrokToJsonConverter accepts already deserialized text row, String, where you can use.\r\n\r\n Converts Text to JSON based on Grok pattern. Schema is represented by the form of JsonArray same interface being used by CsvToJonConverter.\r\n Each text record is represented by a String.\r\n The converter only supports Grok patterns where every group is named because it uses the group names as column names.\r\n \r\n The following config properties can be set:\r\n\r\n-  The grok pattern to use for the conversion:\r\n` converter.grok_to_json.pattern=^%{IPORHOST:clientip} (?:-|%{USER:ident}) (?:-|%{USER:auth}) \\[%{HTTPDATE:timestamp}\\] \\\"(?:%{WORD:verb} %{NOTSPACE:request}(?: HTTP/%{NUMBER:httpversion})?|-)\\\" %{NUMBER:response} (?:-|%{NUMBER:bytes})\r\n` \r\n\r\n-  Path to the grok patterns (if not set it will use the default ones):\r\n` converter.grok_to_json.patterns=/tmp/grok_patterns` \r\n\r\n-  Treat empty string as null value:\r\n\r\n` converter.grok_to_json.empty_as_null=true` \r\n \r\n\r\n- Specify the null string:\r\n\r\n`converter.grok_to_json.null_string=null` \r\n \r\nExample of schema:\r\n```\r\n [\r\n  {\r\n    \"columnName\": \"Day\",\r\n    \"comment\": \"\",\r\n    \"isNullable\": \"true\",\r\n    \"dataType\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"columnName\": \"Pageviews\",\r\n    \"comment\": \"\",\r\n    \"isNullable\": \"true\",\r\n    \"dataType\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"long\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-214\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n  The listFilesRecursively from FileListUtils does not apply the pathFilter to all the individual files. Add listAllFiles to fix the filtering issue and simplify the listing procedure. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   testListAllFiles was added in FileListUtilsTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

An additional parameter will also be added to the Post request for registering the schema to specify the Kafka topic name.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Gobblin provides support for JDBC compliant databases through JDBCExtractor and JDBCSource. Postgresql is one of the most used RDBMS and adding a direct implementation of it in Gobblin could be useful for users. This implementation is inspired by the existing Mysql implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] org.apache.gobblin.source.jdbc.PostgresqlExtractorTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-197\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe current JDBCExtractor calls getString on a column in parseColumnAsString if it holds a clob, however this does not deserialize the clob into a readable string. This PR checks if the column's type is a clob. If so, get the Clob object from the result set and extract the Clob object's string by using its member function, getSubString.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIntegration testing done on extracting clob columns from Teradata. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-199\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAdd API for listing all entries in a state store. This is necessary for a common way to apply retention rules to state stores. Also implemented the listing methods for the FSDatasetStateStore. Will implement methods for other state stores in a future PR.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n--org.apache.gobblin.runtime.FsDatasetStateStoreTest#testGetMetadataForTables\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-195\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAbility to switch Avro schema namespace switch before registering with Kafka Avro Schema registry. This is useful when we want to maintain backward compatibility with the schema registered in the registry since registry does not allows for difference in namespace. \r\nThis however has no impact on write / read of actual Avro bytes for the event because they are mapped back to the fields irrespective of namespace. \r\n\r\nThrough this, if the following config is set, it will help gobblin-metrics be backwards compatible with the schema already registered in Kafka Avro Schema Registry: \r\n\r\nkafka.schemaRegistry.overrideNamespace = org.apache.gobblin.metrics:gobblin.metrics\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n@ibuenros Kindly review.\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIt will add dataset path in gobblintrackingevent_distcp_ng, which can be used to find the , partition type and dataset path of the datasel.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdding one more field to events is trivial. Hence test is not added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-167\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd dev tooling for signing releases. This will reduce multi-step process to a few for Apache releases.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRelease process is yet to be finalized, this script is to curate all required tooling.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

July 25th:\r\nAfter discussion with @abti and feature requestor we figured out the desired output is a configStore-based dataset finder plus glob-pattern support for filtering out some unwanted trash files. Only with ConfigStore this is impossible as configstore only have a logical view of dataset configuration, which is not necessary the same as the real dataset. Also configStore is not necessary to be implemented based on file system.\r\n\r\nThe approach here is to rely on configStore to finish dataset discovery first, and resolve the black/whitelist in the `ConfigBasedDataset.java` level, which in current stage only handles file system based dataset. \r\n\r\nAlso here we specified the semantics of two-level black/whitelist. The job-level black/whitelist is mainly for hot-fix in convenience of operation purpose, and it will NOT override config-based black/whitelist. That is, job-level black/whitelist is an enhancement not
