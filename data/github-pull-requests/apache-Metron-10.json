Contributor Comments\r\nThere is a corner-case where sometimes the Storm REST UI is stopped before the Metron topologies when 'STOP ALL' is selected from Ambari. This PR orders STORM_REST_API-STOP after the Metron topologies STOP.\r\n\r\nTo verify, spin up full-dev and select 'Stop All' from the UI.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds faceted search to indexing DAO.  This can be tested in full dev with Swagger.  When searching with the \"/api/v1/search/search\" endpoint adding a \"facetFields\" property with a list of fields as the value will return facet counts for those fields.  For example, for this request:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"facetFields\": [\r\n    \"ip_src_addr\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"bro\", \"snort\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 5\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA \"facetCounts\" property will be added to the result, looking similar to:\r\n```\r\n\"facetCounts\": {\r\n    \"ip_src_addr\": {\r\n      \"95.163.121.204\": 1913,\r\n      \"72.34.49.86\": 2159,\r\n      \"192.168.138.158\": 45167,\r\n      \"188.165.164.184\": 82,\r\n      \"192.168.138.2\": 120,\r\n      \"192.168.66.1\": 30771,\r\n      \"62.75.195.236\": 11513,\r\n      \"192.168.66.121\": 3793,\r\n      \"204.152.254.221\": 767\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the \"facetFields\" property is left out, the search will function the same.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR changes the metron-rest and metron-management-ui components to now check status with a curl command.  This should more accurately represent whether a service is running or not.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested in full dev by spinning up the environment and stopping the metron-rest and/or the metron-management-ui from the command line with `service metron-rest stop` or `service metron-management-ui stop`.  After a few seconds the status for these components in Ambari should turn red.  Start them again using the service command and the status in Ambari should turn back to green.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds the option to explicitly declare which fields should be returned in search results.  Adding a \"fields\" property to the search request with a list of fields as the value should only return those fields (timestamp is always returned).  This is an example search request that only returns the \"ip_src_addr\" field:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"fields\":[\"ip_src_addr\"],\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"bro\",\"snort\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 5\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be tested in full dev through the Swagger UI.  Execute this search request in the search-controller and fields should be returned appropriately.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nThis one is pretty straightforward. Our build outputs a large amount of avoidable WARNING noise. This PR cleans up quite a bit of low-hanging fruit, including:\r\n\r\n- The expression ${parent.version} is deprecated. Please use ${project.parent.version} instead.\r\n- Using platform encoding (UTF-8 actually) to copy filtered resources, i.e. build is platform dependent!\r\n- File encoding has not been set, using platform encoding UTF-8, i.e. build is platform dependent!\r\n- The assembly descriptor contains a filesystem-root relative reference, which is not cross platform compatible /bin\r\n- site-book: JAR will be empty - no content was marked for inclusion!\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of warnings pertaining to overlapping classes found during the shading process. And a number of npm related issues, e.g. \"npm WARN deprecated minimatch@2.0.10: Please update to minimatch 3.0.2 or higher to avoid a RegExp DoS issue\". This is not addressed by this work.\r\n\r\nTo test this, run full-dev and verify data flows through indexing. The biggest concern would be around the path changes (removing leading slash '/') in the assembly.xml files. In spite of the examples included in https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-assemblies.html, this results in a potentially platform-dependent build. Excluding leading slashes addresses these warnings.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

being that there IS a variable at all vs. there is a variable, and its value is NULL.\r\n\r\nReferenced variables in Stellar statements with the default variable resolver will throw ParseExceptions\r\nif they are not included or passed.  Other variable resolvers can implement this policy as they need.\r\nFor example the LambdaExpression's VariableResolver as well as the MapResolver used in enrichments and parsers allow missing variables, since the variable naming in the lambda expression is arbitrary and separate from the original call context.  This means that for StellarFieldTransforms and StellarEnrichment there is no change in behavior.\r\n\r\nThe context supports this by maintaining a thread local activity type, such that the context can be inspected for a validation vs. a parse operation. Variables are not present during validation and this is allowed.\r\n\r\nTests have been changed or updated ( hopefully ) to thier _intent_ where possible.  If they were testing\r\nfor handling a variable that *is* null vs a missing variable etc.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nThe VariableResolver interface now has a second function -> exists(). This allows for checking if there is a variable at all.  The resolve method would return null for both cases.   A new DefaultVariableResolver class has been created, to help callers who were only passing something like (x) -> hashMap.get(x),  to parse.\r\n\r\nThe ActivityType enum has been added ( see Context.java ).  It is stored as a thread local var in the Context.  We set this to Parse or Validate depending on the operation. We don't need to check during validation. It is a implemented as a thread local var to support instances where we use a single context in multiple threads.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAll tests should pass when building the product\r\nFull Dev should run and have data\r\n\r\n### Questions for Review\r\n\r\n1.  Are there issues here that are not accounted for with upgrading or ????\r\n2. I am not sure that some of the classes and interfaces in DSL shouldn't be in Common ( like VariableResolver ).\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR removes the explicit HDFS url property from the REST application and instead relies on core-site.xml for that property.  This makes the REST code simpler to configure and is more in line with how most HDFS clients work.  This should also enable the REST application to work in HFDS HA mode.\r\n\r\nI have verified all unit/integration tests and tested in full dev with Kerberos enabled.  To test this, navigate to Swagger in full dev and execute the various hdfs-controller methods.  They should all work without issue.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR makes the init scripts for metron-rest and metron-config OS-agnostic by:\r\n- moving the metron env file to \"/etc/default\" instead of \"/etc/sysconfig\"\r\n- using \"su -c ...\" to start the process instead of \"runuser ...\"\r\n- using the appropriate kill logic instead of \"killproc\"\r\n\r\nDuring testing I also uncovered a bug where the metron env file is not installed for the management UI if it and the REST application are installed on different hosts.  This PR fixes that bug as well. \r\n\r\nI have tested this for regressions in full dev and am in the process of testing in an Ubuntu cluster.  I will update this thread once that testing is completely.  Until then, please don't merge this PR.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

performance logging timers to the enrichment topology. I've made this configurable so that the timers are separate from our standard logging. Any opinions on documenting this, ie should it be added to the enrichment docs? I also noticed some performance logging added to the StellarAdapter class, but we haven't added documentation for the \"feature.\"\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRun full dev\r\n```\r\ncd metron/metron-deployment/vagrant/full-dev-platform\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Set the log levels**\r\n\r\nGo to the storm UI - http://node1:8744 and select the enrichment topology. Scroll down to \"Change Log Level\" and enter the following loggers, level=DEBUG, timeout=5000 sec:\r\n\r\n> org.apache.metron.enrichment.bolt.GenericEnrichmentBolt$Perf\r\n> org.apache.metron.enrichment.bolt.SplitBolt$Perf\r\n> org.apache.metron.enrichment.bolt.JoinBolt$Perf \r\n\r\nIn the enrichment worker log you should see lines similar to the following indicating that performance logging has been enabled:\r\n> 2017-07-21 20:53:42.673 o.a.s.d.worker [INFO] Adding config for: org.apache.metron.enrichment.bolt.SplitBolt$Perf with level: DEBUG\r\n> 2017-07-21 20:54:14.747 o.a.s.d.worker [INFO] Adding config for: org.apache.metron.enrichment.bolt.JoinBolt$Perf with level: DEBUG\r\n> 2017-07-21 20:54:39.914 o.a.s.d.worker [INFO] Adding config for: org.apache.metron.enrichment.bolt.GenericEnrichmentBolt$Perf with level: DEBUG\r\n\r\n**Check the log output**\r\n\r\nYou should see log entries similar to the following:\r\n\r\n> 2017-07-28 17:22:39.432 o.a.m.e.b.GenericEnrichmentBolt$Perf [DEBUG] markName=enrich,time(ns)=16992,message=key=9e21e859-9da8-40db-89b1-59d1395ceabb, time to run enrichment type=geo\r\n> 2017-07-28 17:23:28.148 o.a.m.e.b.JoinBolt$Perf [DEBUG] markName=execute,time(ns)=31933,message=key=4502ddc1-25db-4c33-a8d9-af8725ee1a44, elapsed time to run execute\r\n> 2017-07-28 17:26:57.478 o.a.m.e.b.SplitBolt$Perf [DEBUG] markName=split-message,time(ns)=23744,message=key=0caa19e3-786f-49f7-89bf-8f2900d56d38, elapsed time to split message\r\n> 2017-07-28 17:29:25.042 o.a.m.e.b.JoinBolt$Perf [DEBUG] markName=join-message,time(ns)=30122,message=key=a35950c1-a473-4172-afc3-61a8172d66fb, elapsed time to join messages\r\n> 2017-07-28 17:32:14.146 o.a.m.e.b.SplitBolt$Perf [DEBUG] markName=split-message,time(ns)=90933,message=key=4d5c2ac3-aea1-4010-b902-1b9726ee78ac, elapsed time to split message\r\n> 2017-07-28 17:32:48.825 o.a.m.e.b.SplitBolt$Perf [DEBUG] markName=emit,time(ns)=30827,message=key=4d4d54da-6033-4318-8855-425f017a6c32, elapsed time to run emit\r\n> 2017-07-28 17:32:50.866 o.a.m.e.b.GenericEnrichmentBolt$Perf [DEBUG] markName=execute,time(ns)=14299,message=key=5cba5c1c-2989-49dc-a1b6-6c561e956725, elapsed time to run execute\r\n\r\nAlso try changing the global config setting `performance.logging.percent.records` to something >= 10. The default is to log only 1% of the messages.\r\n\r\nChange $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json by adding the following key/value.\r\n`\"performance.logging.percent.records\" : 20`. Push the changes to Zookeeper and then verify the settings have persisted.\r\n\r\n```\r\n${METRON_HOME}/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -i ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper -m PUSH -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n${METRON_HOME}/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m DUMP -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow re-examine your logs again. You should see a much higher frequency of messages being logged. For extra credit, switch the setting back to 1% again and verify that the volume of logging statements has dropped significantly.\r\n\r\nThat should do it!\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds 2 additional search REST endpoints.  The first takes a list of indices as input and returns field to type mappings for each index.  The second also takes a list of indices as input but only returns field to type mappings for the intersection of the common fields across the indices.  These endpoints are needed by the alerts UI and will also be necessary for correctly formatting faceted search results.\r\n\r\nThis can been tested in full dev.  After spinning up full dev, go the the SearchController section of the Swagger UI.  There the endpoints can be tested against sample data in Elasticsearch.  Passing in \"[\"bro\",\"snort\"] to \"/api/v1/search/column/metadata\" should return type mappings for both indices.  Passing in the same list to \"/api/v1/search/column/metadata/common\" should only return type mappings for fields that are in both indices.\r\n\r\nReviewers will notice that tests were not added to the unit tests in ElasticsearchDaoTest.  As the original author of that class I found it awkward mocking the various Elasticsearch client classes and it took a non-trivial amount of time to figure out.  I started adding to the test for this PR and ran into similar issues.  I feel like this test will be difficult to maintain, especially since several different people will be contributing to this class, and I don't feel it gives us a good return on investment.  We have 100% test coverage in the integration tests which are much easier to maintain and understand.  Maybe there is an easier way to test Elasticsearch client classes but I vote we remove this and instead rely on the integration tests since they provide complete coverage and are easy to work with.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Ambari Metron MPack attempts to kill topologies that are not running.  It also attempts to start topologies that are already running.  It reports these conditions as errors.  The MPack should not report errors when attempting to stop an already stopped topology nor when starting an already started topology.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe Ambari MPack management scripts for the Parsers, Enrichment, and Indexing were all updated so that they only attempt to start topologies that are not running and only attempt to stop topologies that are running.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis can be tested in the Full Dev environment using the following steps.\r\n\r\n#### Indexing\r\n1. Launch Full Dev and ensure all Metron components are running. \r\n1. `storm kill indexing`\r\n1.  In Ambari, go to http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary and click Service Actions > Restart All.\r\n1. This action should complete successfully.

`metron-docker` at the top-level of the project seems to catch the attention of new users. Some then start using metron-docker to explore/try-out/demo Metron.  The `metron-docker` code that we have is not well-suited for this purpose. It is only really useful for development. It is not regularly tested and maintained like our Vagrant environment.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Moved `metron-docker` to `metron-contrib/metron-docker`.  I based the top-level name on a popular suggestion from the mailing list along with matching the existing top-level naming convention (metron-*).\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue with untar'ing the Kafka, HBase, and Hadoop tarballs.  It seems that the behavior of Docker's `ADD` now is to automatically untar.   That is at least in Docker for Mac version 17.06.0-ce-mac19.  I assume on older versions this was not the case,  I changed this logic to avoid using `ADD` so that it would work for older and newer versions of Docker.\r\n\r\n* Updated the documentation to make it clear that `metron-docker` is for development purposes only.\r\n\r\n* Also renamed the installation location of the core components.  For example instead of `/opt/hadoop-2.7.3` I changed it to `/opt/hadoop`.  This makes it so we don't have the specific version number for these components duplicated in a few different files.  \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI launched `metron-docker` based on the instructions in the README.  The entire Docker compose application launched successfully and I validated that I was able to hit all of the web interfaces outlined in the README.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-19T17:14:53Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T17:11:56Z","closed_at":"2017-07-25T17:11:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"091d90a28b32cbad8551f199904c62822464e4fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/659/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/659/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/659/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/81a1c80b6e4eff4521811af354acfb53bf3b52f6","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-1053","ref":"METRON-1053","sha":"81a1c80b6e4eff4521811af354acfb53bf3b52f6","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

the Profiler topology is running, but no Profiler definition is found in Zookeeper, the Profiler will now just calmly log a warning.  Previously the Profiler would throw a rather nasty looking exception.\r\n\r\nI also refactored the logic for Profile `expires` handling.  Previously, this code was not all in one place (`ProfileHBaseMapper` + `ProfileConfig`), which made it less than clear what units the code base supported for `expires`.   I refactored the code so that it is all in one place (`ProfileHBaseMapper`) and very clear what is happening to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nBeyond the automated tests that already test this functionality, a manual acceptance test would look like the following.\r\n\r\n1. Start Full Dev\r\n1. Complete all of the[ \"Installation\" steps here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler#installation).  At this point the Profiler will be running, but no Profiler configuration exists.\r\n1. Ensure that telemetry is being consumed by the Profiler.\r\n1. Open up the Storm logs and make sure that `IllegalArgumentException`s are not being logged. \r\n1. Also in the Storm logs, there should be a WARN log statement from the Profiler indicating that the configuration cannot be

Contributor Comments\r\nThe PR fixes a bug in the indexing topology where a disabled writer will cause messages to fail.  This happens because the BulkWriterComponent simply returns (line 118) when it should ack the message before returning.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested on full dev along with unit and integration tests.  To verify, spin up full dev and disable the hdfs writer for bro.  The indexing topology should now continue to function normally instead of the spout reporting failures.\r\n\r\nI also added a test case to ensure tuples are still acked when a writer is disabled.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAt the moment the math functions are woefully incomplete. \r\nWe should add at least the ones difficult or impossible to reconstruct using existing stellar primitives/math functions:\r\n* log10\r\n* log2\r\n* ln\r\n* sqrt\r\n* ceil\r\n* floor\r\n* sin\r\n* cos\r\n* tan\r\n\r\nIt should be sufficient to test these out in the Stellar REPL for manual evaluation.  I have also refactored and added a more robust suite of unit tests for existing basic math functions as well as these new ones.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Metron Management UI cannot start topologies in a kerberized environment.  This includes the Parser, Enrichment, and Indexing topologies.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Metron REST does not pass \"-ksp\" to the start topology commands. As a result, topologies that are started with the Management UI cannot start a producer against a kerberized Kafka.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Altered the `StormCLIWrapper` to add logging of the actual CLI commands that are executed.\r\n* The `-ksp` argument is always used (with Kerberos or not) when launching the Parser, Enrichment, and Indexing topologies.\r\n* Added a Spring property `kafka.security.protocol` that serves as the `-ksp` argument when launching the topologies.\r\n* Ambari sets this Spring property based on Kafka's own configuration in Ambari.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTo manually test this, validate that all of the topologies can be stopped and started using the Management UI and Swagger UI both before and after kerberization.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Full Dev environment.\r\n1. Stop then start the Parser topologies using the Management UI.\r\n1. Ensure that data is being consumed by the topologies and landing in the Elasticsearch indices.\r\n1. Kerberize the Full Dev environment [using these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-deployment/Kerberos-ambari-setup.md).\r\n1. Kerberize the Sensor Stubs.\r\n\r\n    Add the following to somewhere near the top of `/etc/init.d/sensor-stubs`.\r\n    ```\r\n    export KAFKA_OPTS=\"-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/usr/metron/0.4.1/client_jaas.conf\"\r\n    ```\r\n    Add the `--security-protocol`.\r\n    ```\r\n    sed -i 's/node1:6667 --topic/node1:6667 --security-protocol PLAINTEXTSASL --topic/' /opt/sensor-stubs/bin/start-*-stub\r\n    ```\r\n    Restart the stubs.\r\n    ```\r\n    for sensorstub in bro snort; do\r\n        service sensor-stubs stop ${sensorstub};\r\n        service sensor-stubs start ${sensorstub};\r\n    done\r\n    ```\r\n1. Ensure data is being sent to the Parsers from the Sensor Stubs.\r\n    ```\r\n    export KAFKA_OPTS=\"-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/usr/metron/0.4.1/client_jaas.conf\"\r\n    /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --security-protocol PLAINTEXTSASL --topic bro\r\n    /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --security-protocol PLAINTEXTSASL --topic snort\r\n    ```\r\n1. Ensure that the Parsers are sending data to the Enrichment topology.\r\n    ```\r\n    export KAFKA_OPTS=\"-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/usr/metron/0.4.1/client_jaas.conf\"\r\n    /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --security-protocol PLAINTEXTSASL --topic enrichments\r\n    ```\r\n1. Stop the Bro & Snort topology using the Management UI.\r\n1. Start the Bro topology using the Management UI.\r\n1. Ensure that the Bro Parser is sending data to the Enrichment topology.\r\n    ```\r\n    export KAFKA_OPTS=\"-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/usr/metron/0.4.1/client_jaas.conf\"\r\n    /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --security-protocol PLAINTEXTSASL --topic enrichments\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAmbari should allow the metron_jdbc_platform option to be set to '' which it currently does not.  To verify, you should be able to spin up full dev, navigate to the REST tab and set that property to ''.  This is needed when configuring MySQL for Metron REST because this property must be '' and not 'mysql'.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR properly sets the topology worker opts property for enrichment and indexing topologies.  To test, spin up full dev and enable kerberos.  Both enrichment and indexing should run without error.  I also added other worker options in Ambari and verified the topologies still functioned without error.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Not having a hit in the database is an expected condition and processing should continue without the errant log message.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTo test this change, setup a Metron environment with GeoIP enrichment enabled.  Ingest some telemetry containing an valid, external IPv4 address that is not contained within the GeoIP database.   You can use an IP like `203.0.113.1` as the range 203.0.113.0/24 is reserved for \"TEST-NET-3\" and should never be locatable.  Before this PR, you will see the noted error message in the Enrichment topology logs.  With this change, you will not see the error message in your logs.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAdded a hash function to stellar. Many unit tests were created. Along with these tests I opened the Stellar terminal and did the following:\r\n\r\n### Start Stellar\r\n```bash\r\nmvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell\" -pl metron-stellar/stellar-common/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test `HASH` Function\r\n\r\nBelow is the output of some of the tests I ran. To get all available inputs for the second argument you can call `Security.getAlgorithms(\"MessageDigest\")` and print out the array. However, 'SHA-1', 'MD5', and 'SHA-256' are required by all Java platforms. Please see [MessageDigest](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html) and [Security](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/Security.html). \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[Stellar]>>> Functions loaded, you may refer to functions now...\r\n\r\n[Stellar]>>> some_string := 'my string to hash'\r\n[Stellar]>>> HASH(some_string, 'md5')\r\nE08863A4BE232F166C350F45C9DAA586\r\n[Stellar]>>> some_serializable_object := [ 1, 2, 3 ]\r\n[Stellar]>>> HASH(some_serializable_object, 'MD5')\r\n2383CD011F1DA06A173ADE2F3F99CF62\r\n[Stellar]>>> \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe PR adds a simple Elasticsearch REST endpoint that can execute simple queries.  This will serve as the foundation for building more complex Elasticsearch functions.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested with integration tests or in full dev.  To test is full dev, navigate to Swagger through Ambari and look for the \"search-controller\".  Here you can perform simple queries against data in Elasticsearch.  For example, posting this query should give back correct search results:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"bro\", \"snort\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 10,\r\n  \"sort\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"timestamp\",\r\n      \"sortOrder\": \"desc\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote:  Swagger gives an example query with sortOrder = 'DESC'.  As of now this needs to be lowercase but I'm considering changing it to accept both.  \r\n\r\nI still need to come up with a good description and add it to the README so that is still pending.  Still wanted to put this up for review as it is fairly large and the first time any Elasticsearch-related code has been added to REST.  Looking forward to the community's feedback.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR makes a couple of improvements to our integration tests.  \r\n\r\nEnrichment and integration tests now set properties using the same templates as the Ambari MPack.   This will make our tests easier to maintain because there is now a single source of properties.  Any addition/subtraction/modification to those properties will be detected in the tests.\r\n\r\nThe EnrichmentIntegrationTest now uses a single flux file instead of having a dedicated test flux file.  This was problematic because a) two flux files needed to be maintained for one topology and b) the test flux file could easily become stale and no longer accurately represent the enrichment topology (this happened to me on METRON-990).  The introduction of Stellar (this test was written a while ago) makes it possible to simulate an error so a modified topology/flux file with an error generating bolt is no longer required.\r\n\r\nAs a result of adding an error-generating Stellar statement I encountered a bug in the GenericEnrichmentBolt.  The exception thrown by the Stellar adapter was being reported twice: once on line 235 and again on line 275.  I attempted to fix this by removing the \"error\" flag and just reporting the error right when it happens.  There are likely multiple ways to do this so I want to highlight this class for reviewers.  Suggestions and scrutiny needed here.\r\n\r\nTesting this is simple:  all tests should pass without issue.  Any change to the templates or enrichment flux file should break the tests.  I also ensured full dev starts up without issue. \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR separates the various configurations in Ambari into different *-env.xml files.  Doing this allows us to create more granular dependencies so that a configuration change only requires a restart of the affected components and not the whole service.  Previously any change to any configuration would require every Metron component to be restarted.  There was also a small amount of refactoring done to the enrichment and indexing topics in MPack scripts to make them more clear and consistent.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested by spinning up full dev and changing various configurations.  A configuration change should now only prompt to restart the affected components instead of all components.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nFix a path typo\r\n\r\nTo test is trivial, but unfortunately requires building and then launching quick-dev or other install, then invoke the stellar shell script.  If it launches successfully the bug is fixed.  It currently errors on a Class Not Found error.\r\n\r\nI've opened METRON-1015 to create an integration test for this issue (problem in the CLI independent of the Stellar executor).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAlthough 52 files were nominally involved, I really only changed two things:\r\n1. replaced the 0.3.1 current-book with the new 0.4.0 site-book, via direct copy from the release image (that's 51 of the files!)\r\n2. updated documentation/index.md to change 0.3.1 to 0.4.0 and get rid of vestigial uses of \"incubator\" and \"incubating\"\r\n\r\n## Pull Request

Contributor Comments\r\nThis is a PR to METRON-1011. \r\nCurrently the Stellar functions ENRICHMENT_EXISTS and ENRICHMENT_GET only check for params 'enrichment_type' and 'indicator' to be submitted by the user. In reality all 4 params are mandatory as ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions are thrown at anything less than 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (old behaviour):\r\nfirst do a valid Stellar enrichment_get: \r\nENRICHMENT_GET(null,null,null,null)\r\n\r\nnow issue:\r\nENRICHMENT_GET(null)\r\n\r\nYou'll get \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Requires at least an enrichment type and indicator\" which makes one believe only 2 parameters are mandatory\r\n\r\nBut in fact all 4 parameters are mandatory, as anything less then 4 will get you:\r\nENRICHMENT_GET(null,null,null)\r\n[!] Index: 3, Size: 3\r\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 3, Size: 3\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n\r\n--------------\r\nNew behaviour:\r\nAnything but exactly 4 parameters will get you:\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: All parameters are mandatory, submit 'enrichment type', 'indicator', 'nosql_table' and 'column_family'\r\n\r\nA much clearer problem statement..\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root incubating-metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && build_utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  mvn site\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your personal repository such that your branches are built there before submitting a pull request.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-03T10:22:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T16:34:32Z","closed_at":"2017-08-01T16:34:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e9f57026b8da1f9e3296e9cbcc104c8ce27d740a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/628/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/628/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/628/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/91e42ca85a398a25cb79f5739937e1ddf4daab99","head":{"label":"jasper-k:master","ref":"master","sha":"91e42ca85a398a25cb79f5739937e1ddf4daab99","user":{"login":"jasper-k","id":6223443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjM0NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6223443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k","html_url":"https://github.com/jasper-k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96091971,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjA5MTk3MQ==","name":"metron-apache","full_name":"jasper-k/metron-apache","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jasper-k","id":6223443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjM0NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6223443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k","html_url":"https://github.com/jasper-k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasper-k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jasper-k/metron-apache","description":"Mirror

Contributor Comments\r\nThe Release Process document at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Release+Process\r\ncurrently states that a file named DISCLAIMER is a required artifact in the release package.  The contents of this file are:\r\n```\r\nApache Metron is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software\r\nFoundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required\r\nof all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the\r\ninfrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in\r\na manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status\r\nis not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,\r\nit does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.\r\n```\r\nThis clearly seems to be left over from our incubation days.  I propose to entirely remove the DISCLAIMER file, from the source tree and from the Release Process document.\r\n\r\nThe usual disclaimers remain in the LICENSE file, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR cleans up and speeds up various issues we've seen on Travis.\r\n\r\n- This should avoid the skadoo, by just outright stopping problematic threads.\r\n- Allows for the reuse of some of the InMemoryComponents, to avoid a lot of the spinup time in tests\r\n- Improvements to a variety of tests to make them faster\r\n- Refactoring of some parser integration tests to be less integrationy and more unit test-ish.  Specifically because not every parser needs a full integration test and they take awhile.\r\n- Moving to VM in Travis\r\n- More details as provided in comments\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\norg.apache.metron.parsers.utils.ParserUtils.convertToEpoch parses dates incorrectly.\r\nIt invokes method \"get(Calendar.MONTH)\" from  Calendar object but not increase result value.\r\nAccording to documentation months are started from 0: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html#MONTH)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nImport ParserUtils and call convertToEpoch method with any parameters.\r\nFor example:\r\n`Long ts = ParserUtils.convertToEpoch(\"Mar\", \"2\", \"05:24:39\", true);`\r\nMethod will return **1486013079000**. And after converting to human format: \r\n**Thu, 02 Feb 2017 05:24:39 GMT**\r\nGot \"Feb\" instead of \"Mar\"\r\n\r\nExample of code for manual testing:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.metron.parsers.utils.ParserUtils;\r\nimport java.text.ParseException;\r\n\r\nclass Main {\r\n        public static void main(String[] argv) throws ParseException {\r\n                Long ts = ParserUtils.convertToEpoch(\"Mar\", \"2\", \"05:24:39\", true);\r\n                System.out.println(ts);\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo run:\r\n```\r\njavac -cp ~/incubator-metron/metron-platform/metron-parsers/target/classes/  Main.java\r\njava -classpath ~/incubator-metron/metron-platform/metron-parsers/target/classes/:.

be able to answer the types of questions that I outlined in [METRON-450](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-450), we need a row key that is decodable. Right now there is no logic to decode a row key, nor is the existing row key easily decodable.\r\n\r\nOnce the row keys can be decoded, you could scan all of the row keys in the Profiler's HBase table, decode each of them and extract things like, the names of all your profiles, the names of entities within a profile, the period duration of a given profile.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Do not merge.  Opening this PR for review and feedback. \r\n- [x] This change is now backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/vagrant/full-dev-platform/\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Free up a slot by stopping the Snort topology.\r\n    ```\r\n    storm kill snort\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install the Profiler according to the [installation instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler#installation), but don't start the Profiler topology just yet.\r\n\r\n1. Change the window/period duration to 1 minute in the Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd /usr/metron/0.4.0\r\n    sed -i 's/15/1/' config/profiler.properties\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Change the window/period duration to 1 minute in the Profiler Client.  Add the `profiler.client.period.duration` property to your global settings.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.4.0]# cat config/zookeeper/global.json\r\n    {\r\n        \"es.clustername\": \"metron\",\r\n        \"es.ip\": \"node1:9300\",\r\n        \"es.date.format\": \"yyyy.MM.dd.HH\",\r\n        \"parser.error.topic\": \"indexing\",\r\n        \"profiler.client.period.duration\": \"1\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Define a profile in a file located at `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json`.\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"onlyif\":  \"exists(ip_src_addr)\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently, we only ingest data in Metron. Often, there is valuable metadata constructed up-stream of Metron that is relevant to enrichment and cross-cuts many data formats. Take, for instance, a multi-tenancy case where multiple sources come in and you'd like to tag the data with the customer ID. In this case you're stuck finding ways to add the metadata to each data source's format. Rather than do that, we should allow metadata to be ingested along with the data associated with it.\r\n\r\nThere are two sources of metadata relevant to support:\r\n* User defined metadata (e.g. customer IDs)\r\n* Environmental metadata (e.g. the kafka topic)\r\n\r\nIn this PR, metadata can be expressed and passed into metron in two manners:\r\n* As a JSON Map in the key of the message (optional)\r\n* The kafka topic written.\r\n\r\nMetadata is exposed in two ways:\r\n* As stellar variables for Stellar field transformations\r\n* Optionally, automatically merged with the message\r\n\r\nTwo properties were added to the parser config:\r\n* `mergeMetadata` - default false.  If true, then metadata is merged with the message.\r\n* `readMetadata` - default false.  If true, then user and environmental metadata are attempted to be read.\r\n\r\nNote: This is backwards compatible, so by default, unless specified, your parser topologies will function as before.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nMetron being a cybersecurity framework has the capability to raise alerts based on the events it processes. It would be nice to have a GUI to view these alerts and an option to integrate with any external workflow systems.\r\n\r\nA GUI design for viewing the alerts has been discussed in the community a while back (community discussion link is attached to the JIRA). This PR is a first pass to have a UI around alerts. \r\n\r\nThe current implementation is a standalone GUI implementation  i.e  the GUI connects to Elastic search for showing the alerts but the GUI stores all other data in the browser cache. Below are the GUI features and how they manage their data.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n**List Alerts:** The alert list page displays the alerts generated by the metron framework in a table. \r\n\r\n- By default, the table shows the recent alerts on the top i.e alerts are sorted descending on timestamp\r\n- The GUI polls for the alerts and the polling interval is configurable\r\n- The polling is paused when user opens any other configuration panes\r\n- The table shows only the columns that could be displayed in its horizontal view port any additional columns would be hidden. These hidden columns would be visible if the UI is opened in a display that has a wider view port\r\n- The table column width is fixed and any text exceeding the allotted width would be displayed using center ellipses\r\n\r\n**Search Alerts:** Users can search for alerts using the search bar above the alerts table.\r\n\r\n- The search query follows lucene syntax\r\n- User can click on any text in the table to add it as a search parameter\r\n- When user mouseovers on a search text a cross icon appears at the end of search text, clicking on the cross icon would remove the search filter and the operator following or preceding it\r\n- There is a cross icon on the search box itself that would clear the search\r\n\r\n**Configure Table Columns:** When a user selects the gear icon on the table header a pane appears that lists all the columns available across all the valid search indexes. \r\n\r\n- User can choose the columns that he wishes to view on the UI\r\n- User can configure the order in which the selected columns should appear in the table (Using the arrow icons)\r\n- User can rename the columns name Ex: 'enrichments:geo:ip_dst_addr:country' can be renamed to 'Dst Country'. This is just for display convenience and the changes are not propagated to any system in Metron\r\n\r\n**Configure Table Row Settings:** When user selects the 'slides' icon on top of the table he gets an option to choose the following table settings \r\n\r\n- Refresh Interval\r\n- Table Size\r\n- HIDE Resolved Alerts &  HIDE Dismissed Alerts, these are non-functional features and can be used as global filters for filtering alerts that would be displayed when integrated with any workflow systems\r\n\r\n**Save Search:** When a user selects the save button next to the search box he gets an option to save the current search. The last searched search parameters can be saved along with the current column configuration. User's should give a name for the search he wishes to save.\r\n\r\n**Saved Searches:** When a user selects the 'Searches' button present before the search box he can see all his saved searches. Last five executed searches are also shown in this pane as a convenience. The pane also provides an option to deleted the saved searches.\r\n\r\n| UI Component                             | API Type                                 |\r\n| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\r\n| List Alerts                              | Fetches data from ES                     |\r\n| Configure Table Columns                  | Fetches all columns names across all indexes from ES and saves the user-selected columns to browser cache |\r\n| Search Alerts                            | Fetches data from ES using query_string  |\r\n| Save Last 5 Recent Searches              | Saves data into browser cache and fetches data from browser cache |\r\n| Saved Searches (Saves search query and column selection) | Saves data into browser cache and fetches data from browser cache |\r\n| Table Settings - Refresh Interval & Page Size | Saves data into browser cache and fetches data from browser cache |\r\n\r\n*This is a big pull request and I understand that I am asking a lot already. If reviewers feel they have found a critical bug that should be fixed before this can be accepted, please let me know I  will address it ASAP. Otherwise, I can create Jiras for bugs/issues that can be done as follow-on work.*\r\n\r\n### Not-Yet-Functional\r\n\r\nAlert Status Fields in Table: This field is just an indicator of how we can integrate with any other workflow management systems\r\n\r\n HIDE Resolved Alerts &  HIDE Dismissed Alerts in Table Settings: These fields just show how we can use global filters to filter the data that is displayed\r\n\r\n### Testing the PR\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites:** \r\n\r\n* Elastic search should be up and running and should have alerts populated by metron topologies\r\n* The alerts can be populated using Quick Dev, Full Dev  or any other setup\r\n* node.JS >= 7.8.0\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the UI features can be verified using any one of the two approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Using Development Server\r\n2. Installing on an existing Cluster\r\n\r\n**Using Development Server:** \r\n\r\n1. Install all the dependent node_modules using the following command\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd incubator-metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n2. UI can be run by using the following command\r\n\r\n```\r\n./scripts/start-dev.sh\r\n```\r\n**NOTE**: *In the development mode ui by default connects to ES at http://node1:9200 for fetching data. If you wish to change it you can change the ES url at incubator-metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts/proxy.conf.json*\r\n\r\n**Installing on an existing Cluster:**\r\n1. Build Metron\r\n```\r\nmvn clean package -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n2. Copy `incubator-metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts/target/metron-alerts-METRON_VERSION-archive.tar.gz` to the desired host.\r\n3. Untar the archive in the target directory.  The directory structure will look like:\r\n```\r\nbin\r\n   start_alerts_ui.sh\r\nweb\r\n   alerts-ui\r\n     package.json\r\n     server.js\r\n     web assets (html, css, js, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. [Expressjs](https://github.com/expressjs/express) web server script is included in the build that will serve the application. Start the application with the script:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ./bin/start_alerts_ui.sh\r\n    Usage: server.js -p [port] -r [restUrl]\r\n    Options:\r\n      -p  Port to run metron alerts ui [required]\r\n      -r, --resturl  Url where elastic search rest api is available  [required]\r\n```\r\n\r\n ### UI Automation Testing \r\n\r\nThe UI has e2e tests written using protractor. These test cases can be extended as per need. The steps to run the e2e test are as follows.\r\n\r\nAn expressjs server is available for mocking the elastic search api.\r\n\r\n1. Run e2e webserver :\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd incubator-metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts\r\nsh ./scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. run e2e test using the following command \r\n\r\n```\r\ncd incubator-metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts\r\nnpm run e2e\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Next\r\n\r\nAs stated this is a first pass for building a UI for alerts. The following could be the next possible steps. \r\n\r\n- A Rest based middleware to abstract the GUI from the alerts repository. metron-rest is a good candidate to host such rest api's\r\n- More features like faceting, grouping can be added to the GUI\r\n- Improvements to the existing search mechanism to make it simpler\r\n\r\n## Review Summary\r\n\r\nAs this is a significantly large PR I will try to summarize the discussions in the below table.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis is a work-in-progress fix for Elasticsearch ES5 with Xshield client support. I'm opening a pull request to work through the remaining issues with the team. To be clear, the aim is discussion only for now, not for actually pulling in the code. @jasper-k verified the patch is working against a ES5.x Xpack enabled cluster.\r\n\r\nOpen issues in this pull request:\r\n- To have Storm and Elasticsearch 5.x client happily working together it's needed to have a Storm version that is compiled with log4j-core en log4j-api versions 2.8. This is already merged in the Storm sourcecode (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2326), however this fix is not shipping with HDP2.5.x. This fix is shipping withing the HDP 2.6 release.\r\n- While the metron-elasticsearch unit and integration tests are working, the ElasticsearchDataPrunerTest from metron-datamanagement are not. It can't seem to initialize ElasticSearch classes (e.g. java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.elasticsearch.common.ParseField). It seems to be related with this issue: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21627 . I could use some help with resolving this. \r\n- The ES server used in the integration test is not using Xpack authentication. I could not find any public reference on creating an x-pack authentication enabled server via their SDK . Xpack authentication is confirmed to work for the Storm Writer bolt, but no integration test can be added until this issue is resolved.\r\n- I've updated the index template for yaf as used in the integration tests to be ES5.x compatible. Other index templates need the same treatment\r\n- ES & Kibana Mpacks are not updated.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-19T10:04:28Z","updated_at":"2018-02-10T19:55:56Z","closed_at":"2018-02-10T19:55:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a89ea53fd1223ea68cbf16cda54517e21afe8976","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/b8311355f3cfb67055689e27d595cfe11ef4387b","head":{"label":"wardbekker:elasticsearch","ref":"elasticsearch","sha":"b8311355f3cfb67055689e27d595cfe11ef4387b","user":{"login":"wardbekker","id":35603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker","html_url":"https://github.com/wardbekker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94150966,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDE1MDk2Ng==","name":"metron","full_name":"wardbekker/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wardbekker","id":35603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker","html_url":"https://github.com/wardbekker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wardbekker/metron","description":"Mirror

Contributor Comments\r\nIt appears that github permanently closes any PR that gets rebased, hence for the history and discussion to date, I can only point you at the previous incarnation of this PR: https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/610\r\n\r\nThe design document has been available for some time at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EP7Jt4ePHe2A-_oboLl2QbN1muh7uKeET_kbpIgjcJM/edit#\r\nI have now added a new section, starting on p. 7, titled \"Retrospective: Changes made for Parts 1 & 2\" that details the specific changes actually done in this PR to extract Stellar.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\nThe intent of these changes is to achieve an architecture change WITHOUT any functional change.  The continued working of all unit tests, integration tests and real-world applications should result.  In addition, it generates (in metron-stellar/stellar-common/target) a stellar-common uber-jar (including all dependencies), which among other things can run the Stellar shell as a stand-alone Java application (although missing those Stellar functions that remain as part of Metron):\r\n```\r\njava -cp target/stellar-common-0.4.0-uber.jar \\\r\n    org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell\r\n```\r\nFor testing within Metron, the stellar classes are still incorporated into the metron-common jar and RPM, so test installation should work as before.\r\n\r\nFor a general test plan for all Stellar functionality within Metron, please see #468 's test plan. \r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root incubating-metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && build_utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [IN PROCESS] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book?

Contributor Comments\r\nIf you construct a variable which returns a map in a stellar enrichment, it is not able to be used in statements afterwards due to the fact that we explode the map.\r\nFor instance, an enrichment like so:\r\n```\r\nfoo := { 'foo' : 7}\r\nfoo_num := MAP_GET('foo', foo)\r\nfoo := null\r\n```\r\nwould yield the following fields:\r\n* `foo.foo == 7` \r\n* `foo_num := null` \r\n\r\nWhat we would prefer is just `foo_num == 7` because we've explicitly set the map variable to `null` and removed it.  As a policy, we should only explode the fields which are maps that are around at the end of the enrichments. Also, the map itself should be available to be used in downstream enrichments.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is mainly a refactor of the enrichment and indexing flux files along with their matching property files.  The changes include:\r\n\r\n- moving important settings with hardcoded values in flux files to property files so that they are configurable through Ambari\r\n- removing old and unused properties\r\n- elasticsearch.properties file is now implemented as a jinja2 template in the mpack, matching the enrichment.properties implementation\r\n- global.json is now implemented as a jinja2 template in the mpack\r\n- properties are now organized in Ambari as separate tabs and sub sections, hopefully making them easier to find\r\n- changed a couple properties to use a dropdown widget in Ambari\r\n\r\nI wrote descriptions for new properties in a similar style as existing properties.  I feel the descriptions are a little short, curious if others agree.  I also stopped short of improving ALL our properties with better widgets than just a text box.  I imagine people will have opinions on how to best present properties in Ambari but this is a start.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested on full dev with the usual process.  When reviewing, spin up full dev and navigate to the Metron service in Ambari.  The Config section should look as described in the section above.  The enrichment.properties and elasticsearch.properties should look much shorter and easier to read.\r\n\r\nOne more thing.  I added a rat exception for *.json.j2 since we already have an exception for *.json (no comments in json is the reason?).  Let me know if that's wrong.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, this mixes a couple things together.  I originally intended to get rid of JUnit3 code, and ended up having to untangle the config based testing.  This dovetails with https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/579.  It can be separated if desired (it's primarily just changing imports).\r\n\r\nThe primary change is to rip out a ton of stuff around the configuration testing that seemed entirely pointless.  It hasn't run in forever anyway, so cutting it down and leaving just straightforward unit tests seemed much more reasonable.\r\n\r\nMETRON-962 technically isn't probably quite complete, because I didn't add any integration tests or anything to this, but I'd rather split that into a separate JIRA and just consider this one \"getting the integration tests working\".  If we want to do that, I can adjust ticket name (or we can leave it as-is).\r\n\r\n~The GrokAsaParserTest works now, but required changes to the parser.  One is to point to the correct resource location, and the other is to refer to the specific cisco tag element.  I think this is valid and I'm honestly pretty sure it didn't work before on the basis of the resource location.  If someone can prove me wrong, I'm inclined to revert the parser and just leave the test `@Ignore`.  Does anything even use this parser? Could we just outright delete it?~\r\n\r\nI killed `GrokAsaParser` and the associated test. Assuming nobody has a problem with killing it, it seems like the way to go, as commented below.\r\n\r\n`BasicFireEyeParser` has a `System.out.println` commented out.  I'd delete it, but everything else is commented in that file, so I just commented it out.\r\n\r\nThere is some minor duplication in some of the `@Test` methods, but I'm not sure we care to refactor it much more than this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/metron/pull/88 appears to have deleted the test files, but I don't know if there was any actual intent.  I assume they just got lost in the shuffle.  They are restored and slightly renamed.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe design document has been available for some time at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EP7Jt4ePHe2A-_oboLl2QbN1muh7uKeET_kbpIgjcJM/edit#\r\nI have now added a new section, starting on p. 7, titled \"Retrospective: Changes made for Parts 1 & 2\" that details the specific changes actually done in this PR to extract Stellar.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\nThe intent of these changes is to achieve an architecture change WITHOUT any functional change.  The continued working of all unit tests, integration tests and real-world applications should result.  In addition, it generates (in metron-stellar/stellar-common/target) a stellar-common uber-jar (including all dependencies), which among other things can run the Stellar shell as a stand-alone Java application (although missing those Stellar functions that remain as part of Metron):\r\n```\r\njava -cp target/stellar-common-0.4.0-uber.jar \\\r\n    org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell\r\n```\r\nNote that this PR does not yet have RPM generation (Step 6).  Thus, the Stellar jar will need to be manually added to the lib/ directory of test deployments.\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root incubating-metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && build_utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [IN PROCESS] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently, stellar enrichments are specified by a map associating fields with the stellar expressions associated with the fields. There is a significant downside here in that you cannot update previously assigned fields. For instance, the following cannot be represented currently:\r\n```\r\n \"fieldMap\": {\r\n       ...\r\n      \"stellar\" : {\r\n        \"config\" : {\r\n          \"hostname\" : \"if ENDS_WITH(hostname, '.') then CHOP(hostname) else hostname\",\r\n          \"hostname\" : \"TO_LOWER(hostname)\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis would now be allowed thusly:\r\n```\r\n\"fieldMap\": {\r\n       ...\r\n      \"stellar\" : {\r\n        \"config\" : [\r\n          \"hostname := if ENDS_WITH(hostname, '.') then CHOP(hostname) else hostname\",\r\n          \"hostname := TO_LOWER(hostname)\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nA consequent of this deficiency is that we also cannot use temporary variables and unset them after their use inside an enrichment group.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is to allow users to use lists of strings representing stellar expression assignments with the same syntax as the Stellar REPL. This would be as an alternative to maps, but the map syntax would also be supported for legacy.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n* Follow the instructions located [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-enrichment#example-enrichment-via-stellar) to ensure no regressions\r\n* Adjust the configuration for `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/enrichments/squid.json` to the following and run data through the topologies again:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n \"enrichment\" : {\r\n   \"fieldMap\": {\r\n     \"stellar\" : {\r\n       \"config\" : {\r\n         \"numeric\" : [\r\n                     \"foo := 1 + 1\",\r\n                     \"grok := foo + 3\"\r\n                     ]\r\n         ,\"ALL_CAPS\" : \"TO_UPPER(source.type)\"\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n },\r\n \"threatIntel\" : {\r\n   \"fieldMap\":{\r\n    \"stellar\" : {\r\n       \"config\" : [\r\n         \"bar := TO_UPPER(source.type)\"\r\n       ]\r\n     } \r\n   },\r\n   \"triageConfig\" : {\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n  * Ensure that each message has `ALL_CAPS`, `foo`, `grok` and `bar` fields.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Changes\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been made to Fastcapa to improve interoperability with the Intel X520 NIC, address bugs uncovered during performance testing, and some basic enhancements to improve ease-of-use.\r\n\r\n  * Created a separate command-line parameter for the transmit worker burst size; `-w TX_BURST_SIZE`.  This defines the maximum number of packets dequeued from the transmit ring and enqueued for delivery to Kafka at one time.  Previously the burst size for the receive and transmit worker were the same.  In practice the transmit worker burst size needs to be roughly 10x greater than the receive worker burst size.\r\n\r\n  * Fixed a bug that caused some failures reported through the message delivery callback to be ignored.  Both successful and failed deliveries are reported through this callback and the logic has been corrected to match this.\r\n\r\n  * Error messages for each failed message can be logged when the `DEBUG` flag is used during compilation.  By default errors for each message are not logged due to performance implications.\r\n\r\n  * Now logging all configuration parameters by default.\r\n\r\n  * The code was unnecessarily limiting `-x TX_RING_SIZE` by using a uint16_t; a 32-bit value is perfectly acceptable.  Also, no need to validate the -x TX_RING_SIZE as DPDK's EAL does this for us.  \r\n\r\n  * Added separate default port configurations for the receive and transmit side.  Previously the same configuration values were used for both.\r\n\r\n  * Added logic to count, summarize and report all ethernet device errors.\r\n\r\n  * Refactored logic so that all receive and transmit worker logic is contained within `worker.[c|h]` and all NIC logic contained within `nic.[c|h]`.\r\n\r\n  * Updated the fastcapa service script to allow the process to be stopped, killed, and the logs tailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing \r\n\r\nThis change has been tested on a live cluster with the Intel X520 NIC. The probe was able to capture and land roughly 1 gbps of raw packet data into Kafka.  The change was also tested in the Fastcapa test environment.\r\n\r\nTo test the change yourself, simply spin-up the virtualized test environment which will deploy and validate that Fastcapa can land packets in Kafka correctly.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment/vagrant/fastcapa-test-environment\r\nvagrant

Contributor Comments\r\nStellar does not currently contain short circuit operations. In most languages, this is an important optimization, but for Stellar on Metron, this is a requirement due to the fact that some variables may be null legitimately and we cannot create multi-line conditionals or temporary variables at the moment.\r\nThe short circuit operations supported:\r\n* short circuited `or` (e.g. `true or FUNC(...)` would never execute `FUNC`)\r\n* short circuited `and` (e.g. `false and FUNC(...)` would never execute `FUNC`)\r\n* short circuited if/then/else (e.g. `if true then FUNC(...) else FUNC2(...)` will never call `FUNC2`)\r\n\r\nThis should be tested entirely via the unit tests for Stellar.  Please review the tests and ensure I've not missed a test case, reviewers.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nFixed multiple problems in markdown docs, mostly related to triple-backtick codeblocks nesting inside numbered lists.  I now understand that blank lines are not allowed within a codeblock nested under a numbered list item, although at the top level (under body text) blank lines in codeblocks are okay.\r\n\r\nA few of these changes are for consistency or editorial improvement, but most of them fix actual rendering errors in the doxia site build, without breaking Github rendering.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis issue was discovered a while ago but a PR with a fix was never accepted.  In summary, the JoinBolt is acking the last tuple of a split message instead of the tuple containing the original message sent directly from the SplitBolt.  This is a problem because the tuple with the original message is anchored in the SplitBolt and the other tuples that go to enrichment bolts are not.\r\n\r\nThe major change in this PR involves storing the tuples in the cache instead of just the message.  This way the tuple from the SplitBolt can be retrieved and acked once all the parts have been received in the JoinBolt.  \r\n\r\nA couple other minor changes are also included.  I refactored the JoinBoltTest to make it easier to follow and maintain.  If anyone thinks this is worse than what we currently have I can revert that.  I also bumped up the default cache sizes for the JoinBolts from 10,000 to 100,000.  The low initial cache size was causing failures in full dev if I let it run for a while.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Prior to this, http:// was automatically prepended.  In the event that no protocol is given, http:// will be prepended for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added to ensure that the protocol is handled properly.

It also converts logging in metron-analytics, with the exception of MaaS which is currently leveraging commons logging.\r\n\r\nI've made a few types of changes (change varietals?).\r\n1. Normalized logger factory calls to the following `LoggerFactory.getLogger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());` , per https://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#declaration_pattern\r\n2. Removed `LOG.isDebugEnabled()` in instances where the SLF4J parameterized messages is a better option, e.g. `logger.debug(\"The entry is {}.\", entry);`. I have *not* changed this implementation in instances where more costly operations are being done, like string concatenation derived from parsing or serializing json into string form, per https://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance\r\n3. Replaced string concatenation with parameterized nessages. I did this even when a formatted string precedes an exception/throwable. The javadoc wasn't immediately clear about this, but as of SLF4J 1.6 a final exception argument will be treated as an exception rather than as an object for use during parameterization - https://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#paramException\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting instructions to follow. For starters, I've compared the number of lines in the Travis build output before and after this change and see no notable difference in total number of lines.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nDue to a bug in the storm-kafka-client in 1.1.0, offsets are not committed in the pcap topology. This can be worked around by ensuring that ack is called after nextTuple() rather than during nextTuple(). This is ONLY a problem in spout-only topologies (which self-ack).\r\n\r\nThe consequences here are that the pcap topology freezes multiple hours in whenever the max uncommitted offsets.\r\n\r\nThis is exercised testing-wise via the PCAP integration test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now the SyncPolicy works as follows:\r\n* If you specify the sync policy in the flux file, it will use that policy to determine when to sync the HDFS Writer.\r\n* If you do not, then it will create a count sync policy based on the batch size.\r\nIn the first case, we are not creating the sync policy properly and end up sync'ing per record, which has performance impact and is incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds logging for unexpected cache evictions in the JoinBolt.  More work still needs to be done to properly handle these failures (currently being discuss in the \"Enrichment Split/Join issues\" thread in the dev list) but this will at least report problems in the logs.  \r\n\r\nThis can be tested by setting the maxCacheSize or maxTimeRetain settings in the enrichment flux file to a low number and inspecting the logs.  Settings should be tested separately.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the PCAP topology is run against a Kafka topic with multiple partitions, there will be at least one file per partition. The current MR job only expects adding a left trailing file for a single partition, so we miss files when performing the filter by timestamp on the filenames and it ends up throwing an exception.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Part 1\r\n\r\nTo test this, run a pcap topology against a Kafka topic with multiple partitions, preferably 3 or more. You'll also want to set kafka.pcap.maxTimeMS to something like 5 minutes (300000). You'll need to install pycapa and run it to create some data - https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-sensors/pycapa. Let it run for 4-5 minutes. To keep it simple, stop it shy of 5 minutes so there's only 1 large-ish file per partition. \r\n\r\nRun pcap inspector on one of the files and make note of the starting and ending time. Pick a time in the middle and run a pcap query using that time, down to the minute, as a filter. e.g.\r\n`${METRON_HOME}/bin/pcap_query.sh query -df \"yyyyMMddHHmm\" -st 201705162000 --query \"\"`\r\n\r\nEDIT - also try this with a Kakfa partition name that includes underscores, e.g. `pcap_5`\r\n\r\n### Part 2\r\n\r\nRun a pcap query with a time outside of the range of times included in the pcap data and verify an exception is not thrown.\r\n\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/PCAP+CLI+Tool\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nI noticed there were some bugs rendering README.md files in GitHub MD, so I did a quick search by cloning the metron repo and then running `egrep -r \"^#{1,6}[a-zA-Z]\" * |

Contributor Comments\r\nMoving \"incubator-metron\" to \"metron\" everywhere other than the current-book directory.  Now that infra is setup everywhere, all links should work with just metron.  In addition, references to the incubator-metron directory are changed to metron (because a clean clone should result in a metron dir now).\r\n\r\nAt this point, it should only appear in the current-book.  If any of these should survive, let me know.\r\n\r\nI still need to run up full dev to validate, but I've opened the links manually and had them resolve.\r\n\r\nTo validate, make sure there aren't any incubator-metron instances leftover.  Ensure everything still builds and that the site-book looks good (other than anything derived from current-book).  Make sure the various links aren't broken. One Zeppelin dashboard (pcap) is effected by this, and to validate on full dev requires setting up per https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/559.\r\n\r\nAny other validation needs are welcome.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now, we do a sync per record written in HDFS. This has performance penalties as it requires a Namenode contact. We get around this by letting the user define the sync policy in Flux, but that's less convenient and more sensible defaults could be created. We should use the batch size as a sensible default for the sync policy (i.e. sync every batch).\r\n\r\nTesting plan pending\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now, changing the output of the kafka topic for the parsers involves either adjusting source code or adjusting parser configs in zookeeper.  It seems sensible to add the output topic to the CLI params as a convenience approach.\r\n\r\nTo test this, \r\n* Create a topic called `my_topic` in kafka\r\n* start up a parser topology of your choosing with `-ot my_topic`\r\n* feed data into it\r\n* use the console consumer to validate output is being piped into `my_topic`\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR makes it easier for someone with an existing bro install to send some of their log files into Metron, based off of a combination of the [bro documentation](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/script-reference/log-files.html) and a fresh install of bro 2.4.  There are future plans to expand on this via [METRON-518](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-518) and [METRON-908](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-908).  Specifically, this attempts to provide initial support the default-on fields of the following logs:\r\n - [Conn](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/conn/main.bro.html#type-Conn::Info)\r\n - [DPD](https://www.bro.org/sphinx-git/scripts/base/frameworks/dpd/main.bro.html#type-DPD::Info)\r\n - [FTP](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/ftp/info.bro.html#type-FTP::Info)\r\n - [Files](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/frameworks/files/main.bro.html#type-Files::Info)\r\n - [CertsInfo](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/policy/protocols/ssl/known-certs.bro.html#type-Known::CertsInfo)\r\n - [SMTP](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/smtp/main.bro.html#type-SMTP::Info)\r\n - [SSL](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/ssl/main.bro.html#type-SSL::Info)\r\n - [Weird](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/frameworks/notice/weird.bro.html#type-Weird::Info)\r\n - [Notice](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/frameworks/notice/main.bro.html#type-Notice::Info)\r\n - [DHCP](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/dhcp/main.bro.html#type-DHCP::Info)\r\n - [SSH](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/ssh/main.bro.html#type-SSH::Info)\r\n - [Software](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/frameworks/software/main.bro.html#type-Software::Info)\r\n - [Radius](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/radius/main.bro.html#type-RADIUS::Info)\r\n - [X509](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/files/x509/main.bro.html#type-X509::Info)\r\n - [DevicesInfo](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/policy/misc/known-devices.bro.html#type-Known::DevicesInfo)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThere are MAJOR performance issues with the storm-kafka-client. Throughput is roughly an order of magnitude faster in the 1.1.0 version vs the 1.0.3.\r\nThis also removes the requirement for the non-HDP profile to rely on the HDP repo.\r\n\r\nI will point out that the storm-kafka-client in 1.1 does rely on `Time.nanoTime()`, a method call that was introduced in 1.1.  To get around this, I've created the `metron-storm-kafka-override` with a backported implementation of the `Time` class.  This will be removed when we migrate to Storm 1.1.\r\n\r\nNormally, I would hold off this change until we take the effort to migrate to 1.1 properly, but the combination of empirical evidence (I saw it go an order of magnitude slower in 1.0.1 vs 1.1) and wide ranging change for Storm 1.1 makes me err on the side of getting this in faster.  It should help make every topology faster, but is in particular absolutely required to get sensible throughput in the pcap topology.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nReduced the level to WARN in service_advisor.py.\r\n\r\nSteps to validate:\r\n- Fire up Ambari wizard after installing Mpack\r\n- In the Assign Masters page, Metron REST should
