Fix test_ssh_client on big-endian architectures\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThe tests `test_consume_*_chunk_contains_no_utf8_character` are meant to ensure support for non-UTF-8 characters. To do so, we include UTF-32 characters and compare their binary representation after being fed to\r\nparamiko.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, UTF-32 is affected by the architecture's endianness, resulting in failed tests on big-endian architectures. In Ubuntu, it makes autopkgtest fail on the s390x platfgorm [1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n        chan.recv.side_effect = ['🤦'.encode('utf-32'), 'a', 'b']\r\n    \r\n        stdout = client._consume_stdout(chan).getvalue()\r\n>       self.assertEqual('\\x00\\x00&\\x01\\x00ab', stdout)\r\nE       AssertionError: '\\x00\\x00&\\x01\\x00ab' != '\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01&ab'\r\nE       -

tests/test_connection.py: fix test failing when https_proxy is set\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nIn tests/test_connection.py, We have code in setUp & tearDown functions to make tests run properly if the http_proxy variable is already present in the environment when running tests.\r\n\r\nFor each test, the code:\r\n* backs up the http_proxy variable (if it exists)\r\n* clears the environment variable\r\n* runs the test (sometimes the tests override the http_proxy variable; as in test_constructor)\r\n* restores the variable to its original value (or clears it is we didn't back up any value)\r\n\r\nHowever, we would also need to handle the HTTPS counterpart, the https_proxy variable. Running tests with this variable set currently fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n          self.assertIsNone(conn.proxy_scheme)\r\n    E       AssertionError: 'http' is not None\r\n\r\n    libcloud/test/test_connection.py:127: AssertionError\r\n```\r\nsome of Ubuntu's autopkgtest fail because of that.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the same logic that we have for HTTP, but for the HTTPS counterpart.\r\n\r\nTest case:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ https_proxy=http://squid.internal:3128 python3 -m pytest test/test_connection.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also removed the tearDownClass method that was clearing up the http_proxy variable unconditionally ; which could have side effects. We already have code that restores the http_proxy variable (or clear it) in the tearDown function so there is no need to do it twice.\r\n\r\n_EDIT: also added a similar mechanism for test/test_http.py where the client is expected to connect to the loopback interface. Proxies cannot proxy requests to to 127.0.0.1 so we backup and restore the http_proxy & https_proxy variables, just like we did for test/test_connection.py_\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nOlivier\r\n\r\n###

test/test_http.py: stop HTTP server (thread) properly\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThe `HttpLayerTestCase` test class creates a `HTTPServer` instance and runs it in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nAfter running all the test-cases, we attempt to close the server and the thread by killing the thread. Unfortunately, the code that does that is unreachable because the tear-down member function is called `tearDownCls` intead of `tearDownClass` [1].\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is no `threading.Thread.kill function`. This was undetected because the code was unreachable.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to clean things up is to:\r\n\r\n1. Stop the HTTP server using `HTTPServer.shutdown()`\r\n2. Join the thread using `threading.Thread.join()`\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[1] https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for

pull request updates paramiko SSH connection related code so it works with paramiko >= 2.9.0 and older OpenSSH server versions which don't support SHA-2 variants of the RSA key verification algorithm.\r\n\r\n## Background, Context\r\n\r\nParamiko v2.9.0 introduced a change which adds support and prefers SHA-2 variants of the RSA key verification algorithm (https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/2.9.0/sites/www/changelog.rst#changelog).\r\n\r\nThis change is backward incompatible and won't work it user tries to use paramiko >= 2.9.0 with older OpenSSH servers such as the default setup on Ubuntu 14.04.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Soluton\r\n\r\nIn this PR I introduced a change to fall back to the previous / old approach in case \"authentication error\" is throw when connecting to the server when running paramiko >= 2.9.0. Sadly there is no easy way to catch and retry only on more granular / specific exception.\r\n\r\nThis way the code works and supports older and newer versions of paramiko and OpenSSH servers.\r\n\r\n## Note on Security\r\n\r\nFor security reasons, if user knows they will only connect to new OpenSSH versions which support those variants + ``MSG_EXT_INFO`` extension, they are encouraged to disable this compatibility change by setting ``LIBCLOUD_PARAMIKO_SHA2_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY`` environment variable to ``false``.","created_at":"2022-05-06T22:06:05Z","updated_at":"2022-09-25T14:44:45Z","closed_at":"2022-05-14T10:24:18Z","merged_at":"2022-05-14T10:24:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"003040bbcbd3993ccae6e2a45b2da0c5aae9a1dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383433,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzNDMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute","name":"api:

Enable retrying of raw requests parse_error\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe are currently again running into some errors again unfortunately when using libcloud and the storage buckets scaling up/returning 500s under load.\r\n\r\nHow does this fix retrying? The RawResponse now ALSO parses the error as the base Response class does. At best we would actually call the super init in the RawResponse class, but that is not possible due to the overriding of mutable properties with computed ones, I might look into that some other time.\r\n\r\nSince the actual error is only thrown on `parse_error` calls and that method was before never called for raw responses in the retry loop, this will now be caught and retriggered.\r\n\r\nImho this makes the flow clearer anyways  since it's the same for both Response types, and removes the \"duplicate\" error parsing in the case of a non-raw-response.\r\n\r\n###

Add paginated request method to GCEConnection\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSource issues:\r\n- #1646\r\n\r\nThe problem is not only related with images.\r\nIn many API call there is no pagination management, so when the number of results is over the default maxResults value (500) the same problem will appear.\r\nIn this PR I have added a new paginated_request function to the GCEConnection class and use it in the list_images function to solve #1646. But other calls to simple \"request\" call may be replaced with the same function.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nReplace this: describe the PR status.

Create Azure node from Compute Gallery image, OS disk delete\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSource issues:\r\n- #1643\r\n- #1644\r\n\r\n[Azure Compute Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries) is the recommended way to create custom images for Azure VMs. Supporting these works just like the `AzureImage` in libcloud today except you provide a single `id` under `imageReference` (instead of multiple key/values). See this [example request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtual-machines/create-or-update#create-a-vm-from-a-custom-image) and the [corresponding spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtual-machines/create-or-update#imagereference). \r\n\r\nAzure VM OS disks can be configured at the time of VM creation to be deleted when the VM is deleted. It would be helpful if libcloud supported this option. There is not an option in libcloud to do this on delete and it is convenient in some use cases to delete the disk regardless of the method (CLI, portal, libcloud, etc.). Supporting this requires a `deleteOption` of `Delete` under `OSDisk` when creating a VM. See the [OSDisk spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtual-machines/create-or-update#osdisk) for details. \r\n\r\nA newer `api-version` is required for `create_node` (`deleteOption` not accepted otherwise).\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone, ready for review. \r\n\r\nThe need to change the `api-version` for the Azure create node API may be problematic. I have tested `deleteOption` with Azure VMs using Compute Gallery Images with user code. I have added simple tests as well.\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide)

pull request fixes object name prefix based filtering which was accidentally broken by the change in #1584.\r\n\r\nIt was reported by a user (https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1584#issuecomment-983712951), that the change breaks the behavior.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that myself by adding a test case which was failing with changes from #1584, but should pass if the behavior was correct - prefix based filtering is based on the object name and not on sub-directory names so optimization from #1584 is not a good idea (it's true though that in some cases, bucket / sub-directory name is part of the object name, but that's an implementation detail).\r\n\r\nIt achieves that by reverting changes from #1584.\r\n\r\nSadly we didn't have good existing tests which would have caught this issue early, but I added some regression tests to help us in the future.","created_at":"2021-12-01T17:41:25Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T08:52:26Z","closed_at":"2021-12-02T20:46:08Z","merged_at":"2021-12-02T20:46:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"97a417d6c762c2cefc16d74c79243eba7db2721a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzMjc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/bug%20fix","name":"bug

pull request should help with an edge case / issue reported in #1591.\r\n\r\n## Background, context\r\n\r\nRight now if retrying failed HTTP requests is enabled globally (either via module level constant or via environment variable value), Libcloud will also try to retry a request inside ``_is_gce()`` on driver instantiation / authentication where we try to determine if GCE metadata server is available and what kind of auth credentials are provided by the user.\r\n\r\nThis is not desired when GCE metadata server is not available and a different type of credentials are used (e.g. oAuth 2).\r\n\r\n## Proposed Approach\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I simply disable retrying failed requests for that code piece where we determine if metadata server is available.\r\n\r\nI think this should be sufficient, but if needed / desired, we can add another argument to the driver constructor which would cause driver to skip this step all together (e.g. ``ex_don_check_gce_metadata_server``).\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Unit

Fix right path composition suited for destination machine\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen running libcloud on Windows to deploy a linux machine in the cloud with a ScriptDeployment, it had always promted me an error which was like \"stderr: bash: /home/googlelibcloud_deployment_b20d6e1e.sh: No such file or directory\". So, the path was not right formatted. The error was in the os.path.join method, which produces a false path on windows like \"/home/google\\\\libcloud_deployment_b20d6e1e.sh\". So I had to add the .replace(\"\\\\\",\"/\") method to the os.path.join.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

EC2: Add support for gp3 and io2 volumes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe ec2 driver currently supports `standard`, `io1`, `gp2`, `st1` and `sc1` volume types. This change adds support for `gp3` and `io2` volume types. The driver currently maintains a list of volume types and raises a `ValueError` if an unsupported volume type is passed. The solution is to simply add the new types to this list. This change also enhances the `create_volume` unit test to verify that a `ValueError` is raised for a volume type that is not in the list.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n###

Together with #1588 (for which we have a workaround), this would solve our issue completely and we could keep using libcloud.\r\n\r\nI only added a call to retrying the raw requests.\r\n\r\n###

Retry logic customization\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe old implementation of retrying is fixed for all connection classes and is not customizable.\r\nFor example the exception types that are retried are not available as a parameter from within the connection, so\r\nyou had to live with what the default value is.\r\nUnfortunately, that is not always enough, e.g. for S3 storage you can [receive 503 Slow Down Responses](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-troubleshoot-503-cross-region/) that should be retried with exponential back-off. Google Storage also has a similar mechanism.\r\nThese errors lead to exceptions at the moment.\r\n\r\nThis pull request takes a *first step* in fixing this by making the retry logic explicitly configurable within the connection.\r\n\r\nIf you deem this reasonable we can make the change to retry S3 slow down requests.\r\nThis requires differentiating HTTP exceptions by their status code, similar to what is mentioned in #1577.\r\n\r\nIn case you do not want to add more exceptions to retry, this change here would still enable end-users to customize the behavior without major hacks:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom libcloud.utils.retry import MinimalRetry\r\n\r\nclass MyFancyRetry(MinimalRetry):\r\n\r\n    def should_retry(self, exception):\r\n        retry = ...  # some logic\r\n        return retry\r\n\r\n\r\ndriver = get_driver(Provider.SOME_PROVIDER)(...)\r\ndriver.connection.retryCls = MyFancyRetry\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried my best to be fully backward compatible and no actual behavior is changed yet.\r\nIf you are open to breaking changes we could also think about using urllib.Retry as suggested in #1577, and/or unifying the retry parameters that are passed around into some parameter class.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone, but could be extended with some feedback\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks) (done via commit hook)\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [x]

Add integration tests for S3 storage driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds integration tests for the S3 storage driver.\r\n\r\nGiven that there are existing buckets in the test AWS account, this pull request also updates the base tests to ignore any containers that weren't created as part of the test.\r\n\r\nUnlike for Azure and MinIO, on S3, `create_container` for an already existing container seems to not throw `ContainerAlreadyExistsError` so the assertion has been disabled in this driver's test suite.

Add integration tests for Azure Storage driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1553#discussion_r572431845, this pull request ports the Azure Storage driver integration tests from [libcloud-tests](https://github.com/c-w/libcloud-tests) to trunk.\r\n\r\nThe tests are split into a generic storage integration test base (which uses the high level storage driver API to run various scenarios) and specific instantiations which exercise various Azure Storage backends. The intent is that the test base in the future can be re-used to quickly add integration tests for other storage backends.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Transient errors with the Azure Ubuntu package mirrors required adding a call to `apt-get update` to fix the CI, similar to what's described in https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/675.\r\n- The new storage integration have been added as a new tox target to avoid slowing down the unit test suite, re-using some existing patterns laid out by integration tests of the compute API.\r\n- ~~While libcloud-tests ran against containerized and cloud-based storage accounts, for now this pull request only ports the former as I will soon loose access to my free cloud credits. However, if someone wants to add me to an Azure subscription that is funded for this project, or provide me with the credentials for a service principal, I'm more than happy to add the required code to run the test suite against the live cloud storage backends.~~\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Updates on  CloudSigma driver\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- Add all supported regions\r\n- Use example sizes  currently provided by CloudSigma\r\n- Change methods parameters to use actual  cores to define CPUs instead of MHz\r\n- Change Drive methods parameters to use GBs instead of bytes\r\n- Implement SSH key related methods ( `list_key_pairs`, `get_key_pair`, `create_key_pair`, `import_key_pair_from_string`, `delete_key_pair`), add ssh keys param on `create_node` \r\n- Implement `ex_attach_drive`, `ex_detach_drive`, `ex_destroy_drive`, `reboot_node`, `ex_get_node`\r\n- Make deleting all attached drives on `destroy_node` optional\r\n- Add tests on methods added\r\n- Add volume methods which call the appropriate ex_drive method ( since CloudSigma drives are pretty much volumes in the context of libcloud, I thought this makes sense)\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

When a new token is acquired from OpenStack, it is inserted into the cache for later reuse.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a token is revoked, causing a 401 Unauthorized response while using it, that token is removed from the cache to prevent future uses.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Respect common HTTP headers when uploading Azure Storage blob via stream\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1550\r\n\r\nAs per the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-list#request-headers), when uploading an object via stream to Azure Storage, common HTTP headers (e.g. `Content-Encoding`) must be provided via an Azure-specific name (e.g. `x-ms-blob-content-encoding`). The driver was previously ignoring user-provided headers when uploading objects via stream and wasn't adapting the header names to their Azure-specific equivalent, which are both issues fixed by this pull request.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Add support for Azure Government to Azure Blobs storage driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds support to the Azure Blobs storage driver for deployments of Azure Storage that use custom hostnames such as Azure Government, Azure China, and Azure Private Link. To target these deployments, the driver can be initialized as follows:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.types import Provider\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.providers import get_driver\r\n\r\ncls = get_driver(Provider.AZURE_BLOBS)\r\n\r\nhost = 'privatelink.blob.core.windows.net'  # for Azure Private Link\r\nhost = 'blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn'  # for Azure China\r\nhost = 'blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net'  # for Azure Government\r\n\r\ndriver = cls(key='your storage account name',\r\n             secret='your access key',\r\n             host=host)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change maintains backwards compatibility with the previous approach of using a custom host argument to target Azurite or IoT Edge Storage by explicitly checking for the Azure China, Azure Government, and Azure Private Link well-known endpoint constants.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1551\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x]

pull request fixes EC2 driver related authentication regression / bug which was inadvertently introduced in v3.3.0, originally reported in #1545 .\r\n\r\n## Background, Context\r\n\r\n#1519 introduced a bug which would cause EC2 driver to always use signature version 2 for authentication.\r\n\r\nThis won't work with some newer regions which require signature version 4.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes that and also adds a change which allows user to explicitly specify / override which signature version to use for authentication by passing ``signature_version`` argument to the driver constructor.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to @olegrtecno for reporting this issue.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Changelog entry\r\n- [x] Add a release note entry on potential

see, the ttl is never stored in the `extra` dict, so this if statement is always false, and the zone default TTL is always picked, even in case the Record does have a more specific TTL.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- work in progress, tests are failing. My bad.\r\n- ~done, ready for review~\r\n- may need additional unit test\r\n\r\n### Classification\r\n\r\nSuggested labels: `bug fix`, `api: dns`\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [X] Documentation (existing documentation suffices, this is only a small bug fix)\r\n- [ ] [Tests](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing.html)\r\n- [ ] [ICLA](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#contributing-bigger-changes) (required for bigger

pull request adds a workaround / fix for the issue reported in #1529.\r\n\r\n## Background, Context\r\n\r\nIt appears that in the past Libcloud supported URL paths with double slashes (e.g. ``/my-bucket/foo//1.txt``), but once moving to requests we added some code for path sanitization so we don't support that use case anymore.\r\n\r\nIt appears that change was originally added in - fedace00261bcbb0a45bda003b968101a897d4ed.\r\n\r\nFrom technical perspective, I think it should be fine to support double slashes since that's usually handled / stripped on the server side (e.g. either inside the web server or inside the app), but I'm sure there was a valid reason for that change - with so many providers we support we've seen all kind of weird API issues and implementation so I assume that change was added to guard against such issues.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Fix / Solution\r\n\r\nI tried a couple of things as a possible fix / workaround.\r\n\r\nIt seems like that doing no path sanitization brakes a whole lot of other things so in the end I decided to go with a module level variable which can be changed by the user.\r\n\r\nThis should be much safer change since it won't affect anyone but users who explicitly opt-in.\r\n\r\nI've done some testing and it appears to be working correctly end to end, but there could potentially still be edge cases hiding in the other parts of the code base.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Upgrade notes entry\r\n- [x] Documentation entry (S3 driver)\r\n\r\nResolves

Bug fix: raise proper exception when using incorrect credentials for AuroraDNS\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a minor fix for a bug that was introduced in january 2016. See #1521 for details.\r\n\r\n#### Code to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n\r\nfrom libcloud.dns.types import Provider\r\nfrom libcloud.dns.providers import get_driver\r\n\r\napi_key = '123456'\r\nsecret_key = 'this_is_the_wrong_password'\r\n\r\ncls = get_driver(Provider.AURORADNS)\r\ndriver = cls(api_key, secret_key)\r\n\r\nfor zone in driver.iterate_zones():\r\n    print(zone)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected exception:\r\n\r\nThis should have raised an `ProviderError: Authorization failed`\r\n\r\n#### Actual exception:\r\n\r\n`TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'http_status'`\r\n\r\n### Source of the bug:\r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced in commit de7862f, which includes the following rewrite:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-            raise ProviderError(value='Authorization failed', http_code=status,\r\n-                                driver=self)\r\n+            error['value'] = 'Authorization failed'\r\n+            error['http_status'] = status\r\n+            raise ProviderError(**error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the intention is clear, the author inadvertently changed the way `ProviderError` was called from `ProviderError(value=..., http_code=status)` to `ProviderError(value=..., http_status=status)`\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this bug by changing the line `error['http_status'] = status` to `error['http_code'] = status`\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [X] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [X] Documentation\r\n- [ ]

pull request updates EC2 driver and moves all the various constants from ``libcloud/compute/constants.py`` module into three different files / modules in ``libcloud/compute/constants/`` directory / package.\r\n\r\nOnly the relatively small ``ec2_region_details_partial`` module is imported directly when importing EC2 driver module.\r\n\r\nOther two modules are imported lazily when needed (aka when calling ``list_sizes()`` methods).\r\n\r\n## Background, Context\r\n\r\nI was doing some import time and memory profiling and noticed that importing some of that Libcloud modules is relatively small and also has relatively large memory footprint.\r\n\r\nAfter digging in, I found that one of the main culprits was ``libcloud.compute.constants`` module.\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\nI also removed existing ``libcloud/compute/constants.py`` file. If someone feels strongly about it, I can leave it in place for a while longer for backward compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that this module also had a bad name since it only contained EC2 related constant and that was not obvious from the module name.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Add some tests and instrumentation which ensures we don't (accidentally) introduce slow or large imports\r\n- [x] Also optimizing pricing data import and caching - only import and cache pricing data for the requested provider and not for all the providers","created_at":"2020-11-07T21:15:40Z","updated_at":"2020-12-06T13:48:01Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T13:48:01Z","merged_at":"2020-12-06T13:48:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"2df4a8a4707eed3030be6250cfd04bd732629038","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383433,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzNDMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute","name":"api: compute","color":"ffbac7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1430953003,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDMwOTUzMDAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/drivers:%20ec2","name":"drivers: ec2","color":"edbca6","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2173636436,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTczNjM2NDM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/pricing%20data","name":"pricing data","color":"ed0ef4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1519/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1519/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1519/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/248e343b736e1d5d13eccdc2b84a9993e0015c5e","head":{"label":"Kami:optimize_ec2_driver_imports","ref":"optimize_ec2_driver_imports","sha":"248e343b736e1d5d13eccdc2b84a9993e0015c5e","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.
