There are a few others just like this including:\r\n\r\n- reading the eventId part\r\n- reading the key part\r\n- reading the callbackArg part\r\n- reading the regionName part\r\n\r\nThese all currently log and throw which will cause the event to be returned to the caller and dropped. Maybe I need to put the retry logic around the entire switch statement instead of within each case?
