Changed tests because they run validation after the run and need to block until completion. We may revert the changes in examples. I converted the because in the instructions we directed users to blocking runners before and this change keeps the behavior same.\r\n\r\nI have started a local post commit run (not completed yet) and it was successful with the first few tests so far and the changes are same for all tests.\r\n\r\nRemaining work after this PR:\r\n- Removing BlockingDataflowRunner.

this update Python BoundedSource/RangeTracker API can report consumed and remaining number of split points while performing a source read operations.
