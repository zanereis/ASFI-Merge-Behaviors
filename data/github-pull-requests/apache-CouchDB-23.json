Overview\r\n\r\nIn situations where the chttpd authenticaion db (usually named \"_users\")\r\ndoes not get created, or gets deleted, the auth cache still attempts\r\nto start the change listener, which results in notice and error level\r\nlogs in the system like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[notice] 2018-12-03T22:04:44.299392Z node1@127.0.0.1 <0.374.0> -------- chttpd_auth_cache changes listener died

run `./configure` again and make sure it doesn't try to install `emilio` again\r\n- Update any erlang files in any dependency (except files mentioned in `ignore` section of `emilio.config`)\r\n- Run `make emilio` and make sure that:\r\n  - produced warnings are only for (± 3) updated lines\r\n  - make fails with non 0 exit code  \r\n- Run `bin/emilio -c emilio.config src | bin/warnings_in_scope -s 0` to see warnings from `emilio`\r\n  - make sure produced warnings are only for updated lines\r\n- Run `bin/emilio -c emilio.config src` and make sure dependencies mentioned in `ignore` section of

PR implements shard splitting [1] for CouchDB as discussed in RFC #1920.\r\n\r\nThe work is organized as a series of commits in the following order:\r\n\r\n* Uneven shard copy handling in mem3 and fabric. That's a preparatory step to\r\n  make sure mem3 and fabric knows how to handle uneven shard copies on the\r\n  cluster.\r\n\r\n* Main job manager and supervisor. This commit defines the supervision tree and\r\n  the main job manager. The job manager is a central component which starts,\r\n  stops and monitors jobs.\r\n\r\n* Individual shard splitting job implementation and associated helper module.\r\n  Here the logic for a single shard splitting job is defined along with the\r\n  needed helpers, some of which were separated in different modules. The\r\n  couch_db_split module, specifically is in its own commit as it lives in the\r\n  `couch` application, operates on db files (instead of shards) and general is\r\n  large and separate enough from the rest to warrant its own commit.\r\n\r\n* Internal replicator update to handle split shards. Internal replicator and\r\n  some associated helpers in mem3_rep were updated to handle split shard\r\n  sources and targets. Internal replicator involved in resharding in two main\r\n  ways 1) during the normal cluster operation replicating between possibly\r\n  split shards and 2) as part of the shard splitting job logic where it is used\r\n  to topoff updates from the source to the targets.\r\n\r\n* HTTP API implementation and functional tests. This commit implements the HTTP\r\n  API and adds behavior and other tests as discussed in the RFC.\r\n\r\n[1] Shard splitting and resharding is used interchangeably in the PR and the\r\ncommits. Initially the work had started with implementing just shard splitting\r\nand the API reflected that, however after a fruitful discussion in the couchdb\r\ndev mailing list, it was agreed to generalize the work to potentially allow\r\nshard merging or other shard map operations in the future. So closer to the\r\nHTTP API level \"resharding\" will be used more often and in the job\r\nimplementation discussions and comments shard splitting will be used, since\r\ncurrently only shard splitting is supported.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-15T23:14:14Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T04:56:37Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T04:56:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52bcc47bd57ee403865758579cd91b02b30d8497","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1921/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1921/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1921/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/6092cffce39e8b58134a6a7c5ee77675232d68ba","head":{"label":"apache:shard-split","ref":"shard-split","sha":"6092cffce39e8b58134a6a7c5ee77675232d68ba","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

used to address issue https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/969 (GET /db/_all_docs?update_seq=true missing 'offset' and 'update_seq' when 'keys' also provided).\r\n\r\nRecently, new issue

tale of strings, bytes and pyhon3, I guess. This is probably the first line of python I've written in my life. Hooray! 😀 I consulted this fun [document](https://docs.python.org/release/3.0.1/whatsnew/3.0.html#text-vs-data-instead-of-unicode-vs-8-bit) to understand what's going on.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n`couchup` crashed in python3, because `base64.b64encode` expects a bytes-like object instead of a string. With this PR the string passed to `base64.b64encode` is properly encoded and decoded.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun couchup with credentials with python3:\r\n`couchup replicate -a --login admin --password <my-password>`\r\n\r\nI was able to run couchup successfully on my DB with the change applied.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nfixes

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis work-in-progress PR tracks my efforts to implement features described in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1554 namely Mango-based update handlers under the `/{db}/_update` endpoint.\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, I have scaffolded only a few functions and have written no tests. I'm mainly fumbling around, copying code from where it seems to make sense, in anticipation of further guidance.\r\n\r\nAs described in the issue thread, this PR attempts to implement the following endpoints:\r\n- `GET /{db/_update`: Retrieve a database's update handlers, similar to `GET /{db}/_index`.\r\n- `POST /{db}/_update`: Submit a document for validation. If it passes validation, the update is accepted. Otherwise, it is rejected.\r\n- `PUT /{db}/_update`: Create a new update handler.\r\n- `DELETE /{db}/_update`: Delete an update handler.\r\n\r\nAlthough not yet in the code, I expect update handlers to have at least two attributes: a `guard` selector, which indicates which documents this handler applies to; and a `condition` selector, which validates the document. If a document passes the `guard` selector but not the `condition` selector, it is rejected. If a document submitted for validation matches no known guard selectors, it should be rejected too.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, there are no tests in this PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1554\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple

Overview\r\n\r\nJenkins - and local runs - are failing on `make check` and `make elixir` because `mix` has not yet been set up, and deps have not been installed.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `elixir-init` target that runs at the start of `make elixir` to do all the necessary setup work.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n`make check` on a fresh checkout of CouchDB, on a user account that's never run `mix` or `elixir` before.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n-

are experiencing an issue similar to #1579, partly because we have\r\ndozens of thousands of databases.\r\n\r\nOn our servers:\r\n- `snooze_period = 0` leads to a significant CPU load,\r\n- `snooze_period = 1` is too long for compaction to finish within 20\r\n  hours (after 20 hours, compaction is stopped to allow other\r\n  CPU-intensive processes to run, and when compaction restarts, it does\r\n  not pick up where it left 4 hours earlier -- by the way proposal at\r\n  #1775 would be really great to fix that!)\r\n\r\nThis commits allows to write `snooze_period = 0.3` in

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

couchup script was not running if using python2, missing the quote from urllib\r\n\r\nAccording to the python3 docuymentation:\r\n\r\n>  The urllib module has been split into parts and renamed in Python 3 to urllib.request, urllib.parse, and urllib.error. \r\n\r\nAt the couchup script, the 2 alternatives at lines 22 and 24 are both importing the python3 alternative.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTo test is just run the script on python2 before and after the change, because the error its just the import statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-21T00:48:19Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T02:32:32Z","closed_at":"2019-01-21T02:32:32Z","merged_at":"2019-01-21T02:32:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfb98104ffd8035b23cabf3b597d68bd91f51b4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/4d9a1753234e620c173d2214e5b3a7afcee3dcac","head":{"label":"pealthoff:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"4d9a1753234e620c173d2214e5b3a7afcee3dcac","user":{"login":"pealthoff","id":4707333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDczMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4707333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff","html_url":"https://github.com/pealthoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166725474,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjY3MjU0NzQ=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"pealthoff/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pealthoff","id":4707333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDczMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4707333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff","html_url":"https://github.com/pealthoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pealthoff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pealthoff/couchdb","description":"Apache

was a subtle bug when opening specific revisions in\r\nfabric_doc_open_revs due to a race condition between updates being\r\napplied across a cluster.\r\n\r\nThe underlying cause here was due to the stemming after a document had\r\nbeen updated more than revs_limit number of times along with concurrent\r\nreads to a node that had not yet made the update. To illustrate lets\r\nconsider a document A which has a revision history from `{N, RevN}` to\r\n`{N+1000, RevN+1000}` (assuming revs_limit is the default 1000). If we\r\nconsider a single node perspective when an update comes in we added the\r\nnew revision and stem the oldest revision. The docs the revisions on the\r\nnode would be `{N+1, RevN+1}` to `{N+1001, RevN+1001}`.\r\n\r\nThe bug exists when we attempt to open revisions on a different node\r\nthat has yet to apply the new update. In this case when\r\nfabric_doc_open_revs could be called with `{N+1000, RevN+1000}`. This\r\nresults in a response from fabric_doc_open_revs that includes two\r\ndifferent `{ok, Doc}` results instead of the expected one instance. The\r\nreason for this is that one document has revisions `{N+1, RevN+1}` to\r\n`{N+1000, RevN+1000}` from the node that has applied the update, while\r\nthe node without the update responds with revisions `{N, RevN}` to\r\n{N+1000, RevN+1000}`.\r\n\r\nTo rephrase that, a node that has applied an update can end up returning\r\na revision path that contains `revs_limit - 1` revisions while a node\r\nwihtout the update returns all `revs_limit` revisions. This slight\r\nchange in the path prevented the responses from being properly combined\r\ninto a single response.\r\n\r\nThis bug has existed for many years. However, read repair effectively\r\nprevents it from being a significant issue by immediately fixing the\r\nrevision history discrepancy. This was discovered due to the recent bug\r\nin read repair during a mixed cluster upgrade to a release including\r\nclustered purge. In this situation we end up crashing the design\r\ndocument cache which then leads to all of the design document requests\r\nbeing direct reads which can end up causing cluster nodes to OOM and\r\ndie. The conditions require a significant number of design document\r\nedits coupled with already significant load to those modified design\r\ndocuments. The most direct example observed was a clustered that had a\r\nsignificant number of filtered replications in and out of the cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

It also removes platform defines and ifdefs necessary to compile using earlier versions.\r\n\r\nThe main benefits are speeding up Travis by not having to run tests against two platforms, and simplifying some code, making it easier to reason about and maintain.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better.

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Disable the VDU in _users database (I removed the validate function)\r\n2. Set the log level to Debug\r\n3. Add an valid user without an id (let Couch generate one)\r\n4. Replicate the user database to another database to trigger the changes_callback function.\r\n5. You should see the debug level saying that the id is invalid and the cache reader should not throw a function clause. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any

Overview\r\n\r\nI noticed that `couch_replicator_manager` has one foot out the door, and thought I'd try and finish it off.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI'll build a full database Erlang release and trigger replication integration tests specifically. This change doesn't reduce test coverage although we remove a line from a module-loading test pertaining to `couch_replicator_manager`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nNone

The tests to be executed in each quorum condition is selected by using elixir module tags.\r\n\r\n```@moduletag :with_quorum_test``` and ```@moduletag :without_quorum_test``` are excluded from the current elixir test suite and are only considered by the associated makefile task.\r\n\r\nAny other test that requires to consider cluster quorum conditions can be included by using these tags  \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\nUse the corresponding

Overview\r\n\r\nThis server admin-only endpoint forces an n-way sync of all shards\r\nacross all nodes on which they are hosted.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful for an administrator adding a new node to the\r\ncluster, after updating _dbs so that the new node hosts an existing db\r\nwith content, to force the new node to sync all of that db's shards.\r\n\r\nUsers may want to bump their `[mem3] sync_concurrency` value to a\r\nlarger figure for the duration of the shards sync.\r\n\r\nCloses #1807\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTesting this requires a non-standard setup, so I have

Overview\r\n\r\nThe problem was introduced in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/94eff0d8ddcdb552389b4273f771aba211e4e57c during rebase of https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1774\r\nThe location of generated config file is `os.path.join(ctx[\"devdir\"], \"lib\", \"haproxy.cfg\")` (see https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/94eff0d8ddcdb552389b4273f771aba211e4e57c#diff-d86563699bde00df2cce2613ecbed531R281). We attempt to start haproxy with config located at `os.path.join(ctx[\"devdir\"], \"rel\", \"haproxy.cfg\")` (see https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/94eff0d8ddcdb552389b4273f771aba211e4e57c#diff-d86563699bde00df2cce2613ecbed531R384). Which is obviously incorrect since we suppose to use generated config file.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun `dev/run --with-haproxy` and make sure haproxy process is running\r\n\r\n##

The dependent applications are included in .app.src files, and it appears that the callbacks are implemented correctly. Any help figuring these out would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb-ets-lru/pull/7\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple

Overview\r\n\r\nImplementation of eunit tests in the same module with the code we are trying to test is not a good idea. The test suites in the module are conditionally compiled using `-ifdef(TEST).`. This means that depending on phase of the moon the tests can be skipped. They are certainly skipped when `eunit` is used in combination with `meck` library. This problem manifested itself in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1754 where the tests were originally introduced. The PR was merged because Travis was green and it had a `+1`. However close look at test logs (https://travis-ci.org/apache/couchdb/builds/458820868?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification) on Travis reveal that the tests didn't run (search for couch_flags_config):\r\n```\r\nmodule 'couch_bt_engine_stream'\r\nmodule 'couch_flags_config'\r\nmodule 'couch_changes'\r\n  module 'couch_changes_tests'\r\n    Changes feed\r\n      Filter _selector\r\n        couch_changes_tests:368: should_select_basic...[0.055 s] ok\r\n        couch_changes_tests:382: should_select_with_since...[0.001 s] ok\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe only correct solution is to move tests into a suite in `test` directory. In this case compilation will be unconditional so the tests wouldn't be skipped.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the tests and updates the expected return value so the test pass.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Run `make eunit > eunit.log` without reducing the scope of testing (using apps= or tests=).\r\n2. Consult `eunit.log` to see if tests for couch_flags_config has been run.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1754\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new feature, user-defined partitioned databases.\r\n\r\nA new kind of database can be created with the ?partitioned=true option. All documents within the database must have document ids of the following format;\r\n\r\npartition_name:doc_id\r\n\r\nboth partition_name and doc_id must follow the couchdb id format (can't begin with _, etc).\r\n\r\nAll documents with the same partition_name are guaranteed to be mapped to the same shard range. When querying an index, the new /db/_partition/$partition/_view endpoint can query the view more efficiently, by only consulting the single shard range holding the partition. This is much more efficient and scales the same way that primary key lookup (GET /dbname/docid) does (approximately linearly).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe PR contains multiple tests for basic functionality and all existing tests still pass. When testing the PR, it is important to try the feature yourself, interactively, with docs and views of your choosing, to give us confidence in this new feature.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThis supersedes PR #1605.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nMango text indexes currently throw function clauses when queries in two\r\nsituations:\r\n\r\n1) Empty Selector\r\n2) Operators with empty arrays.\r\n\r\nWe fix this issue and change the behavior as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Any empty selector will fall back on _all_docs (like json indexes).\r\n2) $or, $and, $in, $all that specify an empty arrays\r\nwill be treated as no-op when combined with other operators.\r\n3) A single no-nop query such as {\"$or\": []} will not be executed and\r\nreturn nothing just like json indexes.\r\n4) $nin with an empty array will return all docs that match the field,\r\njust like json indexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nNew tests were added to the python suite and can be run with\r\nMANGO_TEXT_INDEXES=1 nosetests test/21-empty-selector-tests.py\r\n\r\nThis requires a clouseau setup. \r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThe issue is this PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and

by our formatting work on [Elixir](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1769), this PR proposes doing the same thing for our Python code.\r\n\r\n[Python Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) is an opinionated code formatter now adopted by prominent Python projects such as `pip`. It is easy to use and provides both formatting and check modes.\r\n\r\nThe `python-black` target builds a python3 venv at .venv and installs black if possible. Since black is Python 3.6 and up only, we skip the check on systems with an older Python 3.x and print a warning. Our CI systems will still catch problems from people who submit PRs who don't have 3.6+ since CI is  configured to run this check automatically on at least one platform (e.g., Jenkins Ubuntu Bionic, or Python 3.6 explicitly requested under Travis CI.)\r\n\r\nAssuming the check runs, it fails if any file would be changed by the formatter.\r\n\r\nA Makefile target is provided that actually _does_ the updating (`make python-black-update`, it simply omits the `--check` flag) for happy dev fingers to fix up python files.\r\n\r\nThe change to the `docs` dependency in `rebar.config.script` is necessary because of embedded Python files in that repo that have only just been re-formatted. Once docs is tagged with 2.3.0, this dep will be reverted to a tag-type reference, not a commit.\r\n\r\n@nickva I had to change the location of the Mango venv to `src/mango/.venv` so it would be automatically ignored by the formatter, otherwise it tries to format the entire venv. Oops :)\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nIf you have Python 3.6+, try `make python-black` and see if it works.\r\n\r\nif you don't, try the same command and make sure it is a noop (with an exit code of 0).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [X] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nAdd support for dev cluster with more than 3 nodes. Even though we have `-n <N>` option for `dev/run` it has a couple of limitations.\r\n- The number of nodes cannot be more than 5. Otherwise we try to allocate tcp ports greater than  65535\r\n- The number of nodes is assumed to be 3 in couple of places\r\n  - [in setup application](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/setup/src/setup.erl#L289:L294)\r\n  - [in haproxy config](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/rel/haproxy.cfg)\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the limitation and adds `--auto-ports` which we are planing to use to run Elixir test suite. So we can instantiate a second instance of the cluster specifically for test suite.\r\n \r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n### Testing `--auto-ports` option\r\n\r\n1. clean development environment `rm -rf dev/lib`\r\n2. run cluster as follows `dev/run --admin=adm:pass --auto-ports` (**note the port number of the cluster**)\r\n  - verify that logs printed on console use random ports for nodes \r\n3. let it start and call `_membership` endpoint (use the port noted in step 2)\r\n4. (optional): remsh into cluster and run `mem3:nodes()`\r\n\r\n### Testing more than 3 nodes\r\n\r\n1. clean development environment `rm -rf dev/lib`\r\n2. run cluster as follows `dev/run --admin=adm:pass -n 10` (**note the port number of the cluster**)\r\n  - verify that logs printed on console use random ports for nodes starting from 4th node\r\n3. let it start and call `_membership` endpoint (use port noted in step 2)\r\n  - verify that there are 10 nodes returned\r\n4. (optional): remsh into cluster and run `mem3:nodes()`\r\n \r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by
