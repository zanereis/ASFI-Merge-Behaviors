SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a severe issue for which changes in the properties modal of a Dashboard won't be fully saved when the `onlyApply` prop was used. This PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17392 enabled the `onlyApply` tag. Later, manual tests have shown that the tag wasn't ready to be used as both the frontend and the backend were not fully implemented for that to work properly. In addition to that, this PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Refactors the `PropertiesModal` to use typescript\r\n- Refactors the `form` component to use the functionalities provided by Antdesign\r\n- Fixes an issue in the Dashboard detail page for which when applying changes and re-opening the properties modal it did not show the latest changes \r\n- Fixes an issue for which changes in the `json_metadata` for `color_namespace`, `expanded_slices`, `timed_refresh_immune_slices` were not saved \r\n- Fixes an issue for which the dashboard wasn't redirecting back to the original URL when the _slug_ was deleted\r\n- Fixes an issue for which changes to native filters would not update the json_metadata immediately, causing potential overwrites\r\n- Changes the endpoint that was used for updating the dashboard (`save_dash`) with the standard PUT endpoint. Also, it adds the `set_dash_metadata` function to the `update` command in the backend. The `set_dash_metadata` function was only used by the `save_dash` endpoint before, causing potential discrepancies in the way the `json_metatada` was handled by the standard PUT endpoint.\r\n- Removes unnecessary fetch requests\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a Dashboard\r\n2. Edit the properties, including the json metadata\r\n3. Apply the changes\r\n4. Reopen the modal and make sure the latest changes are there\r\n4. Finally, save the changes\r\n5. Reload the Dashboard and make sure the properties were fully saved\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements new models for SIP-68 (https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14909):\r\n\r\n- `Column`\r\n- `Table`\r\n- `Dataset`\r\n\r\nThe associated tables are created with a migration, and the existing datasets (`SqlaTable`, `SqlMetric`, `TableColumn`) are migrated to the new models:\r\n\r\n- A physical dataset is mapped into a `Table` instance and a `Dataset` instance.\r\n- A virtual dataset is mapped into a `Dataset` instance.\r\n- Metrics and columns are mapped into `Column` instances (in the new model it represents physical columns, derived columns, and metrics).\r\n\r\nThe models are kept up-to-date via hooks added to `SqlaTable`, `SqlMetric`, and `TableColumn`. Every time these models are created, deleted, or updated, the new models are updated correspondingly. The sync is unidirectional, from the old models to the new ones.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to modify the backend to **read** from the new models. Initially the API will remain unmodified, but hopefully in the future we might be able to clean it up and modernize it (in some places we haven't migrated to the v1 API yet).\r\n\r\nAfter that, the backend will be modified to **write** to the new models. Once the backend is reading and writing from the new models we can get rid of the old models (including the Druid models).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nNo visual changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen you run the Superset app, the app is loaded via Flask. Flask determines how to load the app by the FLASK_APP env variable. \r\nIn case you would like to develop an app that extends Superset, you can extend the app creation by supplying alternative FLASK_APP value instead of FLASK_APP=\"superset.app:create_app()\"\r\n\r\nbut the Superset Cli group ignores that value by passing a redundant argument to FlaskGroup. \r\n\r\nWhen the create_app argument is missed, it creates the application the same way the app is created on running Flask app\r\n\r\nso when I set alternative value for Flask_app I can run superset init on the extended superset app\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-24T15:22:51Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T17:08:09Z","closed_at":"2021-11-26T17:48:33Z","merged_at":"2021-11-26T17:48:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"da7502829527b4a2221cfbb4495859d517d47ec4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, the filters state is being stored in the URL to allow users to preserve their current interactions in case of a refresh and also to share specific states with other users. The most common example is when a user, after exploring a dashboard using filters, wishes to share their findings with other users. \r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that when the size of the state is big, it provokes URL length problems with the major browsers. \r\n\r\nThe proposed solution in this PR is to store the filters state on the server-side and keep in the URL only a secure key that gives access to the stored content. To do that, we'll extend the current dashboard endpoint with an additional path that supports the storage of information in the form of key-value entries. By making this endpoint relative to the main resource we can reuse the security model and access grants.\r\n\r\nThe additional endpoint and the supported operations are:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nPOST api/v1/dashboard/<id>/filter_state\r\n\r\nBODY \r\n{\r\n   // Any type of JSON supported text.\r\n   value: <string>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nRESPONSE\r\n{\r\n   // The key generated on the server-side\r\n   key: <string>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nPUT api/v1/dashboard/<id>/filter_state/<key>\r\n\r\nBODY\r\n{\r\n   // Any type of JSON supported text.\r\n   value: <string>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nRESPONSE\r\n{\r\n   // The result of the operation\r\n   message: <string>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nGET api/v1/dashboard/<id>/filter_state/<key>\r\n\r\nRESPONSE\r\n{\r\n   // Any type of JSON supported text.\r\n   value: <string>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nDELETE api/v1/dashboard/<id>/filter_state/<key>\r\n\r\nRESPONSE\r\n{\r\n   // The result of the operation\r\n   message: <string>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe keys are generated on the server-side using the https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.token_urlsafe function and the value can be any JSON supported text.\r\n\r\nTo store the key-value entries, this PR uses [Flask-Caching](https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which enables support to different backends like [Redis](https://redis.io/), [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), file system, etc. It also allows the configuration of expiration times for the stored entries in order to discard the ones that are not being used anymore and optimize the required storage space.\r\n\r\nThis PR also allows a configuration to preserve actively accessed entries by renewing the expiration time every time a value is retrieved.\r\n\r\nFollow-up of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17337\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Execute Python tests\r\n2 - All tests should pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the core of the embedded dashboards feature as described in #17187.\r\n\r\nAll commits in this branch have been individually reviewed, so it should be merge-able without requiring detailed review of a large change set.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nIf you're at Preset, we have a demo host app that can help with testing: https://github.com/preset-io/embedded-demo.  Just run that, and you'll be exercising this code.\r\n\r\nIf you're not at Preset, testing this will be more involved until more features, docs, and supporting utils are written. You'll need to build a host app that embeds the new dashboard view, fetches a guest token from the new api, and sends the guest token to the frontend using the `postMessage` and `MessageChannel` browser apis. Future PRs will add an SDK, documentation, UI, and a demo host app to make this easier.\r\n\r\nOther things to QA could be making sure that access rights still work correctly outside the embed feature, but we already have automated tests for this.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

guest token, a permission `can_grant_guest_token`, and methods in security manager to use the guest token as authn. Authorization is left out, for now.\r\n\r\nWe have decided to call this a \"guest token\" rather than an \"embed token\" because it could conceivably have future uses beyond viewing embedded dashboards.\r\n\r\nNote that the token is not yet used for actually checking access to anything. It is only parsed to determine a \"logged in\" state.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe headers were not lining up with the loading layout for when the chart list was empty while they were loading, causing a noticeable jump in size. Very noticeable when pressing any of the sort buttons at the top of the charts table while the table is empty. As described in issue #15127 \r\n\r\n### TL/DR:\r\nEmpty state table cells were being rendered with text that gave the loading bars different widths than what the headers have when rows are empty. \r\n\r\nThe loading bar columns were hard set on `width` instead of `min-width` like the headers, causing slight differences.\r\n\r\nFixed by removing table cell text, removing logic setting hard width on empty columns, adding a class to make them inline-block, 100% width, and 1.2em height. Letting the loading bars stretch to be the size of the columns.\r\n\r\nOther changes were changing the empty state rows to be 12 rows instead of 25 and changing Favorite column size from `'xs'` to `'sm'`\r\n\r\n### DETAILED DESCRIPTION:\r\nWhat was happening was the loading bars that get rendered when the rows are empty and the loading state is true, were having their width being hard set to the size that the columns are. This is what we want when the rows aren't empty but when they are empty having the table headers be set on `min-width` and the columns being set on `width`, was causing some issues.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the loading bar CSS effect covers up the text that is within the columns, which is very nice when you sort a table that has rows with data in it. But the temporary rows and columns that act as the loading bars were being created with the text LOADING in every table cell. This is why it was the loading bars were short and why the column that holds the Favorite star icon was expanding by the length of the word LOADING. \r\n\r\nThe combination of the headers using `min-width`, the columns being set on `width`, and the text \"LOADING\" being in a `<span>`(inline) within the columns is what caused the jump in size and the look of the headers being pushed to the right of the screen when the empty/loading state appeared.\r\n\r\n### THE FIX:\r\nThe fix I went with, is to remove the set width on the columns for the empty/loading table, letting the columns be the same size as their headers. Then create a new class for them that makes the `<span>` inside them inline-block instead of inline, sets width to 100% to fill the whole column, and adds a little height to better match text-filled size. Then remove the loading span, add an aria-label for the progressbar role tag because the text inside the span is no longer acting as the label.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the columns and loading bars are the length of the headers and a jump in size no longer occurs.\r\n\r\n### OTHER CHANGES:\r\nI also changed the size of the Favorite Icon column to be `'sm'` (50px) instead of `'xs'` (25px) because the icons are always about 50px wide.\r\n\r\nI changed the number of rows for the empty/loading table to better match with the size of the container around the 'No Data' graphic that gets displayed after loading is finished and there are no rows. \r\n\r\n### IN CONCLUSION:\r\nI went with what I felt looked the best, made the most sense, and was the least intrusive to the code.\r\n\r\nIf the design and/or the implementation is not giving the desired effect or look, then please let me know so I can change it up.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE:\r\n![BeforeGif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/142944039-73a8afef-eeda-4968-be64-73f1d1a42c06.gif)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1438\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-11-22 at 3 15 15 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/142943264-06da3188-d0e3-4860-b87b-4a1b1721b5be.png\">\r\n\r\n### AFTER:\r\n![AfterGif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/142943891-165f548b-c4b9-4343-8fdc-63b998772728.gif)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1438\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-11-22 at 3 11 25 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/142943447-30ac1715-e6bd-4f5c-96d4-b67d9d7370df.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nApply pivot table post processing to data downloaded as CSV in Pivot Table V2 chart. The CSV data will have pivoted format (see the difference on screenshots).\r\n\r\nWhen on Pivot Table chart, the .CSV button is replaced by a dropdown containing 2 options - Original and Pivoted. Clicking the latter triggers download of pivoted data.\r\nOn all other charts, the CSV button works just like before.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nExample pivot table:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/142918197-0363b4d6-e04f-43a0-847c-a0ab54ab5b46.png)\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/142918482-cb176400-aafa-41f0-8060-0e5531be8d0c.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/142918400-baa5b2c8-cc14-46ba-b02a-53c1c30f4368.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/144300105-ecf116d9-ff37-45c2-b9b9-b110b43d172d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate a pivot table chart, click on download as csv icon. A dropdown with 2 options should open - Original and Pivoted.\r\nClicking Original should download a CSV file formatted like the one on the \"Before\" screenshot.\r\nClicking Pivoted should download a CSV file formatted like the one on the \"After\" screenshot\r\n\r\nThe CSV button on any other chart should work like before - begin download immediately instead of opening a dropdown menu.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes the security manager to also check for dashboard access when `DASHBOARD_RBAC` is disabled. Previously, if `DASHBOARD_RBAC` was disabled, this piece of code was skipped:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncan_access = (\r\n    is_user_admin()\r\n    or is_owner(dashboard, g.user)\r\n    or (dashboard.published and has_rbac_access)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also changed some endpoints to emit a 403 when an access error occurs.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the thirteenth PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\n\r\n## PR description\r\nSeparating the two commands into different modules and some small import fixes\r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere is no logic added so new tests are not

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user added a saved metric to Metric control, then removed that metric in dataset, it left the Metric control in a broken state.\r\nThe reason for that was a faulty logic in a function responsible for synchronising currently added metrics with current state of the dataset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issue\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/142855861-40142f9a-01cf-4e28-bcf3-0e8ca2be3925.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add a saved metric to Metric control and run query\r\n2. Delete that saved metric from dataset\r\n3. Verify that the deleted metric was removed from Metric control and the control is still operable (user is able to add another metric and successfully run query)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: fixes #14034\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\nCC @junlincc @john-bodley @jinghua-qa

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the twelvth PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\n\r\n## PR description\r\nTo meet SRP and preparing QueryContext for decoule it from superset \r\nAll the processing task there were moved to QueryContextProcessor\r\n\r\n*Note- in the next future PR the creation of QueryContextProcssor will be removed from there to the QueryContext clients\r\nand the clients will call the processor and not the QueryContext itself, then the queryContext methods will be removed \r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere is no logic added so new tests are not required\r\n\r\n## Previous PRs\r\n1. #17399\r\n2. #17400 \r\n3. #17405 \r\n4. #17407

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the ninth PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\nThe next PR is #17495 \r\n\r\n\r\n## PR description\r\n1. Decoupling query_object module and Class from Superset\r\n2. adding common fixture utils to create query_context payload for integration and unit_tests\r\n3. moving tests from integration_tests to unit_tests (from  TestSchema to  TestQueryObjectFactory)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere is no logic added so new tests are not required\r\n\r\n## Previous PRs\r\n1. #17399\r\n2. #17400 \r\n3. #17405 \r\n4. #17407 \r\n5. #17425 \r\n6. #17461 \r\n7. #17465 \r\n8. #17466

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the eighth PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\nThe next PR is #17479 \r\n\r\n## PR description\r\nCreating QueryObject is not only an assignment task, it contains some logic.\r\nTo meet the SRP, The creation task should be assigned to an external object.\r\nAfter the PR the QueryObject constructor is decoupled from Superset so in the next PR, the module can be decoupled from Superset \r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere is no logic added so new tests are not required\r\n\r\n## Previous PRs\r\n1. #17399\r\n2. #17400 \r\n3. #17405 \r\n4. #17407 \r\n5. #17425 \r\n6. #17461 \r\n7. #17465

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the seventh PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\nThe next PR is #17466 \r\n\r\n## PR description\r\nas written, decouple QueryObject from its parent and some clean code (method extractions) \r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere are no logic changes, so new tests are not required\r\n\r\n## Previous PRs\r\n1. #17399\r\n2. #17400 \r\n3. #17405 \r\n4. #17407 \r\n5. #17425 \r\n6. #17461

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the sixth PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\nThe next PR is #17465 \r\n\r\n## PR description\r\nmove create queryContext command's responsibility to the command clients (ChartDataRestApi and load_chart_data_into_cache celery task) to achieve meeting the SRP \r\n\r\nNote - moving it to the view layer is an anti-pattern but remember, the refactor is combination of many PRs, so it'll be changed in one of the next PRs\r\nNote 2 - the more optimal design is to encapsulate it under an ad-hoc object or keep refactoring the CommandaData into three separated commands \r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere are no logic changes, only calling ordering so new tests are not required\r\n\r\n## Previous PRs\r\n1. #17399\r\n2. #17400 \r\n3. #17405 \r\n4. #17407 \r\n5. #17425

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nUp until now, when deleting or renaming a database connection, permissions for the old connection name would persist.  Additionally, when renaming a database connection, permissions for access on that database's existing datasets would not be created with the new connection name.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a way to clean up unneeded permissions after a database is renamed or deleted, and also ensures that permissions for a database's associated datasets are kept up-to-date if the database connection is renamed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n* Create a database connection and associated datasets\r\n* Rename the database connection\r\n* See that permissions for the old name are gone and permissions for the new database name have been created\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Pandas timestamp differs from the `datetime.datetime` object and the [isoformat](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.isoformat.html) function doesn't include the `timespec` argument (the help description is wrong), i.e., it results in errors of the form,\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: isoformat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'timespec\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/26131 for more details. The fix is to convert the pandas.TImestamp` object into a `datetime.datetime` object which is consistent with the existing logic, even though \r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>>

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\nThe next PR is #17461 \r\n\r\n\r\n## PR description\r\n1. Moves the commands module to be under charts.data package \r\n2. Retrieving data and creating retrieve data job are two different responsibilities, so they should be in separate commands so the PR split it. \r\n\r\nNote - The pr consists of the #17407 commit until it will be merged then I'll recreate the branch from master\r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere are no logic changes so new tests are not required\r\n\r\n## Previous PRs\r\n1. #17399\r\n2. #17400 \r\n3. #17405 \r\n4. #17407
