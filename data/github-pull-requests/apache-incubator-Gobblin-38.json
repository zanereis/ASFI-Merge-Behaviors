So the Map contains all the pre-runtime values of the WorkUnits. However, on line 308 of Fork.buildWriter(), the value of ConfigurationKeys.WRITER_FILE_PATH is set if it is not currently present in the WorkUnit. Fork.buildWriter() is only called during the runtime of each WorkUnit. So the value of ConfigurationKeys.WRITER_FILE_PATH never makes it into the JobState object. So, the JobLauncherUtils.cleanStagingData() method won’t do anything, as the WorkUnit it is looking at doesn’t have a value for  ConfigurationKeys.WRITER_FILE_PATH.\n\nThis pull request will ensure this doesn't happen again. If the WRITER_FILE_PATH does not exist in the config during cleanup, the code uses its default value to cleanup the data.\n","created_at":"2015-04-14T02:02:07Z","updated_at":"2015-04-14T19:45:17Z","closed_at":"2015-04-14T19:45:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a17688f305c64438b29b00dfda76a4cf68eec61c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/89/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/89/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/89/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e0eedf364904fb3d0a190c7ef3ba85029d0e1f62","head":{"label":"sahilTakiar:cleanup-staging","ref":"cleanup-staging","sha":"e0eedf364904fb3d0a190c7ef3ba85029d0e1f62","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"41e9f5718501378e2aa816633a7068bd83793d23","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27392543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM5MjU0Mw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"apache/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin","description":"A

Warnings:\n\n1:\n\ngobblin.source.workunit.MultiWorkUnitWeightedQueue$WeightedMultiWorkUnit defines compareTo(MultiWorkUnitWeightedQueue$WeightedMultiWorkUnit) and uses Object.equals()\n\nThis class defines a compareTo(...) method but inherits its equals() method from java.lang.Object. Generally, the value of compareTo should return zero if and only if equals returns true. If this is violated, weird and unpredictable failures will occur in classes such as PriorityQueue. In Java 5 the PriorityQueue.remove method uses the compareTo method, while in Java 6 it uses the equals method.\n\nFrom the JavaDoc for the compareTo method in the Comparable interface:\n\n```\nIt is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact. The recommended language is \"Note: this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals.\" \n```\n\n2:\n\nShould gobblin.source.workunit.MultiWorkUnitWeightedQueue$WeightedMultiWorkUnit be a _static_ inner class?\n\nThis class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it.  This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary.

were some bugs in the class that caused converters which conditionally returned varying types of Iterables to not work. For example, if a converter conditionally returned either a EmptyIterable or a SingleRecordIterable, the MultiConverter would not fully iterate through all the records. The new implementation takes into account these scenarios, and there have been more tests added to the test class to check for this behavior.\n\nThe biggest change in design, is that when iterating through the stack of converters to process, if a converter returns an EmptyIterable, then the code should move to the next record returned by the previous converter, rather than quitting.\n","created_at":"2015-03-25T23:21:22Z","updated_at":"2015-03-28T01:50:59Z","closed_at":"2015-03-28T01:50:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd23602553b5842ce30bea9610dc660b938002a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/62/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/62/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/62/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/fa3ed51dc0721dee7321e4c8bca3218cee9d3350","head":{"label":"sahilTakiar:master","ref":"master","sha":"fa3ed51dc0721dee7321e4c8bca3218cee9d3350","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4a9eccad5715db1aec6b44074b27591c04a47c68","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27392543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM5MjU0Mw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"apache/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin","description":"A

`source.querybased.watermark.type=simple` and `extract.delta.fields` contains a comma separated list of fields (e.g: id, type), one of the initial MySQL query looks like this during the job initialization:\n\n`SELECT max(COALESCE(id,type)) FROM test  where  (id,type >= 477 and id,type <= 544);`\n\nThe query syntax seems to be invalid which leads to the following error:\n`java.sql.SQLException: Operand should contain 1 column(s)`\n\nAfter checking the generated queries of other watermark types, I suspect that here the fields in the where clause should be coalesced too (e.g: COALESCE(id,type) >=477...etc)\nIf this is the case (and the where clause is not intended to be a row subquery for instance) then the patch would address this

is the first working version. I created this for the upcoming design review. Please take a look if you get a chance before the design review meeting. A brief description of the design is as follows:\n\nThe basic idea is each fork maintains a bounded blocking queue for buffering records put by the parent task. The parent task is the producer and the fork is the consumer. The task puts new records into the queue of each fork and each fork keeps getting records off its queue until all records get processed. The queue is backed by a `LinkedBlockingDeque` and in additional to normal queue operations, it also keeps track of the following statistics for monitoring purpose:\n- Queue size\n- Queue fill ratio (queue size/queue capacity)\n- Put attempt count\n- Mean rate of put attempts (puts/sec)\n- Get attempt count\n- Mean rate of get attempts (gets/sec)\n\nThe queue is bounded so it won't grow indefinitely. Both puts and gets are blocked with a configurable timeout. Having the puts and gets to timeout prevents the producer and consumer from being blocked indefinitely. Since the fork doesn't know how many records will be put into the queue in advance and an empty queue necessarily doesn't mean the parent task is done (it may just be because the extractor is slow), the fork has a boolean flag `parentTaskDone` that is set by the parent task once it is done (either succeeded or failed). The contract is that the fork should not expect any new incoming records into the queue once `parentTaskDone` is set to `true`. This flag is guaranteed to be set by the parent task even if the task fails.\n\nWhen putting a new record, the task has to make sure the record gets put into the queue of each of its forks. If the forks are slow, the puts may timeout and need to be retried in the next iteration until all puts for the current record succeed, at which point the task can move to the next record. \n\nEach fork also maintain a `ForkState` that tells the current state of the fork. The fork will reject any attempt from the parent task to put new records into the queue if the current state is `ForkState.FAILED` so the parent task is informed. This is necessary in case the fork fails for some reason and the task has no knowledge about the failure and keeps putting new records into the queue. \n\nThe parent task upon completion of all its forks will check if each fork has succeeded (having state `ForkState.SUCCEEDED`) and throws an exception to fail itself if any of its forks failed.\n\nThe forks of a task run in a separate thread pool managed by the task executor. The reason why forks run in a separate thread pool other than the one for running tasks is this avoids an additional race relationship between a task and its forks (in additional to the already existing race against the queue). This is a custom `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a core thread pool size equal to that of the thread pool for running tasks. The reason is there's always at least one fork per task. The thread pool is also essentially unbounded by setting the max thread pool size to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This is to make sure all forks of a task get a thread to run so all forks of the task are making progress. This is necessary since otherwise the parent task will be blocked if the record queue (bounded) of some fork is full and that fork has not yet started to run because of no available thread. The task cannot proceed in this case because it has to make sure every records go to every forks. The work queue of the thread pool executor is a `SynchronousQueue`. This essentially forces new threads to be created if there are more forks to run than the core thread pool size.\n\nThis pull request also include some additional enhancements to the `ExecutorsUtils`

commit contains the following fixes:\n1. When a new job configuration file is added or an existing file is changed, the file is reloaded with properties included from .properties file in the same directory and .properties files in ancestor directories. Then the job is scheduled/rescheduled.\n2. When an existing .properties file is changed, all job configuration files affected will be reloaded and rescheduled, again with properties included from the .properties file and .properties files in ancestor directories. The affected job configuration files include those in the same directory and the ones under the subdirectories (recursively). \n3.

incorporated the requirements discussed in #36. Handling of the command line parameters has been changed accordingly:\n\n$GOBBLIN_HOME/build.gradle:\n- bump avro version to 1.7.6 to conform with the version of avro-mapred\n- force guava version 15.0: otherwise during the build gradle may pick up guava 17.0 and will include it in  \n  the /lib directory\n  instead of the defined version 15.0. (This may lead to issues like\n  IllegalAccessError: tried to access method com.google.common.base.Stopwatch.<init>()V from class \n  org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat)\n\n$GOBBLIN_HOME/conf/gobblin-env.sh:\n- A script to initialize environment variables called by gobblin-standalone.sh and gobblin-mapreduce.sh\n\n$GOBBLIN_HOME/bin/gobblin-mapreduce.sh:\n- Job configuration as command line parameter\n- JobTracker/ResourceManager and FileSystem arguments became optional\n- Accepts multiple job jars as command line arguments\n- $GOBBLIN_WORK_DIR can be overridden by the --workdir parameter\n\n$GOBBLIN_HOME/bin/gobblin-standalone.sh:\n- Job configuration as command line parameter\n- Accepts multiple job jars as command line arguments\n- $GOBBLIN_WORK_DIR can be overridden by the --workdir parameter\n\n$GOBBLIN_HOME/gobblin-runtime/src/main/java/gobblin/runtime/mapreduce/CliMRJobLauncher.java :\n- Use GenericOptionsParser to be able to pick up Gobblin as well as Hadoop related command line  \n  arguments\n\nOthers:\n- Removed internal LinkedIn dependencies from LIBJARS\n- Missing command line toggles (sysconfig and jobconfig)added\n- Load Gobblin related dependencies first to

is the first version. I still need to do some cleanup, add some comments, and write a test. Making this pull request to see what everyone thinks of the approach.\n\nAzkaban only lets the cancel method run for 5 ms, before doing a hard kill on the process. This isn't enough time to cleanup staging data, but should be enough time to kill the Hadoop job (at least based on historical behavior). The OutputCommitter allows the user to hook into the lifecycle of the task and the jobs, so when killJob is called by the client, the AM will call OutputCommitter.abortJob() method. I have over--ridden this method, and added logic to clean up the staging data. Since the AM is in a different process than the client (running on Azkaban), the code de-serializes the WorkUnit files written to HDFS in order to obtain the writer output folder locations. Once it constructs the writer output paths, it deletes them.\n\n@liyinan926 what do you think of this

to see that Gobblin is released, many thanks for open-sourcing it!\nDuring the evaluation of the MR mode I've found some minor issues in the start script which I'd\nlike to fix with this patch. The changes are as follows:\n\ngobblin-mapreduce.sh :\n- Added a new command line parameter: <job jar>\n- Removed internal Linkedin dependencies from LIBJARS\n- Load Gobblin related dependencies first to HADOOP_CLASSPATH to avoid jar hell\n- Introduce gobblin-env.sh\n- Add missing command line toggles (sysconfig and jobconfig)\n\nCliMRJobLauncher.java :\n- Use GenericOptionsParser to be able to pick up Gobblin as well as Hadoop related \n  command line arguments\n\ngobblin-env.sh\n- A script that initializes environment variables used by gobblin-standalone.sh \n  and gobblin-mapreduce.sh\n\nbuild.gradle:\n- bump avro version to 1.7.6 to conform with the version of avro-mapred\n- force guava version 15.0: otherwise during the build gradle may pick up guava 17.0 \n

to the package renaming, the package names of TaskState and JobState changed. Because the current state store uses SequenceFiles that store the fully-qualified class names of the key and value classes in the metafile, Gobblin won't be able to read the state store using the new TaskState and JobState classes unless we migrate the state store to use the new classes.
