to do is to update the Dubbo dependency to the latest 3.0 version. \r\n\r\nThe behavior of the Consumer can be changed when it restarts, the behavior can even be changed on the fly. There is currently 3 migration status:\r\n* INTERFACE_FIRST, this is the default status, this means the Consumer will use the previous `interface` addresses.\r\n* APPLICATION_FIRST, check `application` addresses and `interface` addresses at the same time, switch to `application` when [the condition]() matches.\r\n* FORCE_APPLICATION, force migrate to `application` addresses without any

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-19T01:35:55Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T09:16:30Z","closed_at":"2020-08-26T09:16:24Z","merged_at":"2020-08-26T09:16:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"859c9ba47d392f514afcba7b9abea8367ac2063e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/34","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/34","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/34/labels","id":5540134,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTU0MDEzNA==","number":34,"title":"2.7.9","description":"","creator":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":56,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-15T02:24:14Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T02:36:26Z","due_on":"2020-08-31T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-02-08T02:36:26Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6fbca65a4bd357404f926f190ba005b0825ca881","head":{"label":"lfzCarlosC:fix-code-that-violates-convention","ref":"fix-code-that-violates-convention","sha":"6fbca65a4bd357404f926f190ba005b0825ca881","user":{"login":"lfzCarlosC","id":17321822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzIxODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17321822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC","html_url":"https://github.com/lfzCarlosC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":281916087,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODE5MTYwODc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"lfzCarlosC/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lfzCarlosC","id":17321822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzIxODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17321822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC","html_url":"https://github.com/lfzCarlosC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfzCarlosC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lfzCarlosC/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-17T17:03:01Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T17:13:40Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T17:13:40Z","merged_at":"2020-08-21T17:13:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"392f15952f46340130ba51b08a02536823a5880a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e00ad3e2f8403f8e91152dfa15d8f8f0917d0378","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:remoting-redis","ref":"remoting-redis","sha":"e00ad3e2f8403f8e91152dfa15d8f8f0917d0378","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix-#6594\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-14T03:04:11Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T06:34:42Z","closed_at":"2020-08-18T06:34:42Z","merged_at":"2020-08-18T06:34:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"e24a7b0e5deb79b060aad1114f6e7a171fe00a49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/34","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/34","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/34/labels","id":5540134,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTU0MDEzNA==","number":34,"title":"2.7.9","description":"","creator":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":56,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-15T02:24:14Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T02:36:26Z","due_on":"2020-08-31T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-02-08T02:36:26Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0599c49f8d776a34d5359cd7769c29307d36cea9","head":{"label":"Bricks-Man:master","ref":"master","sha":"0599c49f8d776a34d5359cd7769c29307d36cea9","user":{"login":"Bricks-Man","id":19564203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTY0MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19564203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man","html_url":"https://github.com/Bricks-Man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270891268,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA4OTEyNjg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Bricks-Man/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bricks-Man","id":19564203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTY0MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19564203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man","html_url":"https://github.com/Bricks-Man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bricks-Man/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-13T08:09:29Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T08:16:04Z","closed_at":"2020-08-13T08:16:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9f5dc0254c804d7c0cca35786790178866c415e4","head":{"label":"liyong1028826685:master","ref":"master","sha":"9f5dc0254c804d7c0cca35786790178866c415e4","user":{"login":"liyong1028826685","id":6101259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDEyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6101259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685","html_url":"https://github.com/liyong1028826685","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":242695259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDI2OTUyNTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"liyong1028826685/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liyong1028826685","id":6101259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDEyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6101259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685","html_url":"https://github.com/liyong1028826685","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyong1028826685/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liyong1028826685/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-12T09:31:50Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T09:19:45Z","closed_at":"2020-08-14T09:19:45Z","merged_at":"2020-08-14T09:19:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"e10b8dd6a92d25a08f9e693d6d33a690b1e86251","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/35","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/35","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/35/labels","id":5730092,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTczMDA5Mg==","number":35,"title":"2.6.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-04T07:17:55Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T15:33:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2021-06-08T15:33:01Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6587/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6587/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6587/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a1a9a435b4321c3ab3a1147130da114db752b93a","head":{"label":"mcp2016:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"a1a9a435b4321c3ab3a1147130da114db752b93a","user":{"login":"mcp2016","id":18717197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzE3MTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18717197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016","html_url":"https://github.com/mcp2016","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286944243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY5NDQyNDM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mcp2016/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mcp2016","id":18717197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzE3MTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18717197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016","html_url":"https://github.com/mcp2016","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcp2016/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mcp2016/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-12T05:46:32Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T09:36:50Z","closed_at":"2020-08-14T09:36:50Z","merged_at":"2020-08-14T09:36:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"05be1faa3993003e53dfe640fca5846aabfdf994","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f8e8cb12be2a6843b9636ed121f52f8f0cfd553a","head":{"label":"quhongwei:icbc_bugfix","ref":"icbc_bugfix","sha":"f8e8cb12be2a6843b9636ed121f52f8f0cfd553a","user":{"login":"quhongwei","id":3232378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3232378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei","html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284863201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQ4NjMyMDE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"quhongwei/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"quhongwei","id":3232378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3232378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei","html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-10T17:55:34Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T09:15:28Z","closed_at":"2020-08-14T09:15:28Z","merged_at":"2020-08-14T09:15:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"56353aebc0c678582f7a2309dfd53d29b46deb3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/34","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/34","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/34/labels","id":5540134,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTU0MDEzNA==","number":34,"title":"2.7.9","description":"","creator":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":56,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-15T02:24:14Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T02:36:26Z","due_on":"2020-08-31T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-02-08T02:36:26Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6576/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6576/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6576/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f6fa0ca09bb3f9050f35916332c9abfa728d729c","head":{"label":"likemoongg:fix_execute_npe","ref":"fix_execute_npe","sha":"f6fa0ca09bb3f9050f35916332c9abfa728d729c","user":{"login":"likemoongg","id":22185346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTg1MzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22185346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg","html_url":"https://github.com/likemoongg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"afbf7d5171736dafba56bad7dcb664f1f2ce480e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- support register with pod annotation update\r\n- support service discovery with Kubernetes native service\r\n- support service modification listener with resource watch\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-05T09:07:59Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T14:14:03Z","closed_at":"2020-08-10T02:57:39Z","merged_at":"2020-08-10T02:57:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"1583bc63d02276b005bc2a11b72189540c3cf73b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/89a19ecde97c75795d5ff337c07d23944805732a","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:3.0-kubernetes","ref":"3.0-kubernetes","sha":"89a19ecde97c75795d5ff337c07d23944805732a","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-05T02:38:59Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T04:23:12Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T04:23:12Z","merged_at":"2020-08-05T04:23:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"82ee2eb50749820d0311c679bd2a0936356402c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0f25bea7cb866a5d5ed90736915ac04a8096f7ce","head":{"label":"quhongwei:icbc","ref":"icbc","sha":"0f25bea7cb866a5d5ed90736915ac04a8096f7ce","user":{"login":"quhongwei","id":3232378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3232378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei","html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284863201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQ4NjMyMDE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"quhongwei/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"quhongwei","id":3232378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3232378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei","html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n#6546 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd a new cluster call failover2, and change FailoverClusterInvoker a litter to make it support ignore timeout exception.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUse failover2 cluster, and provide two servers, then make a timeout for that service, no retries will happen\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-26T21:00:12Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T06:52:09Z","closed_at":"2022-03-16T06:52:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee914d13b412452d916b59e487efdb5a6c36d524","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6520/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6520/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6520/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/54b0032f142992f5c74daa5b1547b544b044ae9a","head":{"label":"iqinning:newland","ref":"newland","sha":"54b0032f142992f5c74daa5b1547b544b044ae9a","user":{"login":"iqinning","id":18241433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQxNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18241433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning","html_url":"https://github.com/iqinning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":282091763,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODIwOTE3NjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"iqinning/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iqinning","id":18241433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQxNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18241433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning","html_url":"https://github.com/iqinning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqinning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iqinning/dubbo","description":"Apache

RegistryProtocol's implementation may be adjusted many times by different person, some logic is redundant。For example，in **export** method, **Registry** object is repeatedly acquired，Although It is guaranteed not to be repeatedly generated by **AbstractRegistryFactory** , but It is really a bit inelegant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above adjustments, Some abbreviation have been corrected（e.g. **Configed** to **Configured**）,Some variable name have been adjusted（e.g. **HIDE_KEY_PREFIX** to  **HIDDEN_KEY_PREFIX**）.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-23T00:34:05Z","updated_at":"2021-03-29T01:09:54Z","closed_at":"2021-03-28T07:54:29Z","merged_at":"2021-03-28T07:54:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"283c079786716d9dd571ad0d99fc9ad50f44f010","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #6504 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nGet acl token from the URL, and if it's not empty, use it to initiate the consul KvClient.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n1. Start consul with ACL\r\n2. Add some kv in consul.\r\nConfig config center like this:\r\n```xml\r\n    <dubbo:config-center address=\"consul://127.0.0.1:8500\">\r\n        <dubbo:parameter key=\"token\" value=\"your token\"/>\r\n    </dubbo:config-center>\r\n```\r\n3.Start dubbo application, and it will get configuration from consul.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-22T17:31:52Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T16:50:13Z","closed_at":"2020-07-27T16:50:13Z","merged_at":"2020-07-27T16:50:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"47ed75489206c4c944dd0eb187157eaa0ffc0527","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f5b922fc434299c0910959bcb83c31b5b0fbb7ba","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:consul_config_center","ref":"consul_config_center","sha":"f5b922fc434299c0910959bcb83c31b5b0fbb7ba","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixed issue #1728：System property dubbo.service.delay is invalid\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nReferenceConfigBase.java\r\nServiceConfigBase.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAs described in issue #1728：we can't set dubbo.service.delay to dubbo through System Property，and System-Enviroment、Property-File mechanism also can't work. furthermore, other similar-style config(eg: dubbo.service.filter、dubbo.service.retries) are also invalid.\r\n\r\nThe troublemaker which caused this problem is:\r\n\r\n**public String getPrefix() { return DUBBO + \".service.\" + interfaceName; }**\r\n\r\nDue to these above codes，when getProperty through **CompositeConfiguration**, the packed key is （for examle）: **dubbo.service.org.yiocio.testService.org.yiocio.testService.delay**，this key's format is wrong according to dubbo's config strategy. In my view, dubbo's property-style config have a namespace concept: the first segment is **dubbo** at all times, the second segment is tag for config category（eg: application、registry、service），and the third segment is the id of config object with specific category，of course，the third segment is optional, the last segment is config key. So the override of getPrefix for ServiceConfigBase will break the namespace rule of dubbo config.\r\n\r\n**ReferenceConfig's** situation is similar with **ServiceConfig**.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-22T05:56:35Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T10:02:06Z","closed_at":"2021-04-11T10:02:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a5a22f034695e80ea23fc992767aada89a71dbd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

方法中，代码生成逻辑复杂难读，对其等价重构。\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-17T04:02:31Z","updated_at":"2020-07-24T01:49:26Z","closed_at":"2020-07-24T01:49:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"932ee6ccfb725ee24a363667da4f03d9f94c4420","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6487/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6487/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6487/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5ea089ddd8da7eafaf6ac2004cc77c1c269f041f","head":{"label":"ZhengweiHou:master","ref":"master","sha":"5ea089ddd8da7eafaf6ac2004cc77c1c269f041f","user":{"login":"ZhengweiHou","id":14498342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDk4MzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14498342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhengweiHou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":274034930,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzQwMzQ5MzA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ZhengweiHou/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZhengweiHou","id":14498342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDk4MzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14498342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhengweiHou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhengweiHou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZhengweiHou/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Set the expiration time to 10s and clear the cache every 10s. At the 5s, we put \"aaa\" and \"bbb\" into memory. In theory, after 15s, he should be cleared. When we took the aaa-key in 16s, he was still in memory. And when we took the bbb-key in 21s, he was null. At this time we The bug can be located.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nfix expire cache map\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-16T13:48:56Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T03:47:43Z","closed_at":"2021-03-26T03:47:43Z","merged_at":"2021-03-26T03:47:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d5158fcef4e446eb1c0de00f5a3aa4847d8de26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need reporters to triage"}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6480/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6480/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6480/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ccf39b7f1dd21d5f95afe69152ce0598bfcd2d57","head":{"label":"wenbochang888:fix-expire-cache","ref":"fix-expire-cache","sha":"ccf39b7f1dd21d5f95afe69152ce0598bfcd2d57","user":{"login":"wenbochang888","id":26178822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTc4ODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26178822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888","html_url":"https://github.com/wenbochang888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbochang888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8091c0273f2ce748109bbdb0e09055cd7328592e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-16T13:21:21Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T03:52:04Z","closed_at":"2020-09-30T03:52:04Z","merged_at":"2020-09-30T03:52:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d9583adf26a2d8bd6fb646243a9fe80a77e65d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/868be58593cce9f393ef607608ee552ae6aa0b28","head":{"label":"mengle-yang:master","ref":"master","sha":"868be58593cce9f393ef607608ee552ae6aa0b28","user":{"login":"mengle-yang","id":31506634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTA2NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31506634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang","html_url":"https://github.com/mengle-yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":280063887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODAwNjM4ODc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mengle-yang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mengle-yang","id":31506634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTA2NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31506634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang","html_url":"https://github.com/mengle-yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengle-yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mengle-yang/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor issue #6443 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n即使是Lazy connect的模式，也不应该在请求的时候尝试建连，因为建连是有锁等待，会导致请求堆积。\r\n\r\nlazy模式的第一个请求会主动建连，如果中间请求中断也要依靠ReconnectTimerTask恢复，请求不应该去尝试建连，所以默认关闭lazy的Reconnect，如果确实需要业务可以自己把开关再打开。\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-16T04:39:07Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T09:56:59Z","closed_at":"2021-04-11T09:56:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b394fa733ad98bcefc52e9e78f1d6b1788e492a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAs described in issue #1728：we can't set dubbo.service.delay to dubbo through System Property，and System-Enviroment、Property-File mechanism also can't work. furthermore, other similar-style config(eg: dubbo.service.filter、dubbo.service.retries) are also invalid.\r\n\r\nThe troublemaker which caused this problem is:\r\n\r\n**public String getPrefix() { return DUBBO + \".service.\" + interfaceName; }**\r\n\r\nDue to these above codes，when getProperty through **CompositeConfiguration**, the packed key is （for examle）: **dubbo.service.org.yiocio.testService.org.yiocio.testService.delay**，this key's format is wrong according to dubbo's config strategy. In my view, dubbo's property-style config have a namespace concept: the first segment is **dubbo** at all times, the second segment is tag for config category（eg: application、registry、service），and the third segment is the **id** of config object with specific category，of course，the third segment is optional, the last segment is config key.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nNetty version 4.1.51 fixes some bugs and improves performance\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nUpgrading to the latest version can improve the performance and stability of network transmission\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-10T09:26:02Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T07:31:31Z","closed_at":"2021-03-14T07:31:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4015a902794597c19cdc4c15d45bc85b81a098d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6441/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6441/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6441/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/eef6b3574b5d60052f900ff433c0c087e8b296fd","head":{"label":"skyguard1:upgrade_netty_version","ref":"upgrade_netty_version","sha":"eef6b3574b5d60052f900ff433c0c087e8b296fd","user":{"login":"skyguard1","id":24522024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1","html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":274626224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzQ2MjYyMjQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"skyguard1/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skyguard1","id":24522024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1","html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1/dubbo","description":"Apache

stability of network transmission\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-10T09:01:35Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T09:02:13Z","closed_at":"2020-07-10T09:02:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6440/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6440/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1edf2bf6b85eabee91ace22beb73f0a018d0aea7","head":{"label":"skyguard1:master","ref":"master","sha":"1edf2bf6b85eabee91ace22beb73f0a018d0aea7","user":{"login":"skyguard1","id":24522024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1","html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":274626224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzQ2MjYyMjQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"skyguard1/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skyguard1","id":24522024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1","html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixed issue #1728：System property dubbo.service.delay invalid \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nReferenceConfigBase.java\r\nServiceConfigBase.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAs described in issue #1728：we can't set dubbo.service.delay to dubbo through System Property，and System-Enviroment、Property-File mechanism also can't work. furthermore, other similar-style config(eg: dubbo.service.filter、dubbo.service.retries) are also invalid. \r\n\r\nThe troublemaker which caused this problem is:\r\n\r\n **_public String getPrefix() { return DUBBO + \".service.\" + interfaceName; }_**\r\n\r\nDue to these above codes，when getProperty through **CompositeConfiguration**, the packed key is （for examle）: dubbo.service._**org.yiocio.testService**_._**org.yiocio.testService**_.delay，this key's format is wrong according to dubbo's config strategy. In my view, dubbo's property-style config have a namespace concept: the first segment is **dubbo** at all times, the second segment is tag for config category（eg: application、registry、service），and the third segment is the **id** of  config object with specific category，of course，the third segment is optional, the last segment is config key. So the override of getPrefix for ServiceConfigBase will break the namespace rule of dubbo config.\r\n\r\n**ReferenceConfig**'s situation is similar with **ServiceConfig**.","created_at":"2020-07-10T04:23:44Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T09:52:31Z","closed_at":"2020-07-14T09:52:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcd02da4b028f01e557e519a9c39ac4f03f03c8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6439/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6439/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6439/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/dee7b4db672904972bbeb4fc4efbae1327cb2464","head":{"label":"yiocio:master","ref":"master","sha":"dee7b4db672904972bbeb4fc4efbae1327cb2464","user":{"login":"yiocio","id":5961481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjE0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5961481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio","html_url":"https://github.com/yiocio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a2e5102657a8abe03812f0b025f457ca3d994921","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-09T12:15:37Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T12:17:24Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T12:17:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f37f63e17c1fad206ce1c9059a7a59bf8385ac69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/012da2f7bb4e63a06c9a8d8faf0fd49e16f0b804","head":{"label":"newjourney:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"012da2f7bb4e63a06c9a8d8faf0fd49e16f0b804","user":{"login":"newjourney","id":6204928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDQ5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6204928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney","html_url":"https://github.com/newjourney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118065310,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTgwNjUzMTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"newjourney/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"newjourney","id":6204928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDQ5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6204928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney","html_url":"https://github.com/newjourney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newjourney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/newjourney/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-08T04:04:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T06:12:54Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T06:02:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6429/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6429/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6429/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f90d18f6629c058486f64b53f59ec97e924ad1d6","head":{"label":"xuhuamei:master","ref":"master","sha":"f90d18f6629c058486f64b53f59ec97e924ad1d6","user":{"login":"xuhuamei","id":7554939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTQ5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7554939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei","html_url":"https://github.com/xuhuamei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":277978477,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzc5Nzg0Nzc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xuhuamei/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuhuamei","id":7554939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTQ5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7554939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei","html_url":"https://github.com/xuhuamei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuhuamei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuhuamei/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix the problem: Rest Protocol can't work when use Tomcat 8.0.x as Web Container which is described by issue #6399\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nTomcatHttpServer.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWhen we start Tomcat server by program for embedded Tomcat with version **8.0.x**，\r\n\r\nWe **can't** set the connector by following steps:\r\n1. create a connector using the code: _**new Connector(\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol\")**_;\r\n2. set appropriate property for the created connector , eg: **_connector.setPort(url.getPort()), connector.setProperty(\"\",\"\")_**;\r\n3. set the ready connector to tomcat , eg: **_tomcat.setConnector(connector)_**;\r\n\r\nWe **should** set the connector as follow:\r\n1. got a connector by tomcat's method，pseudocode is :  **_Connector connector = tomcat.getConnector()_**;\r\n2. set appropriate property for the connector returned by tomcat , eg: **_connector.setPort(url.getPort()), connector.setProperty(\"\",\"\")_**;\r\n\r\nThe point is the connector returned by tomcat would be added to **service** object  which belong to tomcat, it's important for tomcat to start connector and listen on given port. But the key action is missed when using the first solution. one thing to note, the first solution is OK for tomcat with higher version(eg: 8.5.31). But, the second solution is compatible with all versions of Tomcat.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we should create connector object by **new Connector(\"HTTP/1.1\")** instead of **new Connector(\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol\")**, because the first practice is more semantic. actually, **org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol** isn't protocol name, it just the name of implementation class for **HTTP/1.1** protocol.","created_at":"2020-07-01T06:28:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T03:39:31Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T03:39:30Z","merged_at":"2020-07-08T03:39:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"44345d5d6a49a7996641129bdbbf812c8263411b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/33/labels","id":5269307,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTI2OTMwNw==","number":33,"title":"2.7.8","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":84,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-03T02:27:18Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T03:21:58Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2020-07-20T03:27:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/79f9bcbde74967443a73e846e1ac40a5f2aade24","head":{"label":"yiocio:master","ref":"master","sha":"79f9bcbde74967443a73e846e1ac40a5f2aade24","user":{"login":"yiocio","id":5961481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjE0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5961481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio","html_url":"https://github.com/yiocio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiocio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ba89f44f5aeddd2d06024232a15e355c2e8dc5cd","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.gi

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* It seems will clear configurators when override's size is null or empty, like:\r\nFisrt loop: override's size is not null, add a element to `configurators`.\r\nSecond loop :override's size is null ,will clear `configurators`.\r\nThird loop :override's size is null , add a element to `configurators`.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-01T03:27:55Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T14:16:08Z","closed_at":"2020-07-01T05:02:14Z","merged_at":"2020-07-01T05:02:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c407deb0044cbae39e242a2bda2b691d3f722a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7331964,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzMxOTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Bugs

export provider error, change to catch throwable, handle NoClassDefFoundError\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn org.apache.dubbo.metadata.store.InMemoryWritableMetadataService.publishServiceDefinition() and org.apache.dubbo.metadata.store.RemoteWritableMetadataService.publishProvider(), call the org.apache.dubbo.metadata.definition.ServiceDefinitionBuilder.build(java.lang.Class<?>) method, where NoClassDefFoundError may occur, So you need to catch the throwable in the outer layer, otherwise it will be difficult to find  the root cause of class loading failure\r\n\r\nPlease review this pull request, thank you\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation
