It was deprecated in 2.4 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23451)  and removed in 3.0 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25867). However, deprecation of BisectingKMeansModel.computeCost missed 2.4 release and was done in 3.0. BisectingKMeansModel.computeCost should be removed in 3.1 to be consistent with KMean. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this introduced an API breaking change,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add method `getTimeFormatters` to `HiveResult` which creates timestamp and date formatters.\r\n2. Move creation of `dateFormatter` and `timestampFormatter` from the constructor of the `HiveResult` object to `HiveResult. hiveResultString()` via `getTimeFormatters`. This allows to resolve time zone ID from Spark's session time zone `spark.sql.session.timeZone` and create date/timestamp formatters only once before collecting `java.sql.Timestamp`/`java.sql.Date` values.\r\n3. Create date/timestamp formatters once in SparkExecuteStatementOperation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix perf regression comparing to Spark 2.4\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suite `HiveResultSuite` and etc.\r\n- Re-generate benchmarks results of `DateTimeBenchmark` in the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTwo new options, _modifiiedBefore_  and _modifiedAfter_, is provided expecting a value in 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss' format.  _PartioningAwareFileIndex_ considers these options during the process of checking for files, just before considering applied _PathFilters_ such as `pathGlobFilter.`  In order to filter file results, a new PathFilter class was derived for this purpose.  General house-keeping around classes extending PathFilter was performed for neatness.  It became apparent support was needed to handle multiple potential path filters.  Logic was introduced for this purpose and the associated tests written.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen loading files from a data source, there can often times be thousands of file within a respective file path.  In many cases I've seen, we want to start loading from a folder path and ideally be able to begin loading files having modification dates past a certain point.  This would mean out of thousands of potential files, only the ones with modification dates greater than the specified timestamp would be considered.  This saves a ton of time automatically and reduces significant complexity managing this in code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces an option that can be used with batch-based Spark file data sources.  A documentation update was made to reflect an example and usage of the new data source option.\r\n\r\n**Example Usages**  \r\n_Load all CSV files modified after date:_ \r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedAfter\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()`\r\n\r\n_Load all CSV files modified before date:_\r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedBefore\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()`  \r\n\r\n_Load all CSV files modified between two dates:_ \r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedAfter\",\"2019-01-15T05:00:00\").option(\"modifiedBefore\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()  \r\n`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nA handful of unit tests were added to support the positive, negative, and edge case code paths. It's also live in a handful of our Databricks dev environments.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Hive mode, permanent functions are shared with Hive metastore so that functions may be modified by other Hive client. With in long-lived spark scene, it's hard to update the change of function.\r\n\r\nHere are 2 reasons:\r\n* Spark cache the function in memory using `FunctionRegistry`.\r\n* User may not know the location or classname of udf when using `replace function`.\r\n\r\nNote that we use v2 command code path to add new command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nGive a easy way to make spark function registry sync with Hive metastore.\r\nThen we can call\r\n```\r\nrefresh function functionName\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, new command.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the flaky testcase \"barrier stage should fail if only partial tasks are launched\" for SPARK-31485 by extending `spark.locality.wait.process`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI noticed sometimes the testcase for SPARK-31485 fails.\r\n[This](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/124086/testReport/org.apache.spark.scheduler/BarrierTaskContextSuite/SPARK_31485__barrier_stage_should_fail_if_only_partial_tasks_are_launched/) is an one instance.\r\nOr, you can easily reproduce by running the testcase with setting `spark.locality.wait.process` to `0s`.\r\n\r\nThe reason should be related to the locality wait. \r\nIf the scheduler waits for a resource offer which meets the preferred location for a task until the time-limit of process-local but no resource can be offered for the locality level, the scheduler will give up the preferred location. In this case, such task can be assigned to off-preferred location.\r\nThe testcase for SPARK-31485, there are two tasks and only one task is supposed to be assigned at one schedule round but both two tasks can be assigned in that situation mentioned above and the testcase will fail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThe modified

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to specify the version of ChromeDriver and RemoteWebDriver which work with guava 14.0.1 explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n#28585 (SPARK-31765) upgraded HtmlUnit due to a security reason and Selenium was also needed to be upgraded to work with the upgraded HtmlUnit.\r\nAfter upgrading Selenium, ChromeDriver and RemoteWebDriver are implicitly upgraded because of dependency and the implicitly upgraded modules can't work with guava 14.0.1 due to an API compatibility so we need to run ChromeUISeleniumSuite with a guava version specified like `-Dguava.version=25.0-jre`.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Dguava.version=25.0-jre -Dspark.test.webdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/chromedriver -Dtest.default.exclude.tags= \"testOnly org.apache.spark.ui.UISeleniumSuite\"\r\n```\r\nIt's a little bit inconvenience so let's use older version which can work with guava 14.0.1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nConfirmed that the following test can finish successfully.\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Dspark.test.webdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/chromedriver -Dtest.default.exclude.tags=  clean \"testOnly org.apache.spark.ui.ChromeUISeleniumSuite\"\r\n```\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn a SELECT statement, the QUALIFY clause filters the results of window functions.\r\nQUALIFY does with window functions what HAVING does with aggregate functions and GROUP BY clauses.\r\nIn the execution order of a query, QUALIFY is therefore evaluated after window functions are computed.\r\nExamples:\r\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/qualify.html#examples\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport  QUALIFY sentence.  make SQL more flexiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nPeople can use `QUALIFY` like below:\r\nCreate and load a table:\r\n```\r\ncreate table qt (i integer, p char(1), o integer);\r\ninsert into qt (i, p, o) values\r\n    (1, 'A', 1),\r\n    (2, 'A', 2),\r\n    (3, 'B', 1),\r\n    (4, 'B', 2);\r\n```\r\nThis query uses nesting rather than QUALIFY:\r\n```\r\nselect * \r\n    from (\r\n         select i, p, o, \r\n                row_number() over (partition by p order by o) as row_num\r\n            from qt\r\n        )\r\n    where row_num = 1\r\n    ;\r\n+---+---+---+---------+\r\n| I | P | O | ROW_NUM |\r\n|---+---+---+---------|\r\n| 1 | A | 1 |       1 |\r\n| 3 | B | 1 |       1 |\r\n+---+---+---+---------+\r\n```\r\nThis query uses QUALIFY:\r\n```\r\nselect i, p, o\r\n    from qt\r\n    qualify row_number() over (partition by p order by o) = 1\r\n    ;\r\n+---+---+---+\r\n| I | P | O |\r\n|---+---+---|\r\n| 1 | A | 1 |\r\n| 3 | B | 1 |\r\n+---+---+---+\r\n```\r\nYou can also use QUALIFY to reference window functions that are in the SELECT column list:\r\n```\r\nselect i, p, o, row_number() over (partition by p order by o) as row_num\r\n    from qt\r\n    qualify row_num = 1\r\n    ;\r\n+---+---+---+---------+\r\n| I | P | O | ROW_NUM |\r\n|---+---+---+---------|\r\n| 1 | A | 1 |       1 |\r\n| 3 | B | 1 |       1 |\r\n+---+---+---+---------+\r\n```\r\nYou can see how the QUALIFY acts as a filter by removing the QUALIFY from the previous query and comparing the output:\r\n```\r\nselect i, p, o, row_number() over (partition by p order by o) as row_num\r\n    from qt\r\n    ;\r\n+---+---+---+---------+\r\n| I | P | O | ROW_NUM |\r\n|---+---+---+---------|\r\n| 1 | A | 1 |       1 |\r\n| 2 | A | 2 |       2 |\r\n| 3 | B | 1 |       1 |\r\n| 4 | B | 2 |       2 |\r\n+---+---+---+---------+\r\n```\r\nThe QUALIFY clause can also be combined with aggregates and can have subqueries in the predicate, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nselect c2, sum(c3) over (partition by c2) as r\r\n  from t1\r\n  where c3 < 4\r\n  group by c2, c3\r\n  having sum(c1) > 3\r\n  qualify r in (\r\n    select min(c1)\r\n      from test\r\n      group by c2\r\n      having min(c1) > 3);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-16T03:22:24Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T08:58:55Z","closed_at":"2020-06-18T06:14:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48b6ec309c436a7aad4b09e5f797cbd27e93f42c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c701b321580347c02d22d764a1d4c688beb58bef","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-31561","ref":"SPARK-31561","sha":"c701b321580347c02d22d764a1d4c688beb58bef","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR brings https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28751 back\r\n\r\n- It once reverted by 4a25200 because of inevitable maven test failure\r\n    - See related updates in this followup https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/a0187cd6b59a6b6bb2cadc6711bb663d4d35a844\r\n\r\n- And reverted again because of the flakiness of the added unit tests\r\n   - In this PR, The flakiness reason found is caused by the hive metastore connection that the SparkSQLCLIService trying to create which turns out is unnecessary at all. This metastore client points to a dummy metastore server only.\r\n   - Also, add some cleanups for SharedThriftServer trait in before and after to prevent its configurations being polluted or polluting others\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nfix flaky test\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\npassing sbt and maven

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPlease refer the next section `Why are the changes needed?` for details how the current implementation of `concat_ws` is broken for some condition.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the code generation logic for columns having at least one array types of columns in `concat_ws` to build two arrays for storing isNull and value from children's generated code and pass these arrays to the both varargCounts and varargBuilds. This change guarantees that both varargCounts and varargBuilds can access the relevant local variables the children's generated code makes as array parameters, which is critical to ensure both varargCounts and varargBuilds succeed to compile.\r\n\r\nBelow is the generated code for newly added UT, `SPARK-31993: concat_ws in agg function with plenty of string/array types columns`.\r\n\r\n> before the patch\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* 001 */ public java.lang.Object generate(Object[] references) {\r\n/* 002 */   return new SpecificUnsafeProjection(references);\r\n/* 003 */ }\r\n/* 004 */\r\n/* 005 */ class SpecificUnsafeProjection extends org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeProjection {\r\n/* 006 */\r\n/* 007 */   private Object[] references;\r\n/* 008 */   private org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter[] mutableStateArray_0 = new org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter[1];\r\n/* 009 */\r\n/* 010 */   public SpecificUnsafeProjection(Object[] references) {\r\n/* 011 */     this.references = references;\r\n/* 012 */     mutableStateArray_0[0] = new org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter(1, 32);\r\n/* 013 */\r\n/* 014 */   }\r\n/* 015 */\r\n/* 016 */   public void initialize(int partitionIndex) {\r\n/* 017 */\r\n/* 018 */   }\r\n/* 019 */\r\n/* 020 */   // Scala.Function1 need this\r\n/* 021 */   public java.lang.Object apply(java.lang.Object row) {\r\n/* 022 */     return apply((InternalRow) row);\r\n/* 023 */   }\r\n/* 024 */\r\n/* 025 */   public UnsafeRow apply(InternalRow i) {\r\n/* 026 */     mutableStateArray_0[0].reset();\r\n/* 027 */\r\n/* 028 */\r\n/* 029 */     mutableStateArray_0[0].zeroOutNullBytes();\r\n/* 030 */\r\n/* 031 */     apply_0_0(i);\r\n/* 032 */     apply_0_1(i);\r\n/* 033 */     int varargNum_0 = 30;\r\n/* 034 */     int idxInVararg_0 = 0;\r\n/* 035 */\r\n/* 036 */     if (!isNull_2) {\r\n/* 037 */       varargNum_0 += value_2.numElements();\r\n/* 038 */     }\r\n/* 039 */\r\n/* 040 */     if (!isNull_3) {\r\n/* 041 */       varargNum_0 += value_3.numElements();\r\n/* 042 */     }\r\n/* 043 */\r\n/* 044 */     UTF8String[] array_0 = new UTF8String[varargNum_0];\r\n/* 045 */     idxInVararg_0 = varargBuildsConcatWs_0_0(i, array_0, idxInVararg_0);\r\n/* 046 */     idxInVararg_0 = varargBuildsConcatWs_0_1(i, array_0, idxInVararg_0);\r\n/* 047 */     idxInVararg_0 = varargBuildsConcatWs_0_2(i, array_0, idxInVararg_0);\r\n/* 048 */     UTF8String value_0 = UTF8String.concatWs(((UTF8String) references[0] /* literal */), array_0);\r\n/* 049 */     boolean isNull_0 = value_0 == null;\r\n/* 050 */     mutableStateArray_0[0].write(0, value_0);\r\n/* 051 */     return (mutableStateArray_0[0].getRow());\r\n/* 052 */   }\r\n/* 053 */\r\n/* 054 */\r\n/* 055 */   private void apply_0_1(InternalRow i) {\r\n/* 056 */     UTF8String value_25 = i.getUTF8String(22);UTF8String value_26 = i.getUTF8String(23);UTF8String value_27 = i.getUTF8String(24);UTF8String value_28 = i.getUTF8String(25);UTF8String value_29 = i.getUTF8String(26);UTF8String value_30 = i.getUTF8String(27);UTF8String value_31 = i.getUTF8String(28);UTF8String value_32 = i.getUTF8String(29);UTF8String value_33 = i.getUTF8String(30);\r\n/* 057 */   }\r\n/* 058 */\r\n/* 059 */\r\n/* 060 */   private int varargBuildsConcatWs_0_0(InternalRow i, UTF8String [] array_0, int idxInVararg_0) {\r\n/* 061 */\r\n/* 062 */\r\n/* 063 */     if (!isNull_2) {\r\n/* 064 */       final int n_0 = value_2.numElements();\r\n/* 065 */       for (int j = 0; j < n_0; j ++) {\r\n/* 066 */         array_0[idxInVararg_0 ++] = value_2.getUTF8String(j);\r\n/* 067 */       }\r\n/* 068 */     }\r\n/* 069 */\r\n/* 070 */     if (!isNull_3) {\r\n/* 071 */       final int n_1 = value_3.numElements();\r\n/* 072 */       for (int j = 0; j < n_1; j ++) {\r\n/* 073 */         array_0[idxInVararg_0 ++] = value_3.getUTF8String(j);\r\n/* 074 */       }\r\n/* 075 */     }\r\n/* 076 */     array_0[idxInVararg_0 ++] = false ?

(In other words, not all columns are string type.)\r\n* Splitting methods is triggered in `splitExpressionsWithCurrentInputs`.\r\n  * This is a bit tricky, as the method won't split methods under whole stage codegen, as well as it will be simply no-op (inlined) if the number of blocks to convert into methods is 1.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a0187cd6b59a6b6bb2cadc6711bb663d4d35a844/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/stringExpressions.scala#L88-L195\r\n\r\nThere're three parts of generated code in `concat_ws` (`codes`, `varargCounts`, `varargBuilds`) and all parts try to split method by itself, while `varargCounts` and `varargBuilds` refer on the generated code in `codes`, hence the overall generated code fails to compile if any of part succeeds to split.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs added. (One for verification of the patch, another one for regression test)","created_at":"2020-06-15T08:14:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T06:47:35Z","closed_at":"2020-06-19T06:01:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"687051e311dcec3174f62d7dd8ce1958f0207b65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28831/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28831/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28831/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2477d119fd1de18a07e02d0b0d5e19f268472d9b","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-31993","ref":"SPARK-31993","sha":"2477d119fd1de18a07e02d0b0d5e19f268472d9b","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Change the max step from 1 week to 30 minutes in the tests `RebaseDateTimeSuite`.`generate 'gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json'` and `generate 'julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json'`.\r\n2. Parallelise JSON files generation in the function `generateRebaseJson` by using `ThreadUtils.parmap`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To prevent the bugs that are fixed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28787 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28816.\r\n2. The parallelisation speeds up JSON file generation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy generating the JSON file

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixing the `getRootFields` and `sortLeftFieldsByRight` functions to preserve attribute metadata\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis can lead to a potential loss of metadata on an attribute in some code paths.\r\n\r\nFor example - when reading a parquet file with a schema that has metadata and writing it back the parquet footer it will not contain the metadata that was originally there.\r\n\r\ncode snippet to reproduce (assuming datasource v2):\r\n```Scala\r\n    // create custom dataset\r\n    val data = Seq(\r\n      Row(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n    )\r\n    val schema = List(\r\n      StructField(\"col_a\", StringType, true,\r\n        new sql.types.MetadataBuilder().putString(\"key\", \"value\").build()),\r\n      StructField(\"col_b\", StringType, true)\r\n    )\r\n    val df = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n      spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data),\r\n      StructType(schema)\r\n    )\r\n    // write\r\n    df.write.parquet(\"/tmp/check\")\r\n    // read and verify the metadata exists\r\n    val readDF = spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/check\")\r\n    readDF.schema.foreach(s => println(s.metadata))\r\n    // write again\r\n    readDF.write.parquet(\"/tmp/check2\")\r\n    // read again and verify no metadata\r\n    val readDF2 = spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/check2\")\r\n    readDF2.schema.foreach(s => println(s.metadata))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this doesn't happen in datasource v1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo tests were added as this is a minor change to a private function and no tests exist to check this function so far.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-14T15:51:59Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T00:38:42Z","closed_at":"2021-03-02T00:38:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afe57385dbba6de2b1e90b9d7c537f21710ef12b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/63e2645fca3a4994e7494c4fc332bc4ca8cdee5e","head":{"label":"guykhazma:spark31988","ref":"spark31988","sha":"63e2645fca3a4994e7494c4fc332bc4ca8cdee5e","user":{"login":"guykhazma","id":33684427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjg0NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33684427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma","html_url":"https://github.com/guykhazma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":232538105,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzI1MzgxMDU=","name":"spark","full_name":"guykhazma/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guykhazma","id":33684427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjg0NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33684427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma","html_url":"https://github.com/guykhazma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guykhazma/spark","description":"Apache

This allows to avoid unnecessary conversion from `TimeZone` to `ZoneId`, for example in\r\n```scala\r\n  def rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros(micros: Long): Long = {\r\n    ...\r\n      if (rebaseRecord == null || micros < rebaseRecord.switches(0)) {\r\n        rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros(timeZone.toZoneId, micros)\r\n```\r\nand back to `TimeZone` inside of `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros(zoneId: ZoneId, ...)`\r\n\r\n3. Modify tests in `RebaseDateTimeSuite`, and set the default JVM time zone only for functions that depend on it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Ignoring passed parameter and using a global variable is bad practice.\r\n2. Dependency from the global state doesn't allow to run the functions in parallel otherwise there is non-zero probability that the functions may return wrong result if the default JVM is changed during their execution.\r\n3. This open opportunity for parallelisation of JSON files generation `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` and `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json`. Currently, the tests `generate 'gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json'` and `generate 'julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json'` generate the JSON files by iterating over all time zones sequentially w/ step of 1 week. Due to the large step, we can miss some spikes in diffs between 2 calendars (Java 8 Gregorian and Java 7 hybrid calendars) as the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28787 fixed and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28816 should fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing tests from `RebaseDateTimeSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-13T19:09:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:26:36Z","closed_at":"2020-06-16T12:57:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16b2ce89a483a5d7b780c75a5c0bb723373f2afa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f4f2863212ec85dcc89de85d65aa9f40217c4be","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:pure-micros-rebasing","ref":"pure-micros-rebasing","sha":"9f4f2863212ec85dcc89de85d65aa9f40217c4be","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to support guava version configurable from command line for sbt.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n#28455 added the configurability for Maven but not for sbt.\r\nsbt is usually faster than Maven so it's useful for developers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed the guava version is changed with the following commands.\r\n```\r\n $ build/sbt \"inspect tree clean\"  | grep

when you take an average of a Timestamp, you'll end up with a Double, representing the seconds since epoch. This is because of old Hive behavior.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that it is better to return a Timestamp, to make the behavior more congruent with the max function, for example:\r\n```\r\nscala> df.agg(max(\"ts\"), avg(\"ts\")).show()\r\n+-------------------+----------+\r\n|            max(ts)|   avg(ts)|\r\n+-------------------+----------+\r\n|2018-03-04 06:11:40|7.126971E8|\r\n+-------------------+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might also improve performance because we get rid of the implicit cast.\r\n\r\nBehaviour in Postgres:\r\n```\r\nroot@8c4241b617ec:/# psql postgres postgres\r\npsql (12.3 (Debian 12.3-1.pgdg100+1))\r\nType \"help\" for help.\r\n\r\npostgres=# CREATE TABLE timestamp_demo (ts TIMESTAMP);\r\nCREATE TABLE\r\npostgres=# INSERT INTO timestamp_demo VALUES('2019-01-01 18:22:11');\r\nINSERT 0 1\r\npostgres=# INSERT INTO timestamp_demo VALUES('2018-01-01 18:22:11');\r\nINSERT 0 1\r\npostgres=# INSERT INTO timestamp_demo VALUES('2017-01-01 18:22:11');\r\nINSERT 0 1\r\npostgres=# SELECT AVG(ts) FROM timestamp_demo;\r\nERROR:  function avg(timestamp without time zone) does not exist\r\nLINE 1: SELECT AVG(ts) FROM timestamp_demo;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehaviour in MySQL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@bab43a5731e8:/# mysql\r\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReturn a Timestamp when taking the average of a Timestamp column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI believe that it is awkward to implicitly change the type when doing an average.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will return a Timestamp instead of a Double when taking an average of a Timestamp column.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsing unit tests and existing

is WIP since it is on top of SPARK-31197 (which itself is WIP on top off SPARK-20629 ) and should probably have more testing. We use SPARK-31197's exiting of the executor once decommissioning is finished to allow us to replace the usage of killExecutor with decommission executor when enabled during dynamic allocation.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf graceful decommissioning is enabled, Spark's dynamic scaling uses this instead of directly killing executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen scaling down Spark we should avoid triggering recomputes as much as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nHopefully their jobs run faster. It also enables experimental shuffle service free decommissioning when graceful decommissioning is enabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFor now I've extended the ExecutorAllocationManagerSuite to cover this.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExit the executor when it has been asked to decommission and there is nothing left for it to do.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf we want to use decommissioning in Spark's own scale down we should terminate the executor once finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe decommissioned executors will exit and the end of decommissioning. This is sort of a user facing change, however decommissioning hasn't been in any releases yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI changed the unit test to not send the executor exit message and still wait on the executor exited

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt fixes microseconds rebasing from the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian) to Proleptic Gregorian calendar in the function `RebaseDateTime`.`rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros(zoneId: ZoneId, micros: Long): Long` in the case of local timestamp overlapping.\r\n\r\nIn the case of overlapping, we look ahead of 1 day to determinate which instant we should take - earlier or later zoned timestamp. If our current standard zone and DST offsets are equal to zone offset of the next date, we choose the later timestamp otherwise the earlier one. For example, the local timestamp **1945-11-18 01:30:00.0** can be mapped to two instants (microseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00Z): -761211000000000 or -761207400000000. If the first one is passed to `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()`, we take the earlier instant in Proleptic Gregorian calendar while rebasing **1945-11-18T01:30+09:00[Asia/Hong_Kong]** otherwise the later one **1945-11-18T01:30+08:00[Asia/Hong_Kong]**.\r\n\r\nNote: The fix assumes that only one transition of standard or DST offsets can occur during a day.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent implementation of `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` handles timestamps overlapping only during daylight saving time but overlapping can happen also during transition from one standard time zone to another one. For example in the case of `Asia/Hong_Kong`, the time zone switched from `Japan Standard Time` (UTC+9) to `Hong Kong Time` (UTC+8) on _Sunday, 18 November, 1945 01:59:59 AM_. The changes allow to handle the special case as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThere is no behaviour change for timestamps of CE after 0001-01-01. The PR might affects timestamps of BCE for which the modified `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` is called directly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. By existing tests in `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `RebaseDateTimeSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite` and `TimestampFormatterSuite`.\r\n\r\n2. Added new checks to `RebaseDateTimeSuite`.`SPARK-31959: JST -> HKT at Asia/Hong_Kong in 1945`:\r\n```scala\r\n      assert(rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros(hkZid, rebasedEarlierMicros) === earlierMicros)\r\n      assert(rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros(hkZid, rebasedLaterMicros) === laterMicros)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Regenerated `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json` with the step of 30 minutes, and got the same JSON file. The JSON file isn't affected because previously it was generated with the step of 1 week. And the spike in diffs/switch points during 1 hour of timestamp overlapping wasn't

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the bug in microseconds rebasing during transitions from one standard time zone offset to another one. In the PR, I propose to change the implementation of `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros` which performs rebasing via local timestamps. In the case of overlapping:\r\n1. Check that the original instant belongs to earlier or later instant of overlapped local timestamp.\r\n2. If it is an earlier instant, take zone and DST offsets from the previous day otherwise\r\n3. Set time zone offsets to Julian timestamp from the next day.\r\n\r\nNote: The fix assumes that transitions cannot happen more often than once per 2 days.\r\n\r\nAdopt the test \"SPARK-31959: JST -> HKT at Asia/Hong_Kong in 1945\" to outdated tzdb. Old JDK can have outdated time zone database in which Asia/Hong_Kong doesn't have timestamp overlapping in 1945 at all. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Current implementation handles timestamps overlapping only during daylight saving time but overlapping can happen also during transition from one standard time zone to another one. For example in the case of `Asia/Hong_Kong`, the time zone switched from `Japan Standard Time` (UTC+9) to `Hong Kong Time` (UTC+8) on _Sunday, 18 November, 1945 01:59:59 AM_. The changes allow to handle the special case as well.\r\n2. To fix the test failures on old JDK w/ outdated tzdb like on Jenkins machine `research-jenkins-worker-09`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt might affect micros rebasing in before common era when not-optimised version of `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` is used directly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By existing tests in `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `RebaseDateTimeSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite` and `TimestampFormatterSuite`.\r\n2. Added new test to `RebaseDateTimeSuite`\r\n3. Regenerated `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` with the step of 30 minutes, and got the same JSON file. The JSON file isn't affected because previously it was generated with the step of 1 week. And the spike in diffs/switch points during 1 hour of timestamp overlapping wasn't detected.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark can't push down scan predicate condition of **Or**:\r\nSuch as if I have a table `default.test`, it's partition col is `dt`,\r\nIf we use query : \r\n```\r\nselect * from default.test \r\nwhere dt=20190625 or (dt = 20190626 and id in (1,2,3) )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, Spark will resolve **Or** condition as one expression, and since this expr has reference of \"id\", then it can't been push down.\r\n\r\nBase on pr https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28733, In my PR ,  for SQL like \r\n`select * from default.test`\r\n `where  dt = 20190626  or  (dt = 20190627  and xxx=\"a\")   `\r\n\r\nFor this  condition `dt = 20190626  or  (dt = 20190627  and xxx=\"a\"   )`, it will  been converted  to CNF\r\n```\r\n(dt = 20190626 or dt = 20190627) and (dt = 20190626 or xxx = \"a\" )\r\n```\r\nthen condition `dt = 20190626 or dt = 20190627` will be push down when partition pruning\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOptimize

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn case of HashAggregation, a partial aggregation(update) is done followed by final aggregation(merge) \r\n\r\nDuring partial aggregation we sort and spill to disk every-time       fby, when the fast Map(when enabled) and  UnsafeFixedWidthAggregationMap gets exhausted\r\n\r\n**When the cardinality of grouping column is close to the total number of records being processed, the sorting of data spilling to disk is not required, since it is kind of no-op and we can directly use rows in Final aggregation.**\r\n\r\nWhen the user is aware of nature of data, currently he has no control over disabling this sort, spill operation.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to following issues in Hive:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-223\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-291\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the ability to disable sort/spill during partial aggregation is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to add pagination support for all-jobs timeline.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf there are lots of jobs, rendering performance of all jobs timeline can significantly goes down. This issue is reported in SPARK-31967.\r\nFor example, after the following operation, UI loading can take >40 sec.\r\n```\r\n(1 to 1000).foreach(_ => sc.parallelize(1 to 10).collect) \r\n```\r\nAlthough it's not the fundamental solution, pagination can mitigate the issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nBefore this change, all displayable jobs are displayed in one page.\r\n<img width=\"1437\" alt=\"all-jobs-shown\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/84437843-9dae9380-ac70-11ea-80db-deb847022ad3.png\">\r\nAfter this change, 2 text boxes are added.\r\nOne is to set the maximum number of jobs to be displayed in a page and the other is to set  the page number.\r\n`Go` button is also added and if it's pushed, jobs are  re-rendered based on the page size and page number.\r\n<img width=\"1437\" alt=\"all-jobs-pagination\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/84437254-a6529a00-ac6f-11ea-8694-e8b1cb1ff30a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdditional testcase with the following command.\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn -Dguava.version=25.0-jre

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to extract SQL reserved/non-reserved keywords from the ANTLR grammar file (`SqlBase.g4`) directly.\r\n\r\nThis approach is based on the @cloud-fan suggestion: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28779#issuecomment-642033217\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt is hard to maintain a full set of the keywords in `TableIdentifierParserSuite`, so it would be nice if we could extract them from the `SqlBase.g4` file directly. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use \"mdc.XXX\" as the consistent key for both `sc.setLocalProperty` and `log4j.properties` when setting up configurations for MDC.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's weird that we use \"mdc.XXX\" as key to set MDC value via `sc.setLocalProperty` while we use \"XXX\" as key to set MDC pattern in log4j.properties. It could also bring extra burden to the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, as MDC feature is added in version 3.1, which hasn't been released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move the doctests in `registerJavaUDAF` and `registerJavaFunction` to the proper unittests that run conditionally when the test classes are present.\r\n\r\nBoth tests are dependent on the test classes in JVM side, `test.org.apache.spark.sql.JavaStringLength` and `test.org.apache.spark.sql.MyDoubleAvg`. So if you run the tests against the plain `sbt package`, it fails as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nFile \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/udf.py\", line 366, in pyspark.sql.udf.UDFRegistration.registerJavaFunction\r\nFailed example:\r\n    spark.udf.registerJavaFunction(\r\n        \"javaStringLength\", \"test.org.apache.spark.sql.JavaStringLength\", IntegerType())\r\nException raised:\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n   ...\r\ntest.org.apache.spark.sql.JavaStringLength, please make sure it is on the classpath;\r\n...\r\n   6 of   7 in pyspark.sql.udf.UDFRegistration.registerJavaFunction\r\n   2 of   4 in pyspark.sql.udf.UDFRegistration.registerJavaUDAF\r\n***Test Failed*** 8 failures.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to support to run the tests against the plain SBT build. See also https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./build/sbt -DskipTests -Phive-thriftserver clean package\r\ncd python\r\n./run-tests --python-executable=python3 --testname=\"pyspark.sql.udf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen using pyarrow to convert a Pandas categorical column, use `is_categorical` instead of trying to import `CategoricalDtype`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe import for `CategoricalDtype` had changed from Pandas 0.23 to 1.0 and pyspark currently tries both locations. Using `is_categorical` is a more stable API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf a Spark distribution has built-in hadoop runtime, Spark will not populate the hadoop classpath from `yarn.application.classpath` and `mapreduce.application.classpath` when a job is submitted to Yarn. Users can override this behavior by setting `spark.yarn.populateHadoopClasspath` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this, Spark will populate the hadoop classpath from `yarn.application.classpath` and `mapreduce.application.classpath` even Spark distribution has built-in hadoop.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the bug in microseconds rebasing during transitions from one standard time zone offset to another one. In the PR, I propose to change the implementation of `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros` which performs rebasing via local timestamps. In the case of overlapping:\r\n1. Check that the original instant belongs to earlier or later instant of overlapped local timestamp.\r\n2. If it is an earlier instant, take zone and DST offsets from the previous day otherwise\r\n3. Set time zone offsets to Julian timestamp from the next day.\r\n\r\nNote: The fix assumes that transitions cannot happen more often than once per 2 days.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent implementation handles timestamps overlapping only during daylight saving time but overlapping can happen also during transition from one standard time zone to another one. For example in the case of `Asia/Hong_Kong`, the time zone switched from `Japan Standard Time` (UTC+9) to `Hong Kong Time` (UTC+8) on _Sunday, 18 November, 1945 01:59:59 AM_. The changes allow to handle the special case as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt might affect micros rebasing in before common era when not-optimised version of `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` is used directly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By existing tests in `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `RebaseDateTimeSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite` and `TimestampFormatterSuite`.\r\n2. Added new test to `RebaseDateTimeSuite`\r\n3. Regenerated `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` with the step of 30 minutes, and got the same JSON file. The JSON file isn't affected because previously it was generated with the step of 1 week. And the spike in diffs/switch points during 1 hour of timestamp overlapping wasn't

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn LogisticRegression and LinearRegression, if set maxIter=n, the model.summary.totalIterations returns  n+1 if the training procedure does not drop out. This is because we use ```objectiveHistory.length``` as totalIterations, but ```objectiveHistory``` contains init sate, thus ```objectiveHistory.length``` is 1 larger than number of training iterations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\ncorrectness\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd new tests and also modify existing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23388 .\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23388 has an issue: it doesn't handle subquery expressions and assumes they will be turned into joins. However, this is not true for non-correlated subquery expressions.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue. It now doesn't skip `Subquery`, and subquery expressions will be handled by `OptimizeSubqueries`, which runs the optimizer with the subquery.\r\n\r\nNote that, correlated subquery expressions will be handled twice: once in `OptimizeSubqueries`, once later when it becomes join. This is OK as `NormalizeFloatingNumbers` is idempotent now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix a bug\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, see the newly added test.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28695 , to fix the problem completely.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that, `df(\"col\").as(\"name\")` is not a column reference anymore, and should not have the special column metadata. However, this was broken in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/ba7adc494923de8104ab37d412edd78afe540f45#diff-ac415c903887e49486ba542a65eec980L1050-L1053\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the regression, by strip the special column metadata in `Column.name`, which is the behavior before https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28326 . \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a regression. We shouldn't fail if there is no ambiguous self-join.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the query in the test can run now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt happends when hash aggregate downgrades to sort based aggregate. \r\n`UnsafeExternalSorter.createWithExistingInMemorySorter` calls `spill` on an `InMemorySorter` immediately, but the memory pointed by InMemorySorter is acquired by outside `BytesToBytesMap`, instead the `allocatedPages` in `UnsafeExternalSorter`. So the memory spill bytes metric is always 0, but disk bytes spill metric is right. \r\n\r\nRelated code is at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/util/collection/unsafe/sort/UnsafeExternalSorter.java#L232.\r\n\r\nIt can be reproduced by following step.\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-shell --driver-memory 512m --executor-memory 512m --executor-cores 1 --conf \"spark.default.parallelism=1\"\r\nscala> sql(\"select id, count(1) from range(10000000) group by id\").write.csv(\"/tmp/result.json\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, the metric

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to extract SQL keywords (`allCandidateKeywords` in `TableIdentifierParserSuite`) from the generated parser class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt is hard to maintain a full set of SQL keywords in `TableIdentifierParserSuite`, so it would be nice if we could update `allCandidateKeywords` automatically. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2020-06-10T07:48:34Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T15:59:15Z","closed_at":"2020-06-11T15:59:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d85890fbf5c7e87758907e45c7782c08470b2f0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28779/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28779/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28779/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4f417d1fd3686129c6151310442e92a96faa647","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-31950","ref":"SPARK-31950","sha":"e4f417d1fd3686129c6151310442e92a96faa647","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is another approach to fix the issue. See the previous try https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28745. It was too invasive so I took more conservative approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to resolve grouping attributes separately first so it can be properly referred when `FlatMapGroupsInPandas` and `FlatMapCoGroupsInPandas` are resolved without ambiguity.\r\n\r\nPreviously, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([[1, 1]], [\"column\", \"Score\"])\r\n@pandas_udf(\"column integer, Score float\", PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP)\r\ndef my_pandas_udf(pdf):\r\n    return pdf.assign(Score=0.5)\r\n\r\ndf.groupby('COLUMN').apply(my_pandas_udf).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwas failed as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: \"Reference 'COLUMN' is ambiguous, could be: COLUMN, COLUMN.;\"\r\n```\r\nbecause the unresolved `COLUMN` in `FlatMapGroupsInPandas` doesn't know which reference to take from the child projection.\r\n\r\nAfter this fix, it resolves the child projection first with grouping keys and pass, to `FlatMapGroupsInPandas`, the attribute as a grouping key from the child projection that is positionally selected.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo resolve grouping keys correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([[1, 1]], [\"column\", \"Score\"])\r\n@pandas_udf(\"column integer, Score float\", PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP)\r\ndef my_pandas_udf(pdf):\r\n    return pdf.assign(Score=0.5)\r\n\r\ndf.groupby('COLUMN').apply(my_pandas_udf).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf1 = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 1)], (\"column\", \"value\"))\r\ndf2 = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 1)], (\"column\", \"value\"))\r\n\r\ndf1.groupby(\"COLUMN\").cogroup(\r\n    df2.groupby(\"COLUMN\")\r\n).applyInPandas(lambda r, l: r + l, df1.schema).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: Reference 'COLUMN' is ambiguous, could be: COLUMN, COLUMN.;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '`COLUMN`' given input columns: [COLUMN, COLUMN, value, value];;\r\n'FlatMapCoGroupsInPandas ['COLUMN], ['COLUMN],

[COLUMN#13L, column#13L, value#14L]\r\n   +- LogicalRDD [column#13L, value#14L], false\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+------+-----+\r\n|column|Score|\r\n+------+-----+\r\n|     1|

added and manually tested.","created_at":"2020-06-10T07:35:29Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:28Z","closed_at":"2020-06-10T22:54:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"00df42cc2e5f4ca3288960cc7511f6b902c6b61e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28777/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28777/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28777/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c656ddb03d56a59a02c6b6c38a731475625a38fc","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-31915-another","ref":"SPARK-31915-another","sha":"c656ddb03d56a59a02c6b6c38a731475625a38fc","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMkae Hadoop file system config effective in data source options.\r\n\r\nFrom `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.java`:\r\n```\r\n  public static FileSystem get(URI uri, Configuration conf) throws IOException {\r\n    String scheme = uri.getScheme();\r\n    String authority = uri.getAuthority();\r\n\r\n    if (scheme == null && authority == null) {     // use default FS\r\n      return get(conf);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (scheme != null && authority == null) {     // no authority\r\n      URI defaultUri = getDefaultUri(conf);\r\n      if (scheme.equals(defaultUri.getScheme())    // if scheme matches default\r\n          && defaultUri.getAuthority() != null) {  // & default has authority\r\n        return get(defaultUri, conf);              // return default\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    String disableCacheName = String.format(\"fs.%s.impl.disable.cache\", scheme);\r\n    if (conf.getBoolean(disableCacheName, false)) {\r\n      return createFileSystem(uri, conf);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return CACHE.get(uri, conf);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nBefore changes, the file system configurations in data source options are not propagated in `DataSource.scala`.\r\nAfter changes, we can specify authority and URI schema related configurations for scanning file systems.\r\n\r\nThis problem only exists in data source V1. In V2, we already use `sparkSession.sessionState.newHadoopConfWithOptions(options)` in `FileTable`.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAllow users to specify authority and URI schema related Hadoop configurations for file source reading.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the file system related Hadoop configuration in data source option will be effective on reading.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make `PythonFunction` holds `Seq[Byte]` instead of `Array[Byte]` to be able to compare if the byte array has the same values for the cache manager.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently the cache manager doesn't use the cache for `udf` if the `udf` is created again even if the functions is the same.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> func = lambda x: x\r\n\r\n>>> df = spark.range(1)\r\n>>> df.select(udf(func)(\"id\")).cache()\r\n```\r\n```py\r\n>>> df.select(udf(func)(\"id\")).explain()\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(2) Project [pythonUDF0#14 AS <lambda>(id)#12]\r\n+- BatchEvalPython [<lambda>(id#0L)], [pythonUDF0#14]\r\n +- *(1) Range (0, 1, step=1, splits=12)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `PythonFunction` holds `Array[Byte]`, and `equals` method of array equals only when the both array is the same instance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, if the user reuse the Python function for the UDF, the cache manager will detect the same function and use the cache for it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a test case and manually.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df.select(udf(func)(\"id\")).explain()\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nInMemoryTableScan [<lambda>(id)#12]\r\n   +- InMemoryRelation [<lambda>(id)#12], StorageLevel(disk,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake Hadoop file system config effective in data source options.\r\n\r\nFrom `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.java`:\r\n```\r\n  public static FileSystem get(URI uri, Configuration conf) throws IOException {\r\n    String scheme = uri.getScheme();\r\n    String authority = uri.getAuthority();\r\n\r\n    if (scheme == null && authority == null) {     // use default FS\r\n      return get(conf);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (scheme != null && authority == null) {     // no authority\r\n      URI defaultUri = getDefaultUri(conf);\r\n      if (scheme.equals(defaultUri.getScheme())    // if scheme matches default\r\n          && defaultUri.getAuthority() != null) {  // & default has authority\r\n        return get(defaultUri, conf);              // return default\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    String disableCacheName = String.format(\"fs.%s.impl.disable.cache\", scheme);\r\n    if (conf.getBoolean(disableCacheName, false)) {\r\n      return createFileSystem(uri, conf);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return CACHE.get(uri, conf);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nBefore changes, the file system configurations in data source options are not propagated in `DataSource.scala`.\r\nAfter changes, we can specify authority and URI schema related configurations for scanning file systems.\r\n\r\nThis problem only exists in data source V1. In V2, we already use `sparkSession.sessionState.newHadoopConfWithOptions(options)` in `FileTable`.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAllow users to specify authority and URI schema related Hadoop configurations for file source reading.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the file system related Hadoop configuration in data source option will be effective on reading.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis pull request would prevent JNI resources leaking from Level DB instance and its' iterators. In before implementation JNI resources from LevelDBIterator are cleaned by finalize() function. This behavior is also mentioned in comments of [\"LevelDBIterator.java\"](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/common/kvstore/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/util/kvstore/LevelDBIterator.java) by @squito . But if DB instance is already closed, then iterator's close method would be ignored. LevelDB's iterator would keep level db files opened (for the case table cache is filled up), till iterator.close() is called. Then these JNI resources (file handle) would be leaked.\r\nThis JNI resource leaking issue would cause the problem described in [SPARK-31929](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31929) on Windows: in spark history server, leaked file handle for level db files would trigger \"IOException\" when HistoryServerDiskManager try to remove them for releasing disk space.\r\n![IOException](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/84134659-7c388680-aa7b-11ea-807f-04dcfa7886a0.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd unit test and manually tested it.","created_at":"2020-06-09T10:04:17Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T01:13:38Z","closed_at":"2020-06-16T18:00:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a36780d6b79669f975d86c6cfd98ca2e3b7fc2c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9bcc084160021dd9a7dc1d573b787075016e9f01","head":{"label":"zhli1142015:close-leveldbiterator-when-leveldb.close","ref":"close-leveldbiterator-when-leveldb.close","sha":"9bcc084160021dd9a7dc1d573b787075016e9f01","user":{"login":"zhli1142015","id":10524738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI0NzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10524738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015","html_url":"https://github.com/zhli1142015","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270605486,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA2MDU0ODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"zhli1142015/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhli1142015","id":10524738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI0NzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10524738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015","html_url":"https://github.com/zhli1142015","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhli1142015/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhli1142015/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter SPARK-31632 SparkException is thrown from def applicationInfo\r\n`def applicationInfo(): v1.ApplicationInfo = {\r\n    try {\r\n      // The ApplicationInfo may not be available when Spark is starting up.\r\n      store.view(classOf[ApplicationInfoWrapper]).max(1).iterator().next().info\r\n    } catch {\r\n      case _: NoSuchElementException =>\r\n        throw new SparkException(\"Failed to get the application information. \" +\r\n          \"If you are starting up Spark, please wait a while until it's ready.\")\r\n    }\r\n  }`\r\n\r\nWhere as the caller for this method def getSparkUser in Spark UI is not handling SparkException in the catch\r\n\r\n`def getSparkUser: String = {\r\n    try {\r\n      Option(store.applicationInfo().attempts.head.sparkUser)\r\n        .orElse(store.environmentInfo().systemProperties.toMap.get(\"user.name\"))\r\n        .getOrElse(\"<unknown>\")\r\n    } catch {\r\n      case _: NoSuchElementException => \"<unknown>\"\r\n    }\r\n  }`\r\n\r\nSo On using this method (getSparkUser )we can get the application erred out.\r\n\r\nAs the part of this PR we will replace SparkException to NoSuchElementException for applicationInfo in AppStatusStore\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOn invoking the method getSparkUser, we can get the SparkException on calling store.applicationInfo(). And this is not handled in the catch block and getSparkUser will error out in this scenario\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nDone the manual testing using the spark-shell and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate comments for `DateTimeUtils`.`toJavaDate` and `fromJavaDate`, and for the legacy date formatters `LegacySimpleDateFormatter` and `LegacyFastDateFormatter` regarding to the default JVM time zone. The comments say that the default JVM time zone is used intentionally for backward compatibility with Spark 2.4 and earlier versions.\r\n\r\nCloses #28709\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo document current behaviour of related methods in `DateTimeUtils` and the legacy date formatters. For example, correctness of `HiveResult.hiveResultString` and `toHiveString` is directly related to the same time zone used by `toJavaDate` and `LegacyFastDateFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the Scala style checker

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-28199 (#24996) made the trigger related public API to be exposed only from static methods of Trigger class. This is backward incompatible change, so some users may experience compilation error after upgrading to Spark 3.0.0.\r\n\r\nWhile we plan to mention the change into release note, it's good to mention the change to the migration guide doc as well, since the purpose of the doc is to collect the major changes/incompatibilities between versions and end users would refer the doc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-28199 is technically backward incompatible change and we should kindly guide the change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nDoc change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A, as it's just a doc change.","created_at":"2020-06-09T03:14:02Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T13:22:14Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T04:53:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0cf7166a5e04ce66adc91c749196dbe7647cccdc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fcbabf9c973dfdb51c571f95b73abbc4b12dae36","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-28199-FOLLOWUP-doc","ref":"SPARK-28199-FOLLOWUP-doc","sha":"fcbabf9c973dfdb51c571f95b73abbc4b12dae36","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix wordings in the Python UDF exception error message from:\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\n\r\n> An exception was thrown from Python worker in the executor. The below is the Python worker stacktrace.\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n> An exception was thrown from the Python worker. Please see the stack trace below.\r\n\r\nIt removes \"executor\" because Python worker is technically a separate process, and remove the duplicated wording \"Python worker\" .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo give users better exception messages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's in unreleased branches only. If RC3 passes, yes, it will change the exception message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.","created_at":"2020-06-09T00:51:06Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:30Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T01:24:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ab243c33599e516aeb8dc732b934ca5f6ad6927","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9eb69c0273c0c4ae3eec1732e00c509d8b01ea6c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-31849-followup-2","ref":"SPARK-31849-followup-2","sha":"9eb69c0273c0c4ae3eec1732e00c509d8b01ea6c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMkae Hadoop file system config effective in data source options.\r\n\r\nFrom `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.java`:\r\n```\r\n  public static FileSystem get(URI uri, Configuration conf) throws IOException {\r\n    String scheme = uri.getScheme();\r\n    String authority = uri.getAuthority();\r\n\r\n    if (scheme == null && authority == null) {     // use default FS\r\n      return get(conf);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (scheme != null && authority == null) {     // no authority\r\n      URI defaultUri = getDefaultUri(conf);\r\n      if (scheme.equals(defaultUri.getScheme())    // if scheme matches default\r\n          && defaultUri.getAuthority() != null) {  // & default has authority\r\n        return get(defaultUri, conf);              // return default\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    String disableCacheName = String.format(\"fs.%s.impl.disable.cache\", scheme);\r\n    if (conf.getBoolean(disableCacheName, false)) {\r\n      return createFileSystem(uri, conf);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return CACHE.get(uri, conf);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nBefore changes, the file system configurations in data source options are not propagated in `DataSource.scala`.\r\nAfter changes, we can specify authority and URI schema related configurations for scanning file systems.\r\n\r\nThis problem only exists in data source V1. In V2, we already use `sparkSession.sessionState.newHadoopConfWithOptions(options)` in `FileTable`.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAllow users to specify authority and URI schema related Hadoop configurations for file source reading.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the file system related Hadoop configuration in data source option will be effective on reading.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of #26624. This PR cleans up MDC properties if the original value is empty.\r\nBesides, this PR adds a warning and ignore the value when the user tries to override the value of `taskName`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, running the following jobs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsc.setLocalProperty(\"mdc.my\", \"ABC\")\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100).count()\r\nsc.setLocalProperty(\"mdc.my\", null)\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100).count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nthere's still MDC value \"ABC\" in the log of the second count job even if we've unset the value. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, user will 1) no longer see the MDC values after unsetting the value; 2) see a warning if he/she tries to override the value of `taskName`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdate the Fabric8 Kubernetes client to the latest release to support Kubernetes version 1.18 (and 1.17) in Spark 2.4.x.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nKubernetes 1.16 will fall out of support after the next Kubernetes release (which is probably going to be released this summer), so Kubernetes cluster maintainers will want to upgrade their clusters past it. However, the current Spark 2.4.x version can't function in Kubernetes clusters with version higher than 1.16 without upgrading the Kubernetes client.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsing standard `dev/run-tests` script and by executing a demo job in Minikube. Steps for executing in Minikube:\r\n\r\n1. Create a Minikube cluster.\r\n2. Build the project using Maven with Kubernetes support.\r\n3. Build the Docker images using `bin/docker-image-tool.sh` with `-m` flag.\r\n4. Create a namespace and a service account for Spark.\r\n5. Submit a Spark job in the cluster:\r\n    ```\r\n    ./bin/spark-submit  \\\r\n    --master \"k8s://https://$(minikube ip):8443\" \\\r\n    --name demo \\\r\n    --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n    --conf spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.name=demo-driver \\\r\n    --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=spark \\\r\n    --conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName=spark \\\r\n    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=spark-py:latest \\\r\n    --conf spark.kubernetes.driver.limit.cores=2 \\\r\n    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image.pullPolicy=Never \\\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn #28485 pagination support for tables of Structured Streaming Tab was added. \r\nIt missed 2 things:\r\n* For sorting duration column, `String` was used which sometimes gives wrong results(consider `\"3 ms\"` and `\"12 ms\"`). Now we first sort the duration column and then convert it to readable String\r\n* Status column was not made sortable. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the wrong result for sorting and making Status column sortable.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAfter changes:\r\n<img width=\"1677\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-08 at 2 18 48 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15366835/84010992-153fa280-a993-11ea-9846-bf176f2ec5d7.png\">\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen` org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.HiveThriftServer2#startWithContext` called,\r\nit starts `ThriftCLIService` in the background with a new Thread, at the same time we call `ThriftCLIService.getPortNumber,` we might not get the bound port if it's configured with 0.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the  TServer/HttpServer initialization code out of that new Thread. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix concurrency issue, improve test robustness.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nNO\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the useless projection in grouped and co-grouped UDFs, which can cause the analysis failure when the grouping column is specified with different upper-lower cases compared to the one specified in the return schema.\r\n\r\nCurrently, projection is initially added in grouped and cogrouped pandas UDFs to keep the grouping keys. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([[1, 1]], [\"column\", \"Score\"])\r\n@pandas_udf(\"column integer, Score float\", PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP)\r\ndef my_pandas_udf(pdf):\r\n    return pdf.assign(Score=0.5)\r\n\r\ndf.groupby('COLUMN').apply(my_pandas_udf).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nadds a projection that includes the grouping keys:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'FlatMapGroupsInPandas ['COLUMN], my_pandas_udf(COLUMN#166L, Score#167L), [COLUMN#193, Score#194]\r\n+- 'Project ['COLUMN, column#166L, Score#167L]  # <---- Here\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich later causes the reference resolution failure:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: \"Reference 'COLUMN' is ambiguous, could be: COLUMN, COLUMN.;\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, we don't need to add the grouping keys at all because grouped and co-grouped pandas UDFs _always_ require to take _all_ columns as input pandas UDF.\r\n\r\nAfter this fix, it will be as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'FlatMapGroupsInPandas ['COLUMN], my_pandas_udf(column#0L, Score#1L), [column#9, Score#10]\r\n+- LogicalRDD [column#0L, Score#1L], false\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we'll still add projection in case of non-deterministic grouping expressions to avoid to evaluate it multiple times which ends up with a different result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change will fix two things:\r\n- Implementation consistency w.t.r other grouping expressions.\r\n- A bug related to the case sensitivity, see below.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([[1, 1]], [\"column\", \"Score\"])\r\n@pandas_udf(\"column integer, Score float\", PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP)\r\ndef my_pandas_udf(pdf):\r\n    return pdf.assign(Score=0.5)\r\n\r\ndf.groupby('COLUMN').apply(my_pandas_udf).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf1 = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 1)], (\"column\", \"value\"))\r\ndf2 = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 1)], (\"column\", \"value\"))\r\n\r\ndf1.groupby(\"COLUMN\").cogroup(\r\n    df2.groupby(\"COLUMN\")\r\n).applyInPandas(lambda r, l: r + l, df1.schema).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: Reference 'COLUMN' is ambiguous, could be: COLUMN, COLUMN.;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '`COLUMN`' given input columns: [COLUMN, COLUMN, value, value];;\r\n'FlatMapCoGroupsInPandas ['COLUMN], ['COLUMN],
