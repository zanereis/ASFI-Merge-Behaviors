CassandraIO source into multiple sources works fast as it uses one connection pool to Cassandra cluster but after that dataflow.worker.WorkerCustomSources is calling CassandraSource.getEstimatedSizeBytes for each source which setups and tears down connection to Cassandra cluster to calculate same size of table. This optimization introduces caching of size internally just to avoid additional queries. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The logging implied a failure of the state requests right before the\r\nnetwork split. However, the opposite is true, the failure occured during\r\nshutdown of the pipeline where the state request handler has already been removed.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n========\r\n\r\nEnsure that we shutdown the environment and any pending clients which may be\r\nprocessing pending requests.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

this moment Custom Source in being split and serialized in sequence. If there are many splits, it takes time to process all splits. \r\n\r\nExample: it takes 2s to calculate size and serialize CassandraSource due to connection setup and teardown. With 100+ splits, it's a lot of time spent in 1 worker. \r\n\r\nThis change introduces paralleism to creation of all DerivedSources, including calculation of size.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds yapf configuration and all the changes made after running it over the entire Python SDK codebase.\r\nThe result is fully compliant with PEP8 (lint check passes, the issues were manually resolved).\r\n\r\nSome of the examples and rules of the newly enforced style (they can be put under discussion and reviewed):\r\n* Multiple dict entries can be put in the same line. \r\nbefore:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b689fffa4afcc3b655e1c831d10303b2c89b43dd/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/avroio_test.py#L72-L91\r\nafter:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/cfa903402e9dd0213e5d837722ce22800c4669f3/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/avroio_test.py#L71-L76\r\nWith this setting, it seems the result conforms more to the already used style (lower number of lines changed).\r\n\r\n* Yapf tries to put the first parameter on the same line where the function begins:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/cfa903402e9dd0213e5d837722ce22800c4669f3/sdks/python/apache_beam/utils/annotations_test.py#L56-L61\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/cfa903402e9dd0213e5d837722ce22800c4669f3/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery.py#L398-L407\r\n\r\n...unless some of parameters have type annotation or are too long (then it does the split before the first argument):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/cfa903402e9dd0213e5d837722ce22800c4669f3/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/direct/watermark_manager.py#L129-L136\r\n\r\nIndent width is 2 and

a rule in Go, one shouldn't worry about correctly picking the capacity of a slice and relying just on append to grow the slice in necessary. The exception is when we already know the size in advance.\r\n\r\nFor both the ordinary fixed sized iterators and the multi-chunked ones, we know the size of a buffer in advance and can avoid the grow+copy costs. In multi-chunked ones, we don't know the total size, but we should avoid the cost of the intermediate growth of the the temporary slice.\r\n\r\nPerforming this optimization since it showed up in a job as %2 of the overall job cost in a CPU profile.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This allows for the removal of the per layer locks and the global lock that needed to be checked since all bundles had to check the same datastore. Now they only store a metric cell in the global store on first creation (still stored per bundle and per ptransform).\r\n\r\nA subsequent change will remove the global store altogether in favour of better exposing the metrics per bundle, and allowing a callback visitor to thread-safely access the data inside each metric. This will also permit removing the dependency on the protos from the package, which was a mistake I made when I first wrote the package.\r\n\r\nFurther, Counters now use atomic operations rather than locks, which additional speeds them up vs the previous mutex approach.\r\n\r\nCounter \"names\" are hashed ahead of time and the hash value cached in the proxy to increase the speed of subsequent lookups using the same proxy object.\r\n\r\nThis does make the proxies unsafe to use concurrently within the same bundle prior to first use, but this matches the general rule of Beam runners managing the concurrency for efficient processing, and that framework constructs are not safe for concurrent use by user code, without user managed locks.\r\n\r\nAs an exploration, I did try using sync.Map to avoid the above restriction, but the overhead for the additional interface wraping and unwraping was significant enough that this approach was worthwhile. \r\nThis may be worth revisiting if Go gains Generics, as that would probably avoid this cost.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the DoFnOperator and the subclassed ExecutableStageDoFnOperator there are\r\neffectively two processing threads:\r\n\r\n(1) The main processing thread for processing elements and watermarks\r\n(2) A timer thread to support ending bundles after a timeout to optimize for\r\nlatency\r\n\r\nAlthough the code was written with a different assumption in the past, the two\r\nthreads do not interleave with each other. Only one is active at a time. This is\r\nensured by Flink's \"checkpointLock\" which is acquired for every method called on\r\nthe operator like processElement, processWatermark, snapshotState. It is also\r\nacquired when timers are fired which are set using Flink's TimeService, like it\r\nis the case for (2).\r\n\r\nWe've seen issues with bundles being closed multiple times resulting in\r\nexceptions like \"Already closed\". Very rarely, we've also seen dead bundle ids\r\nresurecting for which no other explanation could be found than an inconsistent\r\nview of the two threads.\r\n\r\nThis is why this PR makes the fields volatile which are accessed by both\r\nthreads. We do not have to synchronize as explained above. We remove the\r\nAtomicBool for the bundle state because it is not necessary, a volatile bool\r\nsuffices.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
