PR adds the ability to use a file on disk to provide a JWT for the TrinoHook, as opposed to placing the JWT directly into the connection definition. In our use case, we'd like to use a kubernetes projected volume to make JWT's available to airflow. This does not automatically update the connection definition when the token is rotated, however, and it would be easier to simply have airflow read the JWT from disk when using the TrinoHook.\r\n\r\nA JWT file is used when the `jwt__file` parameter is given in the extras section.","created_at":"2023-06-16T00:04:47Z","updated_at":"2023-06-24T16:32:51Z","closed_at":"2023-06-24T16:32:48Z","merged_at":"2023-06-24T16:32:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"371833e076d033be84f109cce980a6275032833c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5009481047,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABKpadVw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:trino","name":"provider:trino","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/31950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/31950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/31950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/cc50e5e25ef300914576cf50024bd2890c8c52cf","head":{"label":"jhbigler:main","ref":"main","sha":"cc50e5e25ef300914576cf50024bd2890c8c52cf","user":{"login":"jhbigler","id":28834755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODM0NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28834755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler","html_url":"https://github.com/jhbigler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":653360232,"node_id":"R_kgDOJvF8aA","name":"airflow","full_name":"jhbigler/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jhbigler","id":28834755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODM0NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28834755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler","html_url":"https://github.com/jhbigler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhbigler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jhbigler/airflow","description":"Apache

constraints and custom depenencies are a mystery for our users. The reason why we are using constraints is not clear and user are confused when they should and when they shoudl not use constraints. Recent discussions with users and \"Mastering Custom Dependencies\" presentation in London has proven that we need to do better and simplify the documentation while giving more, better examples. That includes trimming down of boilerplate description in the constraint information, explaining a little more on what reproducibke (not repeatable!) build is, adding expectation that users will not use constraints for all pip commands and explaining how to produce your own constraints if you need a reproducible, custom build.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fulfill those goals.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

shell and start-airflow commands started to have more options and the \"advanced\" flags became a bag of everything. This change groups the options in more logical groups at help screen. The option groups are also logically sequenced, they basically reflect things as they are happening:\r\n\r\n* first user selects what integration/backends/python to use\r\n* then executor\r\n* then - if options are selected - image gets rebuild with options before shell is entered\r\n* then sources/mypy-volume get mounted\r\n* then - if options are selected - packages are possibly installed inside the image\r\n\r\nIt should make it easier to understand what's going on and which options to choose.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

pod security context (`.Values.securityContexts.pod` parameter) is not propagated to statsd deployment when statsd security context is not specified. However at the same time container security context is propagated(`.Values.securityContexts.containers` parameter). According to documentation looks like it should be propagated, see https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/chart/values.schema.json#L4806 and https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/chart/values.yaml#L1588 . I think it would be convinient to be able to propagate global security context to statsd deployment, so instead of changing documentation I added the propagation of global pod security context to statsd deployment.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31725\r\n\r\n**Objective**\r\nThis PR adds OpenTelemetry support for timer metrics.  With this merged, OTel and StatsD support should be at feature parity.\r\n\r\n** Testing**\r\nPasses `breeze testing tests` and `breeze static-checks` locally.  I have added unit tests for both new methods and these can also be manually tested by launching Breeze with `breeze start-airflow --integration otel` if anyone wants to check it out.

Overview\r\n\r\nThe `DbApiHook.run` method has incredibly complex typing, which is currently reduced to just the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def run(\r\n        self,\r\n        sql: str | Iterable[str],\r\n        autocommit: bool = False,\r\n        parameters: Iterable | Mapping | None = None,\r\n        handler: Callable | None = None,\r\n        split_statements: bool = True,\r\n        return_last: bool = True,\r\n    ) -> Any | list[Any] | None:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is incomplete typing for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- Some of the `bool`s in the kwargs determine the return type.\r\n- Whether the `handler` is `None` determines whether the return type is `None`.\r\n- The return type of the `handler` is generic and determines the return type of the `run` method.\r\n\r\nAddressing the first bullet point would be a bit of work, and would add a lot of complicated typing to each provider hook.\r\n\r\nBut I figured addressing the 2nd and 3rd bullet points was easy and takes just 2 overloads. This alone helps vastly improve the typing of of the `DbApiHook.run` method with a minimal amount of added annotation complexity.\r\n\r\n# Misc.\r\n\r\n- I do not anticipate that this should cause any backwards compatibility concerns except for users who meet all the following criteria:\r\n   - (1) they are relying on the `DbiApiHook` directly, (2) they are using mypy or another type checker, and (3) they had type checking issues that were not being properly flagged before due to the less precise typing.\r\n   - This may also cause users' IDEs to get upset at them if they have a function that looks like this as a handler, even though it would technically work. This is probably fine to flag to users, even if it works, since the only reason it works is by ignoring the kwargs entirely.\r\n   ```python\r\n   # This works as a handler because `handler(cursor)` is a valid input, and `foo` is ignored.\r\n   def handler(cursor, foo=None):\r\n   ```\r\n- I did not open an issue because the issues template for feature requests says:\r\n    > Features should be small improvements that do not dramatically change Airflow assumptions. Note, that in this case you do not even need to create an issue if you have a code change ready to submit! You can open [Pull Request](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pulls) immediately

recent version of pytest released on June 10th introduced change that it will read conftest tests starting in the directory which is current working directory, this causes breeze tests run with working directory being top airflow directory to fail because it's requirements do not contain a few libraries that are used in airflow's conftest.py\r\n\r\nThis change rather than specifying

a bunch of problems around the ECS run task operator:\r\n\r\n- it was checking for task status even when we were not waiting for completion, which would result in a failure if the check happens fast enough because the task would still be pending\r\n- added a warning about trying to pull logs and not waiting for completion, which is just a weird thing to do, because logs might be truncated, they might not even be there yet. I'm assuming it was always undefined behavior, so I'm going ahead and not even starting the thread if wait for completion is false.\r\n- added a log when logs are not present (yet) so that if the issue persists, users have a message guiding them towards resolution rather than complete silence\r\n\r\nThe system tests were not properly configured for logs too. I added the necessary configuration, a cleanup step, and moved the sensor to ecs_fargate so that we can have the normal behavior querying logs in the vanilla ecs test.","created_at":"2023-06-11T00:51:33Z","updated_at":"2023-06-16T19:28:59Z","closed_at":"2023-06-16T19:22:25Z","merged_at":"2023-06-16T19:22:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0f21f43c63b13fd48f55aa660746edc37df1458","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

should generate machine-readable SBOM information for our users to consume, therefore we need to have an automated process to generate dependency information.

I resurrected this PR from the dustbin @eladkal & @potiuk.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is add two standardized \"todo\" directives that will allow us to essentially set a reminder to make certain code changes at provider release time.\r\n\r\nIt adds a new section to the github issue template:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFound providers with todos which should be addressed now. There are two classes of such todos. One is when the provider version is nowgreater than that specified in comment. The other is when the\r\ncurrent min airflow version for the provider is greaterthan specified in the comment.\r\n\r\n## apache-airflow-providers-elasticsearch\r\n### remove-on-provider-version\r\n  - [ ] airflow/providers/elasticsearch/log/es_task_handler.py:169 (@dstandish)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is achieved with two different todo directives:\r\n\r\nOne of them is about min airflow version:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# todo: remove-on-min-airflow-version=2.6 author=dstandish\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you add this, you'll get tagged when the new release bumps the min airflow version to 2.6 in that provider.\r\n\r\nThe other one is about provider version:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# todo: remove-on-provider-version=7.0 author=dstandish\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this one, I'll get notified at release time when provider version is bumped to 7.0.\r\n\r\nThis feels like a relatively simple enhancement that could help us remember to remove things.  And it is responsive to the concern that provider manager should not be blocked if the person who added the tag doesn't respond.\r\n\r\nThe \"author\" element is optional.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think","created_at":"2023-06-10T09:03:17Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T00:12:35Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T00:12:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca6311b7c738d2edf7e17e845b05ac191a94e383","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\ncloses https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/16163\r\n\r\n### __WARNING:__ we need to test/discuss the implications of this change before merging!\r\n\r\n## What is this PR changing?\r\n\r\nThis PR very simply changes the [celery config named `task_acks_late`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#task-acks-late) from `True` to `False`.\r\n\r\nThe basic meaning of this config is:\r\n\r\n- `task_acks_late=True`: celery workers [acknowledge tasks LATE](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/glossary.html#term-late-acknowledgment), AFTER they finish running\r\n- `task_acks_late=False`: celery workers [acknowledge tasks EARLY](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/glossary.html#term-early-acknowledgment), just BEFORE they start running\r\n\r\n## What's the problem?\r\n\r\nWhat's the problem with the behavior of `task_acks_late=True`?\r\n\r\nEffectively it makes Celery re-assign long-running task instances, specifically, ones that take more than [`visibility_timeout`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/4.4.2/getting-started/brokers/redis.html#visibility-timeout) seconds (even if they are still happily running on another worker). This results in some strange behavior as reported in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/16163\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, we get two of a single task instance running concurrently. The new instance will realize the old task is still running, and will correctly wait. But now, the Airflow UI will only show the logs for this new \"phantom task\", which will always be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{taskinstance.py:874} INFO - Dependencies not met for <TaskInstance: ... [running]>, dependency 'Task Instance Not Running' FAILED: Task is in the running state\r\n{taskinstance.py:874} INFO - Dependencies not met for <TaskInstance: ... [running]>, dependency 'Task Instance State' FAILED: Task is in the 'running' state which is not a valid state for execution. The task must be cleared in order to be run.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why will this fix it?\r\n\r\nFirst, it's important to understand that celery tasks are NOT airflow tasks:\r\n\r\n- `\"celery task\"`: are like a \"transport layer\" from the airflow scheduler's perspective, in that the scheduler creates a celery task for each \"try\" of an airflow task instance (when configured to use the [`CeleryExecutor`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/executor/celery.html))\r\n- `\"airflow task instance\"`: are the [concept we all know](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/tasks.html#task-instances)\r\n\r\nThe airflow scheduler is already designed to handle [\"zombie\" task instances](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/tasks.html#zombie-undead-tasks) by killing task instances that don't \"heartbeat\" at least once in a period ([`300` seconds, by default](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#scheduler-zombie-task-threshold)), so we don't want celery taking matters into its own hands.\r\n\r\n## Other Thoughts\r\n\r\nWith this change, `visibility_timeout` becomes effectively irrelevant (as long as it's larger than the `scheduler_zombie_task_threshold`), so we might want to remove the [`AIRFLOW__SCHEDULER__SCHEDULER_ZOMBIE_TASK_THRESHOLD`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#scheduler-zombie-task-threshold) config, and set it to some very high value.\r\n\r\n- Alternatively, if we set `visibility_timeout` to a number lower than `scheduler_zombie_task_threshold`, there might be cases where a task instance \"retry\" is avoided (like when a worker crashes), but it would also introduce the risk of two tasks instances running concurrently again\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

#31704 introduced limit for MSSQL tests to run maximum 1 test in parallel for public runners, and used the number of CPUS to determine parallelism for self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\nHowever, the selective check runs on the public runners now, so it will set the parallelism to 2 because this is the number of CPUS the public runners have.\r\n\r\nSince we know that our self-hosted runners have 8 CPUS, we should rather hard-code the parallelism to 8 in this case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
