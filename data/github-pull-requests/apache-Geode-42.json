Now its possible to define the size unit that will be used, in the `DiskStoreFactory` class. So if the sizes that will be introduced should be treated as bytes, its possible to change the unit before creating the disk store.

My only concern here is that if `incLong` fails, the metric will forever be out of sync with the `AtomicLong` field.\r\n\r\n- still trying to figure out what multi-threaded tests look like. @dschneider-pivotal referenced some files to look at, but I don't know if those need to be written just yet. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

After all int stats are converted to long stats (in a separate PR), we will remove the ability to bind to int stats.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

OsStatisticsProvider.build() will no longer throw an IllegalStateException if the operating system is not  a well known one. We want Geode to work on any OS that java supports.

key change here is the change in CMS method signatures from \r\n\r\n`<T extends CacheElement & RespondsWith<R>, R extends CacheElement> ClusterManagementResult<R> ...`\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n`<T extends RestfulEndpoint & RespondsWith<R>, R extends CMSJsonSerializable> ClusterManagementResult<R> ...`\r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of `CacheElement` have been decomposed into interfaces `Groupable`, `RestfulEndpoint`, and `CMSJsonSerializable`.  This allows certain methods that previously required CacheElement to now only require the specific aspect(s) that are relevant, and allows future CMS API's the flexibility to use whatever base class they want, which may not be CacheElement for request or response types that don't map neatly to cache.xml\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n\r\n1. This is an exercise to see what it would look like if we didn't require every request and response to extend CacheElement.  In practice maybe extending CacheElement is no problem (i.e. we could just add new APIs to CMS to handle anything that doesn't, e.g. Rebalance).  So, a discussion that results in closing this PR without merging is also a perfectly acceptable outcome.\r\n\r\n2. This PR builds on PR #3708 (which is not yet merged to develop).  Ignore the first 11 commits and start from the first GEODE-6869 commit comment to see just the intended changeset).  Once that PR is merged I'll rebase this one so it's easier to review.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-16T06:20:26Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T17:11:57Z","closed_at":"2019-06-18T17:11:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"08c4fb737364deabd9e1d7ce3f4dd24d06fd8433","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/1eda23f19acfe0cda2f258196981c817fbad2907","head":{"label":"onichols-pivotal:GEODE-6869-decouple-cms-response-type","ref":"GEODE-6869-decouple-cms-response-type","sha":"1eda23f19acfe0cda2f258196981c817fbad2907","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114800905,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4MDA5MDU=","name":"geode","full_name":"onichols-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

is exactly the same as #3544 except that now the check method logs a warning instead of throwing an exception. If you look at the commit history only the revisions since the merge on June 12th changed since the previous review some of you did.\r\n\r\nThrowing an exception led to inconsistency because the operation made it into the region but not into the gateway sender or async event queue.\r\nOnce the warning is logged for a region it will not be logged again until a check is done that finds that the ids are consistent.\r\nI had both the initial message (that the ids differ) and the subsequent message (that they are now consistent) both be logged as warnings so that if you see the first message you will also see the second.\r\nIf we logged the \"everything is ok\" at info level, then it is possible that they would only see the warning.\r\n\r\nI thought it was best to at least have this log message instead of completely removing the check. It may help diagnose a case in the future when someone dynamically adds a gateway sender inconsistently.\r\n\r\nI am still trying to figure out how to validate that the new warning log messages are in

is exactly the same as https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3544 except that now the check method logs a warning instead of throwing an exception.\r\nThrowing an exception led to inconsistency because the operation made it into the region but not into the gateway sender.\r\nOnce the warning is logged for a region it will not be logged again until a check is done that finds that the ids are consistent.\r\nI had both the initial message (that the ids differ) and the subsequent message (that they are now consistent) both be logged as warnings so that if you see the first message you will also see the second.\r\nIf we logged the \"everything is ok\" at info level, then it is possible that they would only see the warning.\r\nI thought it was best to at least have this log message instead of completely removing the check. It may help diagnose a case in the future when someone dynamically adds gateway sender and forgets to also update their cluster

TemporaryFolder for Locator workingDirectory. Note: All of the LocatorLauncher tests are already setting workingDirectory on the launcher -- this PR updates the LocatorLauncher code to set the workingDirectory on the locator, so those tests automatically benefit from having the locator view file moved to a TemporaryFolder.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of GEODE-6825 is to better facilitate specifying where a Locator will create files, including the locator state file, so that tests can move those files to a JUnit TemporaryFolder.\r\n\r\nThis PR is divided into multiple commits to facilitate review (5. is the actual fix for GEODE-6825):\r\n\r\n1)
