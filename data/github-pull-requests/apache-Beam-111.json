there is a separated coder for Metadata which cares about `Metadata#lastModifiedMillis()`.\r\nThe issue is that the `ReadableFileCoder` always uses the default `Metadata` coder.\r\nWe need to create a similar coder for `ReadableFileCoder`: `ReadableFileCoderV2` which just use the corresponding `MetadataCoderV2`.\r\n\r\nWithout doing so `lastModifiedMillis` will remain zero.\r\n\r\nThere is also no way to create custom coder in our side since `FileIO.ReadableFile` has no public method to initiate new instance of it.\r\n\r\nAlso check this thread in [StackOverflow

sorry for the other PR for the same change. I need to revert my last PR that you reviewed because I discovered performance issues.\r\nI ran a simple group by key on a 174 million lines dataset (GDELT) and the perfs are as follow:\r\nSimpleGroupByKey on the StructuredStreaming runner before the change: 995s, no OOM\r\nSimpleGroupByKey on the RDD runner: 457s\r\nSimpleGroupByKey on the StructuredStreaming runner after the change: killed after some hours.\r\n\r\nI did also tests with Beam GroupByKeyLoadTests and I reproduced OOM because spark spill to disk saturated the filesystem (see comments in the ticket).\r\n\r\nSo I'm reverting the change because perf is very bad and the OOM does not seem to be linked to the materialization\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a mostly complete, read-only implementation of Agrona's `DirectBuffer` for use in Beam. This will be necessary to work with generated stubs.\r\n\r\nThe intent is to have a couple implementations that  more clearly indicate if it is mutable or immutable.\r\n\r\nTo clearly indicate that this is still a work-in-progress with a high chance for breaking changes, it's been marked with the `@Experimental` annotation.\r\n\r\nThis change requires a new module.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

background to this PR is that when using e.g. S3 to stage artifacts with the Spark runner, filesystems will not be registered when the worker harness tries to retrieve artifacts from the `ArtifactRetrievalService` and the following exception will be thrown:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No filesystem found for scheme s3\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't seem to affect e.g. the Flink runner, because it registers filesystems [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/v2.32.0/runners/flink/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/flink/translation/functions/FlinkExecutableStageFunction.java#L151) and in other places.\r\nI'm new to this codebase so I'm not sure if this is the best way to address this issue, but it seemed like the most straightforward. Let me know if there's a more appropriate place to put this.\r\n\r\nAlso, the call to `FileSystems.setDefaultPipelineOptions` seems like a bit of a hack that is sprinkled all across the codebase; I'm not sure what the plan is for improving this so sorry for this PR just making it worse.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

tab display breaks. The second tab will not be visible. We had [a list](https://gist.github.com/ibzib/efaeb9e737a7b96cf034cb5aa2a2b25c) of potential display bugs caused by this newline issue. Only one of the potential bugs turned out to be an actual bug, and it was on the [HCatalog IO page](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/hcatalog/). (There was also a bug on the Hadoop page, but we already fixed that.) This PR fixes the display bug on the HCatalog IO page.\r\n\r\n@aaltay \r\n@ibzib \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

allow customising the `batch_size` when streaming to BigQuery but the batch duration (used by `GroupIntoBatches`) is set to `DEFAULT_BATCH_BUFFERING_DURATION_LIMIT_SEC` (0.2)\r\n\r\nI'd like to add

are trying to achieve Protobuf schema-first development by defining protos as the single source of truth and have Beam's useBeamSchema() convert it to other formats.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to write to BigQuery using BigQueryIO.Write, we hit the issue where `google.protobuf.Timestamp` is successfully converted to `org.apache.beam.sdk.schemas.logicaltypes.NanosInstant`, but from there it cannot be converted to BigQuery's type.\r\n\r\nThe solution I came up with is to convert NanosInstant to StandardSQLTypeName.TIMESTAMP, losing 3 digits of precision, i.e. nanoseconds get truncated to microseconds.\r\n\r\nWhen reading from BigQuery into beam, the existing code converts it to Schema.FieldType.DATETIME, losing 6 digits of precision, i.e. nanoseconds get truncated to milliseconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

using state/timers on schema PCollection, we want to avoid the need to convert first into a KV object. It's unnecessary, and the fact that KV doesn't have a schema (since KvCoder can't be a SchemaCoder) makes it awkward to use in a schema world.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a new StateKeyFields annotation that can be used inside a state/timers using DoFn to specify which fields of the input schema should be used as the key. For example, the following DoFn will keep state per user and country pair.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npc.apply(new DoFn<InputT, OutputT>() {\r\n  @StateKeyFields private final StateKeySpec keySpec = StateKeySpec.fields(\"userId\", \"location.country\")\r\n  final @StateId(\"state\") StateSpec<ValueState<Integer>> stateSpec = StateSpecs.value();\r\n\r\n  @ProcessElement\r\n   public static process(@Element InputT input, @Key UserCountry userCountry) {\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `@Key` parameter annotation can be used to retrieve the current key. Any user type that has a schema matching the selected key can be used as a Key parameter (in the above example, the UserCountry type), and Beam will automatically convert the key to that type. If the key is a singleton field such as a String, you can also pass in the appropriate primitive type. You can also specify the parameter using a Row type; this all parallels the `@Element` parameter, which can also take any matching schema type.\r\n\r\nOne can also specify the key fields in the ParDo application, e.g. ParDo.of(doFn).withKeyFields(\"userId\", \"location.country\"). This is useful when programmatically generating pipelines.\r\n\r\nThe automatic type conversion code already existed in DoFnSchemaInformation, and we simply extended that code to apply to key fields as well. We add a new primitive DoFn - ParDo.MultiOutputSchemaKeyFields - that is used only when key fields are specified. This is not a new primitive from the perspective of the portable model - it is simply a different type of ParDo, and shares the same

PR introduces a throttling counter to BigQuery Storage client impl that is bumped whenever a ReadRows request retry attempt satisfies the following:\r\n1. Previous request failed with RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED status\r\n1. Previous request returned a RetryInfo object and valid delay duration.\r\nThis counter can/will be used as a throttling signal for the runtimes.\r\n\r\nRetry attempt notifications is recent feature so this PR also updates the cloud:google-cloud-bigquerystorage dependency.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR modifies the FnApiRunner to execute pipelines per-bundle instead of per-stage.\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation would work as such:\r\n1. Order the pipeline DAG topologically\r\n2. Pick the next stage in the DAG's topological sort\r\n3. Pass the input bundles to this stage\r\n4. If there are any deferred inputs from the stage, then go back to step 3.\r\n5. If there are more stages to execute, go to step 2\r\n\r\nThe new implementation works as follows:\r\n1. Create three work queues: (1)ready bundles, (2) watermark-pending bundles, and (3) real-time-pending bundles\r\n2. Add all the initial bundles (i.e. IMPULSE bundles) to the ready queue\r\n3. Fetch the next ready bundle, and the stage that consumes it\r\n4. Execute this bundle\r\n5. Enqueue all outputs from the execution of the bundle (deferred inputs, downstream outputs)\r\n6. If any of the outputs from the bundle are side inputs downstream, store them in state\r\n7. Update all of the watermarks\r\n8. If there are no ready-bundles remaining, check watermark-pending and time-pending queues to find new ready bundles\r\n9. If there are more ready bundles, go to step 3\r\n\r\nI'm happy to dive into detail for this PR.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
