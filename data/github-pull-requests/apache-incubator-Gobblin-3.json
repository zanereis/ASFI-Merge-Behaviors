Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2014\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin's Temporal workflow launches through `ExecuteGobblinJobLauncher`, but the eventSubmitter created in that class does not have the necessary metadata needed in order to send events to GaaS.\r\n\r\nWe want to populate the additional tags to read from the job props that contain the information needed for these events to be readable from GaaS.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Temporal workflows finished with JOB_COMPLETE tracker for the happy path, but GaaS does not track this event (listens to JOB_SUCCEEDED instead).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan flow e2e and validated event propagation\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to provide a way for Yarn apps to run without the need for Helix. Doing so, currently provides limited support for long running apps due to a lack of token refresh notifications.\r\n\r\nIn the future, it might make sense to implement this if long running apps are needed in Gobblin-on-temporal on yarn\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/22bdbe89-5688-4028-bab7-d0fcafa77b3e)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-07T23:01:54Z","updated_at":"2024-03-15T23:02:03Z","closed_at":"2024-03-15T23:02:02Z","merged_at":"2024-03-15T23:02:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"207756d534151e44d67d9de172b192d07bcd7d58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1e0dd357d59b45cd6929b32a31556d68cebf82bc","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-yarn-launcher-GOBBLIN-2004","ref":"mh-yarn-launcher-GOBBLIN-2004","sha":"1e0dd357d59b45cd6929b32a31556d68cebf82bc","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nI create the following new classes:\r\n\r\n`InstrumentedLeaseArbiterDecorator` - a decorator around `MultiActiveLeaseArbiter` with metrics for lease attempts (`ReminderSettingDagProcLeaseArbiter` & `ReminderSettingFlowTriggerLeaseArbiter` will extend the common functionality)\r\n\r\n`ReminderSettingDagProcArbiter ` - child class of InstrumentedLeaseArbiterDecorator used for multi-active execution to set a reminder for a dagTask an instance failed to obtain a lease on.\r\n\r\n(existing class renamed) ReminderSettingFlowTriggerLeaseArbiter will contain similar logic for Multi-active scheduling.\r\n\r\n`DagActionReminderScheduler` - provides methods for adding reminders to another `QuartzScheduler`.\r\n\r\n[needs to be done] TODO's around initializing the two classes (and creating factory methods) as well as updating the schemas of `MySqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter` & `MySqlDagActionStore` \r\n\r\nI debated the following implementation details\r\n\r\n_Re-using the same QuartzScheduler and SchedulerService from GobblinServiceJobScheduler?_\r\nBecause I want to avoid the confusion of having multiple job types in a single scheduler & in-memory QuartzSchedulers are pretty lightweight, I opted to create a separate scheduler to handle reminder events for multi-active execution lease arbitration. \r\n\r\n\r\n_Use a different lease arbitration table and instance btwn the scheduler and execution arbitration phases._\r\nI create a separate lease arbiter instance and table for execution versus scheduler so we can more easily isolate & monitor issues between scheduler and execution lease arbitration in case the cases need to be handled differently. It also allows us to use the existing code with no changes to vary the epsilon/linger values for scheduling and execution (the latter should be much greater). \r\nNote that we have to do the lease arbitration logic twice because we had separated the rollout of multi-active scheduler from executor. A future optimization would be to do de-duplication and consolidation before adding actions to the dagActionStore then arbitrate once to establish ownership of execution, but this will require significant investment to optimize working functionality so we leave this for the future.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-07T01:08:54Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T16:52:11Z","closed_at":"2024-03-19T16:44:29Z","merged_at":"2024-03-19T16:44:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"8066dc48a14d15fd3014c0d598de685478000922","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3890/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3890/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3890/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/039bf5b57dbf2338e9bbf6799e483adba7a725f0","head":{"label":"umustafi:leaseArbiterForExecution","ref":"leaseArbiterForExecution","sha":"039bf5b57dbf2338e9bbf6799e483adba7a725f0","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

jobstatus is used to check for concurrent flows\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2011\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere's a bug that causes GaaS multileader to kick off unintended concurrent flows which happens in the order described below:\r\n\r\n1. Host A checks the latest flow execution status to ensure the prior flow is not running, sees that the prior execution is still running.\r\n2. Host A fails the flow pending execution as it cannot run concurrent flow, this emits a FAILED event to GaaS which is ingested by the JobStatusMonitor.\r\n3. Host B checks the latest flow execution status, sees the current flow execution ID which is FAILED (considered a finished flow).\r\n4. Host B kicks off the pending flow execution when it shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, we need to ensure that we are looking at the past 2 flow executions, and follow the behavior:\r\n1. If there is no prior execution, kick off the pending flow\r\n2. If the prior execution is IN PROGRESS, we want to indicate that there is a concurrent flow and block the pending execution.\r\n3. If the prior execution is FINISHED, then we want to kick off the pending execution (rely on the DagManager for deduplication of flows because we do not know if the host managing this pending flow is running behind the other hosts).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-01T23:21:59Z","updated_at":"2024-03-02T00:24:15Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3888/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3888/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3888/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/74360c421730a48f9708ab244f7936d6317786c0","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:concurrent-flows-jobstatus-check","ref":"concurrent-flows-jobstatus-check","sha":"74360c421730a48f9708ab244f7936d6317786c0","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2009\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFrom my observation, setting an ACL may change the file permission if it is not the same as permission. But changing permission does not change the ACLs; it may update the mask value which changes the effective permission of the ACL entry though.\r\nThus in order to achieve same ACL and same permission in destination as source, we should first apply ACLs and then apply permissions.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -ls /tmp/x3\r\n-rw-rwxr--   3 griddata users          0 2024-02-29 20:15 /tmp/x3\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -getfacl hdfs://ltx1-holdemnn01/tmp/x3\r\n# file: hdfs://ltx1-holdemnn01/tmp/x3\r\n# owner: griddata\r\n# group: users\r\nuser::rw-\r\nuser:abora:r-x\r\ngroup::rwx\r\nmask::rwx\r\nother::r--\r\n```\r\n\r\n`hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group::r-x /tmp/x3\r\n`\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -ls /tmp/x3\r\n-rw-r-xr--   3 griddata users          0 2024-02-29 20:15 /tmp/x3\r\n```\r\n\r\n[permissions changed by changing acl]\r\n\r\n`hdfs dfs -chmod 674 /tmp/x3\r\n`\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -getfacl hdfs://ltx1-holdemnn01/tmp/x3\r\n# file: hdfs://ltx1-holdemnn01/tmp/x3\r\n# owner: griddata\r\n# group: users\r\nuser::rw-\r\nuser:abora:r-x\r\ngroup::r-x\r\nmask::rwx\r\nother::r--\r\n```\r\n\r\n[ACLs did not change, mask changes though (actually not in this example, but it does **if needed**)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING to show that setting acl and then setting permission results in the same final set of permission and acls\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ hdfs dfs -getfacl hdfs://ltx1-holdemnn01/tmp/x3\r\n# file: hdfs://ltx1-holdemnn01/tmp/x3\r\n# owner: griddata\r\n# group: users\r\nuser::rw-\r\nuser:abora:r-x\t#effective:r--\r\ngroup::rwx\t#effective:r--\r\nmask::r--\r\nother::r--\r\n\r\n$ hdfs dfs -ls /tmp/x3\r\n-rw-r--r--   3 griddata users          0 2024-02-29 20:15 /tmp/x3\r\n\r\n$ hdfs dfs -touch /tmp/x4\r\n\r\n$ hdfs dfs -ls /tmp/x4\r\n-rw-r--r--   3 griddata users          0 2024-03-01 01:31 /tmp/x4\r\n\r\n$ hdfs dfs -setfacl -m user:abora:r-x /tmp/x4\r\n\r\n$ hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group::rwx /tmp/x4\r\n\r\n$ hdfs dfs -chmod 644 /tmp/x4\r\n\r\n$ hdfs dfs -ls /tmp/x4\r\nrw-r--r--   3 griddata users          0 2024-03-01 01:31 /tmp/x4\r\n\r\n$ hdfs dfs -getfacl hdfs://ltx1-holdemnn01/tmp/x4\r\n# file: hdfs://ltx1-holdemnn01/tmp/x4\r\n# owner: griddata\r\n# group: users\r\nuser::rw-\r\nuser:abora:r-x\t#effective:r--\r\ngroup::rwx\t#effective:r--\r\nmask::r--\r\nother::r--\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nLocalFileSystem does not have ACL feature, so it cannot be tested.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2010\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nProvide the ability to execute a full Gobblin job using Temporal.io, rather than MR.  Handle an arbitrary `JobState` config that specifies the intended `Source`, `Writer`, `Publisher`, `Converter`, etc. and carry out whatever Data Movement is desired from Gobblin-on-Temporal.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nmanual execution of Iceberg-Distcp (unit tests forthcoming)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nI create the following new classes:\r\n\r\n- `GeneralLeaseArbitrationHandler` - an abstract class that is a wrapper around MySqlLeaseArbiter (`DagProcLeaseArbitrationHandler` & `FlowTriggerHandler` will extend the common functionality)\r\n- `DagProcLeaseArbitrationHandler` - child class of GeneralLeaseArbitrationHandler used for multi-active execution to set a reminder for a dagTask an instance failed to obtain a lease on. \r\n- (existing class)`FlowTriggerHandler` will contain similar logic for Multi-active scheduling. \r\n- `DagActionReminderScheduler` - provides methods for adding reminders to the `QuartzScheduler`. \r\n\r\nI debated the following implementation details \r\n\r\n1. Re-using the same `QuartzScheduler` and `SchedulerService` from `GobblinServiceJobScheduler`?\r\n_Pros_\r\n- Slightly lighter weight to have one scheduler but ultimately decided this is negligible \r\n- SchedulerService provides shutdown mechanism that waits until jobs finish to shutdown -> I’m not sure we want to wait for all reminders to fire since checkpointing will allow the hosts to pick back up upon startup \r\n\r\n_Cons_\r\n- Have to ensure job keys and trigger keys are unique and potential for overlap \r\n- Over-engineered solution for the simple reminder functionality desired here \r\n\r\nBecause we don't want to wait until all reminders fire to shutdown the scheduler & it's much quicker to not re-use the same scheduler, I created a new `QuartzScheduler`. It should be relatively lightweight and changeable in the future. \r\n \r\n\r\n2. Use a different lease arbitration table btwn the scheduler and execution arbitration phases. \r\n_Pros_\r\n- do not need two different `LAUNCH` FlowAction types, one for scheduling and one for execution (although simple to implement) \r\n- can use different `linger/epsilon` values which will be crucial for the two different pieces\r\n\r\nI opted to go for the separate lease arbiter table approach because it makes having different constants for `linger/epsilon` easier to implement rather than make the sql logic complicated. Note that there's no further granularity over tuning these values for each action if the expected time to complete them are different but they should not vary much and we can choose large enough linger values that encompass all requirements. \r\n\r\n_NOTE: I have not yet worked on the event timestamp for the dagActions_\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    4. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    5. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    6. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    7. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-28T22:15:08Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T22:12:24Z","closed_at":"2024-03-06T22:12:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e21af32edd62a0ab962787c5d3c9a91a440ef13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/bfc6f158299a7e365e23f5592e52fd1600c6a64e","head":{"label":"umustafi:generalizeLeaseArbiterAfterPatch","ref":"generalizeLeaseArbiterAfterPatch","sha":"bfc6f158299a7e365e23f5592e52fd1600c6a64e","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2007\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAdds the `GenerateWorkUnits` Activity to generate `WorkUnit`s, bin pack them, and write in serialized form to the FileSystem.   The activity creates the specified `Source` and `.getWorkUnits()` on it, as directed by `JobState` config.\r\n\r\nHereafter it is no longer necessary to use another platform, such as the `MRJobLauncher` to generate the WUs that Temporal would execute.\r\n\r\nIncluded is a demonstration-only `GenerateWorkUnitsWorkflow` that exercises solely the new activity and then exits.  A full end-to-end Temporal workflow is forthcoming in a future PR.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nso-far: successful manual execution on `CopySource` with `IcebergDatasetFinder`\r\nfuture: automated unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2001\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently in the Gobblin framework all failed tasks will emit events when they fail and include some stacktrace to provide context on the failure. This is problematic when there are Gobblin jobs with hundreds of thousands of tasks (e.g. iceberg distcp) and causes Kafka partitions to lag under the larger events. \r\n\r\nWe want to enable a config to disable this, and potentially extend this solution to disable all task level events as they can get quite noisy and logs generally provide better context.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables emitting failed events if `gobblin.task.disable.failed.event.emission` is set to true (defaults to false so no change)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-10T00:17:55Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T00:17:11Z","closed_at":"2024-02-12T19:14:08Z","merged_at":"2024-02-12T19:14:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"75d9336f0fe4f8e564c32c6440a343ac66bba183","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3877/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3877/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3877/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3eb2ce2ef809d92e9296e1bc8ab47395056cc919","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:disable-task-failed-event-if-configured","ref":"disable-task-failed-event-if-configured","sha":"3eb2ce2ef809d92e9296e1bc8ab47395056cc919","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Since the `TableMetadata` from WU planning will always have already been serialized and deserialized, this invariably leads to:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.iceberg.exceptions.CommitFailedException: Cannot commit: stale table metadata\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur fix is to essentially implement our own (ID-only) value comparison within `IcebergRegisterStep`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

running flow execution ID to handle race condition of concurrent hosts misreporting status\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1999\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nIn GaaS multileader there is a race condition where one host will compile/kick off a job, and the other hosts have an expected behavior of compiling the job but avoiding submission until the DagManager supports multiple leaders. \r\n\r\nThe other non-leader hosts will try to check if the current job is running, and then mark the flow as failed due to seeing that the leader has already compiled the job. This leads to scenarios where flows with all successful jobs can be marked as  a failed flow before the underlying jobs even report their status, due to the other hosts failing due to the concurrency check.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves this issue by making an additional check that if the flow waiting to be submitted is the same flow execution ID as the currently running flow (in progress of submission/already running), we move forward and rely on the DagManager to perform deduplication of multiple submissions.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1997\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIf a non-active host receives and processes the `LAUNCH` event before the leader does, then we encounter a `SpecNotFoundException` [here](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/67c610117c2b757bb15714826e0b0edc3e6b26a5/gobblin-service/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/service/monitoring/DagActionStoreChangeMonitor.java#L290 ) when the leader goes to process the event and the execution of the `LAUNCH` will be missed. This PR moves the deletion to the `DagManager` and does it only after completing `addDag` to persist the event and after checking active status. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-30T18:27:23Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T00:26:17Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T00:26:17Z","merged_at":"2024-01-31T00:26:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e07cc7de550dddc52dc108e809f181149ad6f72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3872/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3872/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3872/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d09f40836066126eb2e079c9b091774aa9b446d5","head":{"label":"umustafi:avoidDeletingFlowSpecEarly","ref":"avoidDeletingFlowSpecEarly","sha":"d09f40836066126eb2e079c9b091774aa9b446d5","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1994\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nIceberg-distcp replication currently risks introducing inconsistency to the destination/replication-target table, because the current snapshot version of the tables may change between the planning phase (of creating WorkUnits) and the final post-copy commit to the destination table.\r\n\r\nTo inoculate against any concurrent commits, ensure correctness by committing:\r\n\r\n1. the same source-side metadata observed while first listing the source table during the Planning Phase and\r\n2. the same dest-side metadata observed just prior to that first listing of the source table.\r\n\r\nThis guarantees that:\r\n\r\n1. any later-modified source table metadata would not be committed to dest (at least not until a subsequent execution)\r\n2. any interim commit to the dest table would result in the distcp replication commit failing (which may then be resolved by launching a new iceberg distcp execution on the same table)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nupdated unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    4. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    5. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    6. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    7. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    8. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-29T22:34:58Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T21:47:15Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T21:47:15Z","merged_at":"2024-01-31T21:47:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"f6f1bc51d3fc020add7e7a1ee6760432f197870d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3870/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3870/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3870/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ff5636e1a7ce25e782189eb68d16a6082cc012d6","head":{"label":"phet:iceberg-distcp-consistent-metadata","ref":"iceberg-distcp-consistent-metadata","sha":"ff5636e1a7ce25e782189eb68d16a6082cc012d6","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1993\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nNot all iceberg replication schemes require copying 'metadata.json' files, perhaps because the dest-side catalog will generate its own, rather than reusing those from source.  moving these files nonetheless add the requirement to manage their lifetime on the replication side, which did not actually create them.  Provide config to skip the copy altogether... and default it to skip.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nupdated existing tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-26T23:38:52Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T21:27:03Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T21:27:03Z","merged_at":"2024-01-29T21:27:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"3061c7048840fab0eccff2a42ef303b500e0f20c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/81e10d711c11719eabe2af18af22e59dd552394e","head":{"label":"phet:iceberg-distcp-not-metadata.json","ref":"iceberg-distcp-not-metadata.json","sha":"81e10d711c11719eabe2af18af22e59dd552394e","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1992\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently the Temporal job context does not include the job metadata e.g. flow name, flow group, flow execution ID, which is critical for debugging workflows in the temporal cluster.\r\n\r\nWe want to have per job logging so that it is easier to debug multiple Gobblin workflows on Temporal sent through GaaS.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExample logs can have this format (given the correct log4j property)\r\n```\r\n2024-01-25 20:23:10 PST INFO  [flow.group:<flowGroup> flow.name:<flowName> flow.executionId:<flowExecutionId>] [workflow-method-ProcessWorkUnits_1705956735874_kfketl2_99163923-382b91cd-8608-4808-86db-8b341a9c93ef] <ClassName> - Message\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-26T04:11:39Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T17:10:06Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T21:44:28Z","merged_at":"2024-01-29T21:44:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"67c610117c2b757bb15714826e0b0edc3e6b26a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4db96f52e98f64b3da2d9a6d1d30a33e46d3fc2b","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:setup-logs-temporal-mdc","ref":"setup-logs-temporal-mdc","sha":"4db96f52e98f64b3da2d9a6d1d30a33e46d3fc2b","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1991\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nRecursiveCopyableDataset.getDatasetPath() is returning the source dataset's path. But the use of this method is to calculate the shard path by destination dataset handlers. This method should return the target dataset's path.\r\nThis bug will fail the jobs where source path and target paths are different and source path cannot be created on target filesystem.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded a unit test, which fails without the code change in this PR\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-25T03:00:34Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T23:03:09Z","closed_at":"2024-01-25T23:03:09Z","merged_at":"2024-01-25T23:03:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"389c15851248fecfb13b737ea1ddde31800896d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/254e3c50fff046512df0fd42db3cf8097d7fabc4","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:rootPathFileDistcp","ref":"rootPathFileDistcp","sha":"254e3c50fff046512df0fd42db3cf8097d7fabc4","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1988\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nNow when the OOM error happens, we just log out the error and keep the container running there without doing anything. In this case we should fail the container and retry the task.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nMock the OOM error and verified that before the change, task just hang there, and after the change, task got failed and retried as expected\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1986\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nNaively logging every input holds the potential to go WAY overboard.  w/ 50k+ work units, I found it to actually cripple the UI of my executor.  for reference, I downloaded the executor logs:\r\n```\r\n$ egrep 'input files at' ~/executor-logs_88066352.log | wc\r\n       1  578167 49237326\r\n\r\n$ cat ~/executor-logs_88066352.log | wc\r\n   42240  988632 56428831\r\n```\r\nsee: just that one line has 49M of the 56M chars of my (otherwise voluminous!) output. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nexisting unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-17T18:15:21Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T19:11:40Z","closed_at":"2024-01-17T19:11:40Z","merged_at":"2024-01-17T19:11:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"f95b36fb88193546709229d1baa6962230fa88bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/46d5a4cf4d7b31f0dc4283fb3e444c437c7f5f48","head":{"label":"phet:avoid-logging-every-input-file-status","ref":"avoid-logging-every-input-file-status","sha":"46d5a4cf4d7b31f0dc4283fb3e444c437c7f5f48","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1985\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n`SourceHadoopFsEndPoint.getWatermark` currently misses certain changes to the contents of the dirs it covers because it doesn't use the mod time of those enclosing dirs when calculating the watermark.  despite those dirs not being among the files to copy, they must still participate in the watermark calculation because some compute engines, like spark, first write files to a temp subdir beneath the ultimate dest dir.  (since those temp subdirs are not valid paths, they'll anyway be skipped.)  once all executors have written their file, spark moves each from that temp subdir up to the enclosing ultimate dir location.  such file movement DOES NOT update the mod time of the file itself, only that of its enclosing dir--hence the need to incorporate the enclosing dir's mod time, in order to observe such dir changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-12T04:00:45Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T22:00:36Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T22:00:36Z","merged_at":"2024-01-12T22:00:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"be600217aff57d851cd82b72bc59b2639a3465fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/892037b4501145f431c21bdefc165768fc2a74b3","head":{"label":"phet:include-enclosing-dir-in-watermark","ref":"include-enclosing-dir-in-watermark","sha":"892037b4501145f431c21bdefc165768fc2a74b3","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\nRight now, DagManager is a one big class that does all the work , e.g. \r\n1) accepting flow requests (new/update/kill/resume)\r\n2) polling existing dags for completion\r\n3) managing dags in memory\r\n\r\nWe want to break down it's functionality into small components that are also easier to test.\r\nWe also want to eventually replace in memory dags to mysql.\r\n\r\nThis PR will attempt to move some of the tasks DagManager do to other new components like DagManagementTaskStreamImpl and DagProcEngineThread.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11tV-jWk7DKAV87PyeHN2o-Q8RejZeJ551xSgHes_-K0/edit?usp=sharing \r\n\r\nWe create DagProcEngineEnabledDagActionStoreChangeMonitor to avoid checking `dagProcEngineEnabled` everytime. This implementation will be chosen via Guice in the next PR.\r\n\r\nDagManagementStateStore will contain all the in-mem dag data, mysql dag state store, mysql failed dag state store and mysql flow catalog and thus will provide a one place for all the dag related information.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1910\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadd a unit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-12T00:36:53Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T05:26:57Z","closed_at":"2024-03-09T16:45:45Z","merged_at":"2024-03-09T16:45:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"02eca4f8de577930b4ba88f138b3631102308524","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3858/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3858/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3858/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/dfe89a712d9785c170a8889970e1fb760a2bd507","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:prDagRefactor-Stage-2","ref":"prDagRefactor-Stage-2","sha":"dfe89a712d9785c170a8889970e1fb760a2bd507","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1984\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn a previous change, we noticed the compiled `flowExecutionId` was different from the one during execution and tried to fix it by updating the `flowMetadata` used to send GTE relating to compilation. See problematic patch https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3823 \r\nWe succeeded in updating the compilation event to use the `flowExecutionId` but did not update the `FlowSpec` used by `Compiler` to create the `Dag` which is used during the execution phase of flow management. The `compiler` retrieves a `flowExecutionId` if one exists in the `flowSpec` (which it does for adhoc flows), otherwise generates a new one ([code](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/compare/master...umustafi:gobblin:updateFlowSpecWithId?expand=1#301]).) We do need to modify the `FlowSpec` then with the consensus `flowExecutionId` before forwarding it to the `DagManager`.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note_ I considered adding a `flowExecutionId` field to the `FlowSpec` function but we have integrated the idea of retrieving flowExecutionId from config so deeply that it would be hard to change all the places that access the id through config. Additionally, I've decided against creating a new `FlowSpec` (instead updating the existing one) since we only use the `FlowSpec` for compilation and in creating a new `FlowSpec` its important to make sure it's constructed correctly to avoid ser/deser issues. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdates validation helper tests and adds FlowSpec updateProperty test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-12T00:07:44Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T18:05:43Z","closed_at":"2024-01-16T18:05:43Z","merged_at":"2024-01-16T18:05:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"913d580fe19e7a6adc60d3294bac44e5a32d7bba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3857/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3857/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3857/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ea8b1e0372c062ae6ef62ef93fe166d6ca8e1e44","head":{"label":"umustafi:updateFlowSpecWithId","ref":"updateFlowSpecWithId","sha":"ea8b1e0372c062ae6ef62ef93fe166d6ca8e1e44","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1982\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe problem statement addressed in this issue is to determine a unique ID per execution that is agreed upon by all hosts, computed before returning any information back to user (about compilation or execution).\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the request for an `adhoc flow`, the recipient host creates a `flowExecutionId` when initializing `FlowSpec` from `config` for non-scheduled flows (see [code](https://jarvis.corp.linkedin.com/codesearch/result/?name=FlowConfigResourceLocalHandler.java&path=gobblin-elr%2Fgobblin-restli%2Fgobblin-flow-config-service%2Fgobblin-flow-config-service-server%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fgobblin%2Fservice&reponame=linkedin%2Fgobblin-elr#276)). This `flowExecutionId` is returned to the user for tracking the flow status. This should not change later on.\r\n\r\nScheduled flows are fired upon each host at a different system clock time, so those ones need a consensus mechanism to coordinate between hosts. During `multiActiveLeaseArbitration` we update the `flowExecutionId` of a `DagAction` with an agreed upon value from the database to gain this consistency. However, this should only be done for scheduled flows before we any information externally about the `flowExecutionId` until later.\r\n\r\nTo address the problems above we \r\n1) skip `flowExecutionId` replacement for adhoc flows\r\n2) remove a flow compilation and `GTE` emission before the consensus on `flowExecutionId` is removed.\r\nThere's no significant impact of removing this check. It will result in `dagActions` created for flows that may fail compilation later (after lease arbitration and before execution). Since we already compile the flow on accepting it, we are okay with a slight delay in failing a flow.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe flowExecutionId replacement is tested by existing unit test `testAcquireLeaseSingleParticipant` and the new functionality is tested by `testSkipFlowExecutionIdReplacement`. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

\"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-10T00:43:06Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T19:17:00Z","closed_at":"2024-01-10T19:17:00Z","merged_at":"2024-01-10T19:17:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"22248e4f2b01859c7e833b99f6770a2d4bd15d6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ce36bc5ab7bef1a3b53459d269a43eaf2a9bd5dd","head":{"label":"umustafi:consistentFlowIdForCompilation","ref":"consistentFlowIdForCompilation","sha":"ce36bc5ab7bef1a3b53459d269a43eaf2a9bd5dd","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1981\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThere are some properties in Gobblin that are not typesafe when put in a Config class object, this causes issues with GaaS passing those properties to Gobblin cluster.\r\nTo resolve this, we should fix the property names so that there are no conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe property in particular we want to change is `writer.file.path.type` that conflicts with `writer.file.path` due to sharing the same prefix but expanding the key when there's a value mapped to it (making it not type safe as it can't transform a string value to a map). We can rename this property to writer.file.pathType.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nBackwards compatible\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-03T19:17:25Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T21:05:44Z","closed_at":"2024-01-03T21:05:43Z","merged_at":"2024-01-03T21:05:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"39ffa2f2d166a8d4bc7768a40ba21b67325ab08a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1ed9fad3758d072fc4e46f4f1beb61c0e5862145","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:rename-writer-path-type-config","ref":"rename-writer-path-type-config","sha":"1ed9fad3758d072fc4e46f4f1beb61c0e5862145","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1978\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe encounter a `NullPointerException` when initializing the `DagActionStoreMonitor` after moving the loading of `DagActions` on startup from the `DagManager` to the `DagActionStoreMonitor`. Metrics for the `DagActionStoreMonitor` were initialized by its parent class the `HighLevelConsumer` only before starting to consume Kafka messages, however with the refactor these metrics are needed beforehand. In this PR I separate the creation of these metrics into a separate function and call it before loading dagActions. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-21T20:40:00Z","updated_at":"2023-12-22T19:03:28Z","closed_at":"2023-12-22T19:03:28Z","merged_at":"2023-12-22T19:03:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"e392c97debfbcd3cd8e687517f5eb1bf904286d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3851/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3851/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3851/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e45bd5625621cdad861089f2f7dca4084bf08c69","head":{"label":"umustafi:initializeDagActionStoreMonitorMetrics","ref":"initializeDagActionStoreMonitorMetrics","sha":"e45bd5625621cdad861089f2f7dca4084bf08c69","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1979\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nLogging Task state collector failure at the granularity of every task is impractical, when tasks number in the 100k's.  Moreover the stacktrace from retrieval failure provides no meaningful info--even more so when faced w/ thousands of repetitive logs like (pre-change):\r\n```\r\n2023/12/20 22:08:17.894 +0000 WARN [ParallelRunner] [Azkaban] Task failed: Deserialize state for task_name_of_job_task_goes_here_0_1703105111101_51.tst\r\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 0, Size: 0\r\n\tat java.util.ArrayList.rangeCheck(ArrayList.java:657)\r\n\tat java.util.ArrayList.get(ArrayList.java:433)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.runtime.TaskStateCollectorService$2.call(TaskStateCollectorService.java:216)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.runtime.TaskStateCollectorService$2.call(TaskStateCollectorService.java:213)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.util.executors.MDCPropagatingCallable.call(MDCPropagatingCallable.java:42)\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.TrustedListenableFutureTask$TrustedFutureInterruptibleTask.runInterruptibly(TrustedListenableFutureTask.java:111)\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.InterruptibleTask.run(InterruptibleTask.java:58)\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.TrustedListenableFutureTask.run(TrustedListenableFutureTask.java:75)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\nTherefore only log sparsely (but present a running total) and omit the stack trace.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThis arose because the dest-side volume enforced the namespace quota, which left over 100k+ WUs failing.  so while not every day, this is a normal occurrence and therefore deserves graceful handling.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nexisting unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-21T01:08:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-24T04:11:04Z","closed_at":"2023-12-24T04:11:04Z","merged_at":"2023-12-24T04:11:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"3302569feb3de8444cca68456dd649cc41f7bf60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ea0cd42498577fde120aca74a610e5d528a446e3","head":{"label":"phet:constrain-task-state-collector-failure-logging","ref":"constrain-task-state-collector-failure-logging","sha":"ea0cd42498577fde120aca74a610e5d528a446e3","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1977\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe `PasswordManager` silently continues on when the configured master password key path does not exist in the FS.  this makes debugging exceptionally difficult.  Instead, it should log such a warning, upon finding that situation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nexisting tests, as this change concerns logging only\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-15T18:07:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T19:28:39Z","closed_at":"2023-12-15T19:28:39Z","merged_at":"2023-12-15T19:28:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb36e2c8a3b24b11aabc43682969f0d44d392e7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2cf84dfc3730922d048358274ed6105965d082d2","head":{"label":"phet:password-manager-logging-when-enc-key-not-exists","ref":"password-manager-logging-when-enc-key-not-exists","sha":"2cf84dfc3730922d048358274ed6105965d082d2","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

It is difficult to consolidate watermarks between different tables so instead use a config feature flag to maintain the jobname instead of using a GaaS generated name.\r\n\r\nThis also prevents the need of overshortening jobnames if they are generated too long as users can now just specify a shorter name instead of having GaaS potentially change current watermarks.\r\n\r\nReverts https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3822 as this is a much less disruptive change\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1973\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen Manifest distcp fails to set permissions for any reason, we would expect a retry of the copy to allow the datasets to reach eventual consistency. However, the current logic of checking if a file is eligible for copy is to check if the source file is newer, if so copy, and if the source file is exactly the same modification time as the destination file, also copy if the permissions are different. However, in most cases the destination will have a newer modification time once it is written and set permissions, so the source file will generally be older but we still want the permissions to match.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the check so that if the source file is older, we still want to check permissions between source and destination to ensure if the file is eligible for copy.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1972\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nA regression in Iceberg-Distcp began erroneously showing the job finishing as \"SUCCESSFUL\", despite the commit step failing with an exception.  The same Iceberg-Distcp `CommitStep` fails (`org.apache.gobblin.data.management.copy.iceberg.IcebergRegisterStep`), but with apache gobblin build `0.18.0-dev-493` it correctly shows \"FAILED\" yet with `0.18.0-dev-515` it claims \"SUCCEEDED\".  (see the ticket for more details)\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be due to changes made here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3804/files#diff-65bb0891b2d30ff3515db8eae2c7986872fd410c898241ee2bb962a28721d0c7\r\n\r\nspecifically the reordering of:\r\n```\r\nexecuteCommitSequence(postPublish);\r\n```\r\nAs mentioned in code comments, this MUST NOT run before the WU is actually executed:\r\n```\r\n      // ensure every successful state is committed\r\n      if (wus.getWorkingState() == WorkingState.SUCCESSFUL) {\r\n        wus.setWorkingState(WorkUnitState.WorkingState.COMMITTED);\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nthat's because `WorkUnitState::getWorkingState()` returns `WorkingState.SUCCESSFUL` merely when the overall job succeeded--even for WUs yet to execute!\r\n\r\nthus it must wait to run for post-publish steps until after:\r\n```\r\nexecuteCommitSequence(postPublishSteps);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nmanual testing\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-06T20:43:13Z","updated_at":"2023-12-07T19:40:27Z","closed_at":"2023-12-07T19:40:27Z","merged_at":"2023-12-07T19:40:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"00c60ca6492644652c66905eb384ab145e348bbf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/25672ffb29811c62a26ad77cb7e1b9f9c0c768a4","head":{"label":"phet:fix-copy-data-publisher-post-publish-commit","ref":"fix-copy-data-publisher-post-publish-commit","sha":"25672ffb29811c62a26ad77cb7e1b9f9c0c768a4","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1989] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1989\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAs part of Gobblin's implementation of an alternative for MapReduce with Temporal as the primary orchestrator, Gobblin needs to support replayable event submission (i.e. Exactly once semantics for submission of `GobblinTrackingEvent` even after replays).\r\n\r\nTo make incremental progress before k8s integration, I am choosing to leverage YARN. The current implementation interacts with 3 key pieces:\r\n1. Azkaban\r\n2. GaaS\r\n3. Yarn cluster (Borrowed from fast ingest gobblin cluster code)\r\n\r\n![Untitled-2024-01-22-1711](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/a873d5d9-f9dd-4825-9cb6-68783efd986f)\r\n\r\n1. Carbon CLI triggers GaaS to produce workunits. This is currently done by toggling a flag that cancels the MR job after workunit creation\r\n2. GaaS sends MR job config to Azkaban\r\n3. Azkaban creates execution\r\n4. Execution persists the workunits to HDFS, returning the path\r\n5. The path is passed to a different Azkaban execution, which invokes the Yarn App Launcher. \r\n6. Yarn app launcher follows the fast ingest code and spins up a yarn application, which provides allocates containers for the Distcp job. \r\n7. Gobblin cluster uses the information from HDFS workunit to create tasks in Temporal\r\n  a. Workunit is fetched from HDFS. Job State is also fetched add metadata tags in tracking events\r\n  b. Temporal is used to propogate the workunits from AM to task runners / workers\r\n8. GTE is emitted to Kafka via the code in this PR to signal start and completion\r\n9. GaaS, listening via the avro job status monitor, updates the job state table\r\n\r\nSome future work that is needed is more metadata for GaaS to create the new job entry. The current job status is not fetchible via GaaS rest API but the job status is updated in the metadata mysql table \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    11. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    12. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    13. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    14. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    15. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-05T22:18:54Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T19:03:26Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T19:03:26Z","merged_at":"2024-01-31T19:03:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"96e7b162074df9b01207aa5fd0c864af72974c0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/615193a6e953b801d7fbd1afe29749390660f75e","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-temporal-timer","ref":"mh-temporal-timer","sha":"615193a6e953b801d7fbd1afe29749390660f75e","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1971\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nFor some dataset lineage schemes, metadata tracing must take into account not only the Iceberg `TableIdentifier`, but also the catalog where that table resides.  Allow therefore `IcebergCatalog`s to adjust the name of the tables they create, for metadata reporting purposes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUpdated existing test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-04T20:35:20Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T22:01:20Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T22:01:20Z","merged_at":"2023-12-04T22:01:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc456b96166db375f2ec4a2066f67f96a023d861","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3842/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3842/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3842/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8d9687299f05668da647ab430e5be093f2cdf201","head":{"label":"phet:iceberg_catalog_may_qualify_table_name","ref":"iceberg_catalog_may_qualify_table_name","sha":"8d9687299f05668da647ab430e5be093f2cdf201","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1970\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe have similar code in the `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor` and `DagManager` to process dag actions from the `DagActionStore`. There have been small discrepancies between the code in each area leading to unexpected bugs in how the actions are processed, so to fix forward and make this easier to maintain with code in one place we consolidate all logic relating to the dag action processing to the `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor`. The processing in the change monitor is working correctly, while the handling of launch events in the `DagManager` is failing compilation most likely due to an error loading the job templates when initializing the compiler but we're not able to identify the exact issue. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-04T19:32:02Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T19:10:38Z","closed_at":"2023-12-06T18:20:18Z","merged_at":"2023-12-06T18:20:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4ba9d366ea000ab8d42c223890fafc842e7495f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3841/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3841/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3841/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2afd806dec585500369346c98e6f96c21120d3b5","head":{"label":"umustafi:refactorDagManagerStartup","ref":"refactorDagManagerStartup","sha":"2afd806dec585500369346c98e6f96c21120d3b5","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1967\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGaaS has datanodes for HTTP, SFTP, and HDFS/Table varients. However, in some scenarios we want a generic identifier for an external ingress/egress flow running in GaaS. Reason being is that there are some usecases that can be very generic and we want to avoid adapting these flows to the opinionated setup of GaaS, while maintaining compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1966\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFixes bug where launch action events are not deleted after passing them off to the `DagManager` from the `DagActionStoreMonitor`. This results in an accumulation of all launch events that are retried upon startup and then deleted. This makes restart/deploy extremely toil heavy and does unnecessary work. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-28T18:16:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T20:05:10Z","closed_at":"2023-11-29T20:05:09Z","merged_at":"2023-11-29T20:05:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2924600b341e3fbe4e0c16ba07a7beed8345dae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3837/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3837/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3837/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/52c8378da7eeac32516a83970ab83e17a179b671","head":{"label":"umustafi:launchDagActionBugFixes","ref":"launchDagActionBugFixes","sha":"52c8378da7eeac32516a83970ab83e17a179b671","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1961\r\n  \r\n\"Qualify IcebergTable DatasetDescriptors (used by Iceberg-Distcp)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe same DB name and table name are currently used in common for both the source-side table and the dest-side table.  Instead, these should be allowed to be different, so facilitate separately specifying source names and dest names.  Nonetheless, continue, for the sake of backwards compatibility, to support the legacy properties that specify the current combo props (shared by both source AND destination).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nenhanced existing tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-21T23:28:22Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T20:41:31Z","closed_at":"2023-11-22T19:20:36Z","merged_at":"2023-11-22T19:20:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"97e845915b9374d82791b3782e4279531df429f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0129e9a549f6bf332957170b400674a488961a4a","head":{"label":"phet:iceberg_dataset_use_separate_per-catalog_table_IDs","ref":"iceberg_dataset_use_separate_per-catalog_table_IDs","sha":"0129e9a549f6bf332957170b400674a488961a4a","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1959\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently, the partial success semantics in Gobblin where it follows a commit on task success policy will return a successful job running status even though some tasks fail. This is because in most Gobblin jobs, there would be movement of the watermark after the tasks succeed so we want to follow that semantic to not lead to duplicate ingestion.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some Gobblin jobs (distcp) which do not follow the watermark semantic, thus a partial success should return a failed status so that the job callers can understand that not every task has succeeded, thus invoke a retry with amended amounts of work.\r\n\r\nIntroduce configuration `job.commit.partial.fail.task.fails.job.commit` and if enabled along with `job.commit.policy=successful` and `publish.data.at.job.level=false`, will commit task successes but fail the overall job\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1958\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe current /flowexecutions implementation treats the presence of a pending action differently between RESUME and KILL: for the former it gives HTTP 409 Conflict and the latter gives HTTP 400 Bad Request.\r\n\r\n1. fix so it is 409 in both cases\r\n2. in all error handling, forward any message to include in the `RestLiServiceException` (it had been dropped when 400)\r\n3. combine the impls between RESUME and KILL to ensure consistency\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nexisting unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1968\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTemporal is the next-gen distributed computing platform Gobblin is using to replace MapReduce for many of its data movement workflows. We want to integrate Gobblin's commit step that tracks task states and reports their status with Temporal.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a temporal workflow and activity for committing task states\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-15T23:03:27Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T23:57:28Z","closed_at":"2023-12-15T23:57:27Z","merged_at":"2023-12-15T23:57:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"18fba9e5c3d70f21a7b1dbe2b65ee83c23bfa4e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3829/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3829/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3829/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a45ce09fe612ad895244e4f56d0b00b0da5ccb1e","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:temporal-commit-step-integration","ref":"temporal-commit-step-integration","sha":"a45ce09fe612ad895244e4f56d0b00b0da5ccb1e","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1957\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nGobblinORCWriter self tune uses a number of metrics to determine how large their buffers should be for both its own internal buffer used for conversion and the native ORC writer buffer. However when there are very large record sizes (100s of kb) the buffers default max size (e.g. 1000) can still hold a very large amount of data. Observed performance would be hundreds of megabytes to even a gigabyte depending on the configured batch size maximums.\r\n\r\nWe want a configuration to impose a maximum buffer max size so that large records in the buffer do not exceed the size of a stripe, so when it is added to the native ORC Writer, the native orc writer should be flushing its records and freeing the memory.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the configuration `orcWriter.auto.selfTune.max.buffer.orc.stripe` which when enabled to `true`, will restrict the max buffer size to be the value of the ORC stripe size divided by the estimated record size recorded. Since it can still tune the buffer sizes in between the min value (1) and this maximum, it will not overfill the buffers like previously recorded. \r\n\r\nSince this configuration may impact performance, hid it under a feature flag as it will lead to less OOM but more frequent memory checks may impact write speed. However since it should generally be checking as often as it has enough memory to fill one stripe, this should be acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUnit tests, tested on large topic, reduction in OOM observed\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-15T21:05:57Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T20:49:54Z","closed_at":"2023-11-21T16:17:57Z","merged_at":"2023-11-21T16:17:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b890759ac1758b5d18777d61a2e5df528f614ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3828/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3828/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3828/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7c4bc0ae21e4a0b97b14a18ad45c0ee930ecb1b5","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:orcwriter-improvements-large-records","ref":"orcwriter-improvements-large-records","sha":"7c4bc0ae21e4a0b97b14a18ad45c0ee930ecb1b5","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1956\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nKafka max.poll.records affect the performance of the Kafka consumer.\r\nConfig it to be a lower number means it take more time to process each record. While config it to be a higher number means we need more memory to hold the records. So we should use the avg record size to determine the value for different topics. \r\n\r\nWe use the max avg record size among all assigned partition to avoid OOM issue as much as possible. \r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test and test by running the pipeline\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-15T00:51:12Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T23:19:16Z","closed_at":"2023-11-16T23:19:16Z","merged_at":"2023-11-16T23:19:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"af5299d5b3e01e2587dbecf315a18973bba1eb42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3827/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3827/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3827/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/807027fb4e58ec205ee56f46587922e72237b06c","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1956","ref":"GOBBLIN-1956","sha":"807027fb4e58ec205ee56f46587922e72237b06c","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe current metrics are not descriptive in what sorts of exceptions are occurring. The current try catch block is catching all exceptions, which could include errors other than malformed ORC file exceptions. \r\n\r\nI am adding this feature as a stop-gap for better insight while I am in parallel working on a change for removing orphan files on startup at the publisher level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-14T00:11:52Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T21:13:46Z","closed_at":"2023-11-14T21:13:45Z","merged_at":"2023-11-14T21:13:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"315d9599e08521dd71ae6dccb09b7f7254961564","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/951ccd05d1e9213cdb2f388785e94710af90b64d","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-cleanup-on-start-basedatapublisher-GOBBLIN-1953","ref":"mh-cleanup-on-start-basedatapublisher-GOBBLIN-1953","sha":"951ccd05d1e9213cdb2f388785e94710af90b64d","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1955\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nEmit metric to count the number of lease owners that fail to persist their lease. If there are a large number of them then we may want to increase our default linger values to be larger as the lease may be expiring before an owner persists their lease. \r\nThis PR also reduces the number of info logs as they're no longer as necessary. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-09T23:42:33Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T19:11:40Z","closed_at":"2023-11-15T19:11:39Z","merged_at":"2023-11-15T19:11:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd17bed4367addd9c68608e2795ffae2d08434b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/43dcca026a8b2cb8ff93bebcdc0111a46deb0742","head":{"label":"umustafi:leaseArbiterLingerMetric","ref":"leaseArbiterLingerMetric","sha":"43dcca026a8b2cb8ff93bebcdc0111a46deb0742","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

  * makes Config object with FlowSpec mutable\r\n   * adds unit test to ensure flow compiles after updating FlowSpec\r\n   * ensure DagManager resilient to exceptions on leadership change\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1954\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n**Original changes:**\r\nWhen copying a `flowSpec` to add `flowExecutionId` into its config, all components need to be carefully duplicated to ensure compilation, serialization and deserialization are successful. Some pieces can easily be missed so instead, we add the property to the `Properties` object of the `FlowSpec` which is mutable. Note that we do not update the `Config` object to avoid large GC overhead from deleting and creating a new `Config` object. This test also ensures that the `DagManager` thread will not silently die during leadership changes by catching all types of `Exceptions`.  \r\n**Updated design**\r\nThe updated design is to not attempt to copy or update the `FlowSpec` which is meant to be consistent across flow executions. We don't need the `flowExecutionId` added there since it's only used to read it and update the flowMetadata (map of few flow spec properties). We only need it in the `flowMetadata` obj which contains `flowExecutionId` for the purpose of emitting event info.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- Adds unit tests to FlowCompilationValidationHelper helper function `addFlowExecutionIdIfAbsent` adds a flowExecutionId in the right circumstances\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-09T01:28:47Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T01:47:36Z","closed_at":"2023-11-15T01:47:36Z","merged_at":"2023-11-15T01:47:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"668749806f2c2f0066d926a3cc72cd0e3cb17900","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3823/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3823/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3823/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/36162db3a4582065f577d588851c2677602cdc67","head":{"label":"umustafi:unitTestFlowSpecUpdate","ref":"unitTestFlowSpecUpdate","sha":"36162db3a4582065f577d588851c2677602cdc67","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1952\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin-as-a-Service creates jobnames using flowgroups flownames, edges, and jobnames from the template. However, this tends to create a very long string which then causes issues in Gobblin job when creating files that use the jobname to create working directories or state stores. \r\n\r\nAlthough there has been previous code that shortens job name lengths, we want to further increase this by being more aggressive with the maximum length of the jobname to reduce the odds of exceeding 255 chars (max length of HDFS component)\r\n\r\nThe PR reduces the max job name length to 128 characters (1/2 of previous max) as well as forcing jobnames to then be shortened to `flowGroup_<job_hash>` which will be a UUID at a per-job level for each dag.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it uses flowGroup still as a prefix before the jobname hash is to reduce the odds that a shared job working directory will run into hash collisions, which can lead to complications on concurrent jobs\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-07T02:45:01Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T18:06:25Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T18:06:24Z","merged_at":"2023-11-08T18:06:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"5619a0a421143819360262e0b8ec29cfef9a4ba7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/38b9be7163a17062a16fe5765fdec077c6ab520a","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-bug-long-jobnames","ref":"fix-bug-long-jobnames","sha":"38b9be7163a17062a16fe5765fdec077c6ab520a","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1948\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nA consistent `flowExecutionId` is used during lease arbitration between hosts and that id is available to the `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor` but not used when passing `launch` events to the `Orchestrator` for recompilation and eventual execution. The unintended consequence of this is that a different `flowExecutionId` will be used across each participant when the flow is recompiled before passing to the `DagManager`. This messes up the job status of the most recent flow execution of each flow as it appears there are `N flow execution Ids`, 1 for each of the `N` hosts. Only one will be executed but the other `N-1` are stuck in `\"compiling\"` job status state.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests `addProperty` method added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-02T18:55:07Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T17:51:06Z","closed_at":"2023-11-03T17:51:05Z","merged_at":"2023-11-03T17:51:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b6b70ce7b6a2d23b9b2903bbc566e5189c7968b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3819/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3819/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3819/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b116762b334d72bc4260846d5c1d562287001738","head":{"label":"umustafi:unifyFlowExecutionIdAcrossHosts","ref":"unifyFlowExecutionIdAcrossHosts","sha":"b116762b334d72bc4260846d5c1d562287001738","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1946\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd basic unit testing framework for `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor.processMessage()` function which is used for processing `launch`, `kill`, and `resume` flow action events. This is a crucial piece of functionality used to launch events, so it needs to be resilient to malformed message types and handle them without interrupting the thread processing the queue. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests calling process message on HEARTBEAT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operation types. The main functionality we seek to test is to ensure heartbeat type messages or messages with null dag action types are handled without throwing a `NullPointerException`. The unit tests are rudimentary other than the aforementioned functionality, mocking all related classes so their states and the actual result of processing the message is not validated at the moment. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-01T21:40:53Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T18:06:01Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T18:06:01Z","merged_at":"2023-11-08T18:06:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"5339332d9c0d0651c7a1d3f8c07ea96a1bc6d4ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3817/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3817/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3817/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e6b87d00a0d97d2b5c2da89478a76f1b712e6a56","head":{"label":"umustafi:dagActionMonitorTesting","ref":"dagActionMonitorTesting","sha":"e6b87d00a0d97d2b5c2da89478a76f1b712e6a56","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1945\r\n   \r\n\"Implement Gobblin-on-Temporal WorkUnit Evaluation\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nevaluate/execute Gobblin `Workunit`s atop Temporal.io.  to begin we may 'borrow' WUs created  by other platforms, such as the `MRJobLauncher`.  eventually we'll likely add the ability for Gobblin-on-Temporal to generate `WorkUnit`s of its own.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nmultiple manual executions\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-01T00:36:05Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T06:41:46Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T06:41:45Z","merged_at":"2023-11-01T06:41:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"6f5199d8476fb74879725d8a93e8dc6d080cb0a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/81d69667de9cae18ce8e1c13c1b75bbb4e9b0482","head":{"label":"phet:temporal-wu-eval","ref":"temporal-wu-eval","sha":"81d69667de9cae18ce8e1c13c1b75bbb4e9b0482","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1944\r\n   \r\n\"Create Gobblin-Temporal load-generator to de-risk Temporal's scaling\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nTo de-risk Temporal as an effective platform for executing Gobblin jobs, we wish to validate that temporal workflows can scale-up to a Big Data number of activities.  To accomplish such load testing, we provide a simple load-generator for creating nesting workflows that ultimately subsume whatever desired number of activities.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nmanual execution already north of 1M activities/workflow\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1933\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n1. Change the logic in completeness verifier to support multi reference tier and use the lowest completeness percentage as the result. In other words, we will wait until src tier catches up to all reference tiers (upto 99.9%) to mark that hour as completed.\r\n2. Change the default topic partition number to be configurable as 10 is fair small and can cause us to allocate resources aggressively\r\n3.  Add log for consumption rate to help debugging\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    4. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    5. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    6. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    7. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    8. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-24T17:56:21Z","updated_at":"2023-10-28T02:24:53Z","closed_at":"2023-10-28T02:24:52Z","merged_at":"2023-10-28T02:24:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"65ddfedc4062992f1e34d104c941dc36d2d9ed8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3806/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3806/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3806/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e2a3491f08cb4a1e6efa71ad716fa00d3ffb21da","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1933","ref":"GOBBLIN-1933","sha":"e2a3491f08cb4a1e6efa71ad716fa00d3ffb21da","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1932\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR adds in a customer partitioner that is used to determine whether the record should exist in directory A or directory B based on the timestamp of the record itself. This is needed when migration from aggregate cluster ingestion to local cluster ingestion cutover.\r\nIf pipeline ingesting from aggregate cluster, partitioning should include the consumption backup directory prefix if record is **after** the cutover timestamp, otherwise when **before**, use the production consumption directory prefix.\r\nIf pipeline ingesting from local cluster, partitioning should include the consumption backup directory prefix if the record is **prior** to the cutover timestamp, otherwise when **after**, use the production consumption directory prefix.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdds test for a record with timestamp before and a record with timestamp after the cutover time to ensure that the partitioning is correct. The partitioning is whether the cluster is from aggregate cluster or local cluster\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-19T21:23:24Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T19:16:11Z","closed_at":"2023-11-06T19:16:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6d2d55bbd22c75597ed71dd1d396d9781aa38ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3803/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3803/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3803/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b4aedbc645ff44da8fea73a971868f3cfad8be60","head":{"label":"AndyJiang99:andjiang/local-consumption-custom-partitioner","ref":"andjiang/local-consumption-custom-partitioner","sha":"b4aedbc645ff44da8fea73a971868f3cfad8be60","user":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364428142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ0MjgxNDI=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"AndyJiang99/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1930\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nImprove logging and metrics around multi-active launch flow event handling to identify any missing events between the `MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter` committing the launch event to the `dagActionStore` and the `DagActionMonitor` receiving events for processing. We want to be able to distinguish between the following cases of \r\n\r\n- events that are never received by the `DagActionMonitor`\r\n- events incorrectly filtered out by the `DagActionMonitor`\r\n- any failed submissions of dags to the `DagManager` either upon leader change or from the `DagActionChangeMonitor`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-12T22:22:44Z","updated_at":"2023-10-17T23:33:33Z","closed_at":"2023-10-17T23:33:32Z","merged_at":"2023-10-17T23:33:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"eeb51428ccbc7231a2831c26888827c043cdf3c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/afaedbe3f5404c8f2d74c94e4fbf249059ace57d","head":{"label":"umustafi:improveMALogsAndMetrics","ref":"improveMALogsAndMetrics","sha":"afaedbe3f5404c8f2d74c94e4fbf249059ace57d","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1929\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nI want to implement the dataset path for `IcebergDataset` and `RecursiveCopyableDataset` which previously would resolve to empty `String`. Now, with this implementation, it would help enable `DestinationShardHandler` based on the dataset path for all distcp workflows\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-12T15:34:18Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T03:51:05Z","closed_at":"2023-11-04T03:51:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"140384e3a2c24353fee68bdf565989fa718b840c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3799/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3799/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3799/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/775dc257a1b99a53f7abd26b39f86940d17a712a","head":{"label":"meethngala:impl-dataset-path-for-distcp-workflows","ref":"impl-dataset-path-for-distcp-workflows","sha":"775dc257a1b99a53f7abd26b39f86940d17a712a","user":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":526331617,"node_id":"R_kgDOH18u4Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"meethngala/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1922] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1922\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd a new feature in Kafka source to create workUnit for selected topics partitions. This feature can provide functionality for:\r\n1. Recompute and split tasks(workUnit) during runtime for selected topics partitions, instead of recompute for all Kafka topics\r\n2. Make topic level replan feasible\r\n3. One step closer to dynamic work unit allocation \r\n\r\nNeed to have a followup to make work unit packer able to pack the recomputed workunits into a desired number of containers \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-11T18:51:25Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T17:12:58Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T17:12:58Z","merged_at":"2023-10-26T17:12:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"918716fbd7dcc4dfaef7071c058f7209d64e694b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0a351e2b36dd6842c6b373f3088ed56b9436e100","head":{"label":"hanghangliu:GOBBLIN-1922-Create-work-units-for-selected-topics-partitions-in-Kafka-source","ref":"GOBBLIN-1922-Create-work-units-for-selected-topics-partitions-in-Kafka-source","sha":"0a351e2b36dd6842c6b373f3088ed56b9436e100","user":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":264983661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjQ5ODM2NjE=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"hanghangliu/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1926\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFor a large number of reminder events, we are still seeing the event be considered distinct and launching a separate execution. Analysis of the reminder events being considered unique shows that `reminder eventTimestamps` that are well in the past are handled properly by this [case](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/e4cae2e3c559691f8b8873f81ab805c8a6482fd2/gobblin-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/runtime/api/MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter.java#L296). However, a large number of reminder events fall into the case of being exactly equal to the timestamp in the database. Those are handled improperly by falling into [CASE 6](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/e4cae2e3c559691f8b8873f81ab805c8a6482fd2/gobblin-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/runtime/api/MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter.java#L347) of the same event time lease completed yet we were considering the reminder event to be unique. This is because we were comparing the `current timestamp` in the database to the `db event timestamp` to determine uniqueness. However, we always want to utilize the `reminder event timestamp` since `linger` time will have passed and the event would be considered unique if using the former check.\r\n\r\nThe issue above can occur for multiple participants regarding the same flow and that will cause 1 participant's `reminder event` to succeed completing a new lease (which shouldn't occur in the first place) while the others continue to set `reminders` infinitely as seen by `reminder events` emitting this [log](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/e4cae2e3c559691f8b8873f81ab805c8a6482fd2/gobblin-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/runtime/api/MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter.java#L514). Upon returning to revisit the previously completed event in the database we see this unexpected [warning](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/e4cae2e3c559691f8b8873f81ab805c8a6482fd2/gobblin-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/runtime/api/MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter.java#L302C2-L302C2 \r\n) occur. The fix in this PR should address this problem as well. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded sleep time to existing unit test to find it fails with original code and after bug fix it passes. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-10T18:20:08Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T21:50:35Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T21:50:35Z","merged_at":"2023-10-10T21:50:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"9b254b6bb4322a0bdb048f19daf71022ddcccd7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/af663be14d52774c602e39f97316673016b9e6bc","head":{"label":"umustafi:fixReminderEventEpsilonComparison","ref":"fixReminderEventEpsilonComparison","sha":"af663be14d52774c602e39f97316673016b9e6bc","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A
