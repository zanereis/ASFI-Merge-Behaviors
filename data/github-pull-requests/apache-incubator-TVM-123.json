a rough draft.  There are some concerns I have already.\r\n\r\nIs this too specific to the constant folding pass?

Do they already know how to use visitors and mutators?  Or do they not know what an AST is?\r\n\r\nIs constant folding a good example?  @MarisaKirisame suggested the ANF-to-GNF pass might be a better fit.\r\n\r\nLemme know what you think and if I should

the pass two weeks, i had [prototyped](https://github.com/MarisaKirisame/PE/blob/master/bin/test.ml) a partial evaluator in metaocaml for a toy DSL with similar characteristic to relay.\r\n\r\nIt works by taking a evaluator, lifting the value to partially-static domain, reifying the store, and anfing the code generated using let list to avoid code duplication and get capture avoidance substitution for free.\r\n\r\nIt is written such that it could be translated line by line to tvm.\r\n\r\nI had wrote some test, and it can indeed remove the closure and reference #2496 generate.\r\nHowever, it does generate lots of dead code (closure, reference) that need to be remove by the dead code elimination pass. We probably need an ad hoc naive escape analysis as only write to dead variable is ok to remove.\r\n\r\nI will port this but the high level idea is ready for review: the prototype is only 336 loc (including all the DSL definition), and the core function is less then 100 line.\r\n\r\nThanks to @weberlo for reviewing the

PR addresses an issue that @MarisaKirisame brought to my attention (and indeed, resulted in a TODO in code that was merged into mainline). Namely, if a higher-order function (e.g., a polymorphic `id` function) were nested inside another function, it could cause type-checking to fail because Relay presently only supports polymorphism at the top level.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to solve that problem by instantiating any nested polymorphic types whenever they occur in type inference. As it happens, doing this inside `Unify()` in the type checker handles almost all cases, though I would appreciate any review as to whether there may be missing cases. (Or suggestions as to what might be a less clumsy approach to this problem.)","created_at":"2019-02-26T01:10:19Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T04:39:12Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T04:38:51Z","merged_at":"2019-02-27T04:38:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"d24c7eedbb9fb3853404bc799a0a243d8d2f645d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

intent for this PR is to add AutoTVM task extraction to graphs with NCHWc ops directly without needing to convert from NCHW to NCHWc manually. However, the current style of search space definition in x86 NCHWc is only suitable when we do exhaustive search. This is because the search space definition seems to override any information from graph-level optimization about data layout options, and just tries every option. Currently this works as every option is tried, but we may want more fine-grained options in the future. In other words, currently we can solve the problem of \"try every variant of NCHW[x]c for a given workload,\" but we do not really support \"try every variant of NCHW8c a given workload\" efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor issue: TOPI does not have a default declaration for the conv2d_NCHWc op (which seems to be necessary for the tracing portion of task extraction), so there is a copy-pasted from from x86 in this PR.","created_at":"2019-02-23T03:34:42Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T17:33:40Z","closed_at":"2019-04-05T22:06:02Z","merged_at":"2019-04-05T22:06:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"0708c48d85f0ba8d55b0d8c4da56e98e75644827","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

we must be careful about how the quantization pass is mixed with other optimizations, especially ones that alter both the computational graph and underlying operator implementations, such as the x86 `alter_op_layout` pass. An example pitfall is when a default `fp32` graph is constructed and optimized for x86 CPU with the intent of being quantized. If the layout transformation pass is applied in this case, the `conv2d` ops will be replaced with `conv2d_nchwc`, and the pass will silently fail because the `conv2d_nchwc` ops will not match against the quantization pass's target ops. Everything will run \"correctly,\" but the user may not be aware that an `fp32` graph is being run.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a check that the quantization pass is not being applied to a graph with `NCHWc` ops.\r\nIn general, it is a good idea to defer data layout transformation passes to be _after_ quantization, as quantization can change the sizes of the data types.","created_at":"2019-02-22T00:12:26Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T22:22:06Z","closed_at":"2019-02-22T06:29:53Z","merged_at":"2019-02-22T06:29:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"16abe31c92b20f91dc506e791726d8a3a8e9d861","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/21990d8d98ec470cda6c4d4e8e84be62215b8f69","head":{"label":"eqy:add-nchwc-check","ref":"add-nchwc-check","sha":"21990d8d98ec470cda6c4d4e8e84be62215b8f69","user":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109762891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDk3NjI4OTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"eqy/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eqy/tvm","description":"End

PR is extracted from the tensor expression autodiff PR #2498. It contains transformations required for optimizing the code generated by the autodiff. Note that although the transformations are independent from the autodiff, they aren't used anywhere else yet.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of zero elimination is to remove summation over zeros. This is achieved by \r\n1) Factoring out conditions (`LiftNonzeronessCondition` does this)\r\n2) Fusing conditions with reductions and simplifying their iteration domains (`SimplifyReductionDomain`)\r\n\r\nThe facade function which combines both these steps is `OptimizeAndLiftNonzeronessConditions`. \r\n\r\nA brief summary of functions added by the PR:\r\n* `include/tvm/ir_operator.h`\r\n  - `is_const_value` - check if an Expr is a const of the given value, works for floats as well as for ints.\r\n* `src/op/op_util.h`\r\n  - `TensorFromExpr` - create a tensor from an expr and itervars. Something like compute, but easier to use in some contexts since it automatically duplicates reductions.\r\n  - `TransformBody` - create a new tensor by transform the body of the given tensor using the given expression transforming functions.\r\n* `src/pass/zero_elimination.h`\r\n  - `IsSumCombiner` - check whether the given combiner is a sum.\r\n  - `CanFactorZeroFromCombiner` - check if we can factor out zero from the given combiner.\r\n  - `LiftNonzeronessCondition` - transform the expression into the form `select(c, e, 0)`.\r\n  - `InlineTailCall` - if the given tensor is just a call to another tensor, inline it. This function is used in the autodiff.\r\n  - `InlineTensors` - transform the given expression or tensor by inlining calls to other tensors, also used in the autodiff.\r\n  - `SolveSystemOfInequalities` - perform Fourier-Motzkin elimination.\r\n  - `SimplifyDomain` - simplify the given iteration domain using Fourier-Motzkin elimination and several other transformations.\r\n  - `SimplifyReductionDomain` - simplify the iteration domain of the given reduction using the previous function.\r\n  - `ExtractAsTensorMaybe` - extract the given expr into a separate tensor if this seems reasonable.\r\n  - `ExtractNonTopReductions` - extract non-top-level reductions as separate tensors.\r\n  - `ExtractReductions` - almost the same thing, but may also extract the given expr itself.\r\n  - `OptimizeAndLiftNonzeronessConditions` - a more powerful version of `LiftNonzeronessCondition` which also works for reductions and tries to optimize the given tensor using the above transformations (mostly by simplifying iteration domains). This is the most important function which is used by the autodiff.\r\n* `python/tvm/testing.py`\r\n  - `estimate_performance` - statically estimate performance of the given Tensor or Expr, used for regression testing.","created_at":"2019-02-20T14:40:04Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T20:54:44Z","closed_at":"2020-03-30T20:54:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b92df64a659e5cc32c24b0908e62614d20b5ad8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:
