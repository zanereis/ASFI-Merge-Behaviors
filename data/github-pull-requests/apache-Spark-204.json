If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current behavior silently overwrites the `path` option if path parameter is passed to `DataFrameWriter.save()`, `DataStreamReader.load()` and `DataStreamWriter.start()`.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nSeq(1).toDF.write.option(\"path\", \"/tmp/path1\").parquet(\"/tmp/path2\")\r\n```\r\nwill write the result to `/tmp/path2`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, if `path` option coexists with path parameter to any of the above methods, it will throw `AnalysisException`:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq(1).toDF.write.option(\"path\", \"/tmp/path1\").parquet(\"/tmp/path2\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: There is a 'path' option set and save() is called with a  path parameter. Either remove the path option, or call save() without the parameter. To ignore this check, set 'spark.sql.legacy.pathOptionBehavior.enabled' to 'true'.;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user can restore the previous behavior by setting `spark.sql.legacy.pathOptionBehavior.enabled` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently in `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase` we use deprecated APIs in a few places from Parquet, such as `readFooter`, `ParquetInputSplit`, `new ParquetFileReader`, `filterRowGroups`, etc. This replaces these with the newer APIs. In specific this:\r\n- Replaces `ParquetInputSplit` with `FileSplit`. We never use specific things in the former such as `rowGroupOffsets` so the swap is pretty simple.\r\n- Removes `readFooter` calls by using `ParquetFileReader.open`\r\n- Replace deprecated `ParquetFileReader` ctor with the newer API which takes `ParquetReadOptions`.\r\n- Removes the unnecessary handling of case when `rowGroupOffsets` is not null. It seems this never happens.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned APIs were deprecated and is going to be removed at some point in future. This is to ensure better supportability. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

current documentation states that the default value of spark.hadoop.mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version is 1 which is not entirely true since this configuration isn't set anywhere in Spark but rather inherited from the Hadoop FileOutputCommitter class.  \r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI'm submitting this change, to clarify that the default value will entirely depend on the Hadoop version of the runtime environment.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAn application would end up using algorithm version 1 on certain environments but without any changes the same exact application will use version 2 on environments running Hadoop 3.0 and later. This can have pretty bad consequences in certain scenarios, for example, two tasks can partially overwrite their output if speculation is enabled. Also, please refer to the following JIRA:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-7282\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Configuration page content was modified where previously we explicitly highlighted that the default version for the FileOutputCommitter algorithm was v1, this now has changed to \"Dependent on environment\" with additional information in the description column to elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nChecked changes locally in browser

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the minimum number of coalesced partitions is not set in AQE, we do not fall back to default parallelism but coalesce partitions towards the `advisoryTargetSize`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe default parallelism is usually the number of total executors cores which might be different across different runs of the same job when dynamic allocation is enabled. It results in uncertainty of the number of tasks after coalescing and leads to many small output files in some cases. The behavior is complex and hard to reason about.\r\n\r\nHence, I'm proposing not falling back to the default parallelism but coalescing towards the `advisoryTargetSize` when the minimum number of coalesced partitions is not set.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting Tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-25T12:58:05Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T03:10:34Z","closed_at":"2020-08-31T03:10:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6157aca2dd168ab27cec34233d771bcb6214b1a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29540/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29540/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29540/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7419be002055d41df0fe8f693d9427bec9af070e","head":{"label":"manuzhang:spark-32698","ref":"spark-32698","sha":"7419be002055d41df0fe8f693d9427bec9af070e","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132739917,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI3Mzk5MTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"manuzhang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the doc error and add a migration guide for datetime pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a bug of the doc that we inherited from JDK https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8169482\r\n\r\nThe SimpleDateFormatter(**F Day of week in month**) we used in 2.x and the DatetimeFormatter(**F week-of-month**) we use now both have the opposite meanings to what they declared in the java docs. And unfortunately, this also leads to silent data change in Spark too.\r\n\r\nThe `week-of-month` is actually the pattern `W` in DatetimeFormatter, which is banned to use in Spark 3.x.\r\n\r\nIf we want to keep pattern `F`, we need to accept the behavior change with proper migration guide and fix the doc in Spark\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, doc changed\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\npassing ci doc generating

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\npass specified options in DataFrameReader.table to JDBCTableCatalog.loadTable\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently,

The options specified like the following are lost.\r\n```\r\n    val df = spark.read\r\n      .option(\"partitionColumn\", \"id\")\r\n      .option(\"lowerBound\", \"0\")\r\n      .option(\"upperBound\", \"3\")\r\n      .option(\"numPartitions\", \"2\")\r\n      .table(\"h2.test.people\")\r\n```\r\nWe need to make `DataFrameReader.table` take the specified options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test for now.

A predicate \"a < 0\" cannot pushdown to ORC file with field name \"A\" under case-insensitive analysis.\r\n\r\nBut Parquet predicate pushdown works with this case. We should make ORC predicate pushdown work with case-insensitive analysis too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, after this PR, under case-insensitive analysis, ORC predicate pushdown will work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange to use `dataTypes.foreach` instead of get the element use specified index in `def this(dataTypes: Seq[DataType]) `constructor of

needed?\r\nI found that SPARK-32550 had some negative impact on performance, the typical cases is \"deterministic cardinality estimation\" in `HyperLogLogPlusPlusSuite` when rsd is 0.001, we found the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug of #29406. #29406 partially pushes down data filter even if it mixed in partition filters. But in some cases partition columns might be in data columns too. It will possibly push down a predicate with partition column to datasource.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Removed `foldCol` related code introduced in #29445 which is causing issues in the base branch.\r\n- Fixed `CrossValidatorModel.copy()` so that it correctly calls `.copy()` on the models instead of lists of models.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- `foldCol` is from 3.1 hence causing tests to fail.\r\n- `CrossValidatorModel.copy()` is supposed to shallow copy models not lists of models.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n- Existing tests created in #29445 ran and passed.\r\n- Updated `test_copy` to make sure `copy()` is called on models instead of lists of models.","created_at":"2020-08-23T17:42:50Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T21:32:40Z","closed_at":"2020-08-24T04:12:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c14b40483c7362b0f6861dd74ef67f6ff704d06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29524/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29524/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29524/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/989650da057cf624543d7ecb36a8b9d178c3d7fe","head":{"label":"Louiszr:remove-foldcol-3.0","ref":"remove-foldcol-3.0","sha":"989650da057cf624543d7ecb36a8b9d178c3d7fe","user":{"login":"Louiszr","id":19293269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjkzMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19293269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr","html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":287130659,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODcxMzA2NTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"Louiszr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Louiszr","id":19293269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjkzMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19293269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr","html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOverride `def get: Date` in `DaysWritable` use the `daysToMillis(int d)` from the parent class `DateWritable` instead of `long daysToMillis(int d, boolean doesTimeMatter)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt fixes failures of `HiveSerDeReadWriteSuite` with the profile `hive-1.2`. In that case, the parent class `DateWritable` has different implementation before the commit to Hive https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/da3ed68eda10533f3c50aae19731ac6d059cda87. In particular, `get()` calls `new Date(daysToMillis(daysSinceEpoch))` instead of overrided `def get(doesTimeMatter: Boolean): Date` in the child class. The `get()` method returns wrong result `1970-01-01` because it uses not updated `daysSinceEpoch`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the test suite `HiveSerDeReadWriteSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-1.2 -Phadoop-2.7 \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveSerDeReadWriteSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phadoop-2.7 \"test:testOnly

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBecause master and branch-3.0 both have few tests failed under hive-1.2 profile. And the PR #29457 missed a change in hive-1.2 code that causes compilation error. So it will make debugging the failed tests harder. I'd like revert #29457 first to unblock it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark's CSV source can optionally ignore lines starting with a comment char. Some code paths check to see if it's set before applying comment logic (i.e. not set to default of `\\0`), but many do not, including the one that passes the option to Univocity. This means that rows beginning with a null char were being treated as comments even when 'disabled'.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid dropping rows that start with a null char when this is not requested or intended. See JIRA for an example.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNothing beyond the effect of the bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests plus new test case.","created_at":"2020-08-22T22:07:45Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T04:59:11Z","closed_at":"2020-08-25T15:26:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4cd4d7bdedc5f48b4f85d461b68249333e19cc5","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29516/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29516/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29516/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b685f1c0228594965d9daca8e9796d88ecb5680f","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-32614","ref":"SPARK-32614","sha":"b685f1c0228594965d9daca8e9796d88ecb5680f","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"http

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `LiteralGenerator` for float and double datatypes was supposed to yield special values (NaN, +-inf) among others, but the `Gen.chooseNum` method does not yield values that are outside the defined range. The `Gen.chooseNum` for a wide range of floats and doubles does not yield values in the \"everyday\" range as stated in https://github.com/typelevel/scalacheck/issues/113 . \r\n\r\nThere is an similar class `RandomDataGenerator` that is used in some other tests. Added `-0.0` and `-0.0f` as special values to there too.\r\n\r\nThese changes revealed an inconsistency with the equality check between `-0.0` and `0.0`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe `LiteralGenerator` is mostly used in the `checkConsistencyBetweenInterpretedAndCodegen` method in `MathExpressionsSuite`. This change would have caught the bug fixed in #29495 .\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nLocally reverted #29495 and verified that the existing test cases caught the bug.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix ORC predicate pushdown under case-insensitive analysis case. The field names in pushed down predicates don't need to match in exact letter case with physical field names in ORC files, if we enable case-insensitive analysis.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently ORC predicate pushdown doesn't work with case-insensitive analysis. A predicate \"a < 0\" cannot pushdown to ORC file with field name \"A\" under case-insensitive analysis.\r\n\r\nBut Parquet predicate pushdown works with this case. We should make ORC predicate pushdown work with case-insensitive analysis too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, after this PR, under case-insensitive analysis, ORC predicate pushdown will work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2020-08-22T01:58:40Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:23:55Z","closed_at":"2020-08-25T04:43:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"175deba90655a319a33ec790afafd24f4b20b1b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a19e523a02b7ef39213aabb130d554839a50beeb","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-orc-pushdown-3.0","ref":"fix-orc-pushdown-3.0","sha":"a19e523a02b7ef39213aabb130d554839a50beeb","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd the option to launch external shuffle service as a sidecar on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsers with flaky jobs or who experience OOMs may loose data which was local to their executor without an external shuffle service.\r\n\r\nNote: this change does *not* help with dynamic scheduling or cluster over-commit situations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes: provides an option to enable a sidecar shuffle service.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual: verified that blocks were served from the external shuffle service sidecar\r\nAutomatic: verify the external shuffle service launches & register the associated executor and vice versa.\r\n\r\n### Whats work in progress?\r\n\r\nCode style & we might want to add some more configuration options. Also this picks up a change so the pod restarts on failure, but there is a separate PR to make that configurable it would be better to get that merged in first instead.\r\n\r\nThe restartOnFailure change is used so that if somehow the executor starts before the shuffle service, it will simply restart the executor. In Kubernetes 1.19 we might be able to mark the shuffle service as a sidecar explicitly so that it starts first, but that isn't going to be widely available soon.","created_at":"2020-08-21T21:27:58Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T00:45:49Z","closed_at":"2020-12-01T00:45:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4e65994d49b75f3fececa3cd006277509ac673c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5beeae538e35e876bf1b6a253a01faded94fbb13","head":{"label":"holdenk:investigate-ess-sidecar","ref":"investigate-ess-sidecar","sha":"5beeae538e35e876bf1b6a253a01faded94fbb13","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe analyzer rule `PreprocessTableCreation` will preprocess table creation related logical plan. But for\r\nCTAS, if the sub-query can't be resolved, preprocess it will cause \"Invalid call to toAttribute on unresolved\r\nobject\" (instead of a user-friendly error msg: \"table or view not found\").\r\nThis PR fixes this wrongly preprocess for CTAS using V2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe error message for CTAS with a non-exists table changed from:\r\n`UnresolvedException: Invalid call to toAttribute on unresolved object, tree: xxx` to\r\n`AnalysisException: Table or view not found: xxx`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis fixed SPARK-32672 a data corruption.  Essentially the BooleanBitSet CompressionScheme would miss nulls at the end of a CompressedBatch.  The values would then default to false.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt fixes data corruption\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI manually tested it against the original issue that was producing errors for me.  I also added in a unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis adds some tuning guide for increasing parallelism of directory listing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSometimes when job input has large number of directories, the listing can become a bottleneck. There are a few parameters to tune this. This adds some info to Spark tuning guide to make the knowledge better shared.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nGroup all messages of `AnalysisExcpetions` created and thrown directly in org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer in one file.  \r\n* Create a new object: `org.apache.spark.sql.CatalystErrors` with many exception-creating functions.\r\n* When the `Analyzer` wants to create and throw a new `AnalysisException`, call functions of `CatalystErrors`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is the sample PR that groups exception messages together in several files. It will largely help with standardization of error messages and its maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Error messages remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNo new tests - pass all original tests to make sure it doesn't break any existing behavior.\r\n\r\n### Naming of exception functions\r\n\r\nAll function names ended with `Error`.\r\n* For specific errors like `groupingIDMismatch` and `groupingColInvalid`, directly use them as name, just like `groupingIDMismatchError` and `groupingColInvalidError`.\r\n* For generic errors like `dataTypeMismatch`, \r\n  * if confident with the context, prefix and condition can be added, like `pivotValDataTypeMismatchError`\r\n  * if not sure about the context, add a `For` suffix of the specific component that this exception is related to, like

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27860 to downgrade Janino, as the new version has a bug.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe symptom is about NaN comparison. For code below\r\n```\r\nif (double_value <= 0.0) {\r\n  ...\r\n} else {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `double_value` is NaN, `NaN <= 0.0` is false and we should go to the else branch. However, current Spark goes to the if branch and causes correctness issues like SPARK-32640.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix it is:\r\n```\r\nboolean cond = double_value <= 0.0;\r\nif (cond) {\r\n  ...\r\n} else {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Janino so I don't know what's going on there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fix correctness bugs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd document to `ExpressionEvalHelper`, and ask people to explore all the cases that can lead to null results (including null in struct fields, array elements and map values).\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes `ComplexTypeSuite.GetArrayStructFields` to explore all the null cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt happened several times that we hit correctness bugs caused by wrong expression nullability. When writing unit tests, we usually don't test the nullability flag directly, and it's too late to add such tests for all expressions.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22375, we extended the expression test framework, which checks the nullability flag when the expected result/field/element is null.\r\n\r\nThis requires the test cases to explore all the cases that can lead to null results \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI reverted https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5d296ed39e3dd79ddb10c68657e773adba40a5e0 locally, and `ComplexTypeSuite` can catch the bug.","created_at":"2020-08-20T15:17:28Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T21:24:07Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T21:23:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7433db708c9ff265080188b0a2ed0752039c4f7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29493/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29493/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29493/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9686eebf5a79dbf2e0ce6cfc1e2bf516173b1cfa","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:small","ref":"small","sha":"9686eebf5a79dbf2e0ce6cfc1e2bf516173b1cfa","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemoving the individual `close` method calls on the pooled `TransportClient` instances. \r\nThe pooled clients should be only closed via `TransportClientFactory#close()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nReusing a closed `TransportClient` leads to the exception `java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial case which is not tested by specific

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to:\r\n- add a notebook with a Binder integration which allows users to try PySpark in a live notebook. Please [try this here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HyukjinKwon/spark/SPARK-32204?filepath=python%2Fdocs%2Fsource%2Fgetting_started%2Fquickstart.ipynb).\r\n- reuse this notebook as a quickstart guide in PySpark documentation.\r\n\r\nNote that Binder turns a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks. It works based on Docker image. Once somebody builds, other people can reuse the image against a specific commit.\r\nTherefore, if we run Binder with the images based on released tags in Spark, virtually all users can instantly launch the Jupyter notebooks.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nI made a simple demo to make it easier to review. Please see:\r\n- [Main page](https://hyukjin-spark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Note that the link (\"Live Notebook\") in the main page wouldn't work since this PR is not merged yet.\r\n- [Quickstart page](https://hyukjin-spark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/quickstart.html)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the notebook file itself, please give my direct feedback which I will appreciate and address.\r\nAnother way might be:\r\n- open [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HyukjinKwon/spark/SPARK-32204?filepath=python%2Fdocs%2Fsource%2Fgetting_started%2Fquickstart.ipynb).\r\n- edit / change / update the notebook. Please feel free to change as whatever you want. I can apply as are or slightly update more when I apply to this PR.\r\n- download it as a `.ipynb` file:\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2020-08-20 at 10 12 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/90774311-3e38c800-e332-11ea-8476-699a653984db.png)\r\n- upload the `.ipynb` file here in a GitHub comment. Then, I will push a commit with that file with crediting correctly, of course.\r\n- alternatively, push a commit into this PR right away if that's easier for you (if you're a committer).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html\r\n- https://databricks.com/jp/blog/2020/03/31/10-minutes-from-pandas-to-koalas-on-apache-spark.html - my own blog post .. :-) and https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/10min.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve PySpark's usability. The current quickstart for Python users are very friendly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will add a documentation page, and expose a live notebook to PySpark users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManually tested, and GitHub Actions builds will test.","created_at":"2020-08-20T12:53:52Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:50Z","closed_at":"2020-08-26T03:23:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a36540b0386436a97d737a5f55c361797fa8f830","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e114b6ac47cde46467d18dce2ca8e1ac0650a35","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32204","ref":"SPARK-32204","sha":"0e114b6ac47cde46467d18dce2ca8e1ac0650a35","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse `initialize(StructObjectInspector argOIs)` instead `initialize(ObjectInspector[] args)` in `HiveGenericUDTF`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn our case, we implement a Hive `GenericUDTF` and override `initialize(StructObjectInspector argOIs)`. Then it's ok to execute with Hive, but failed with Spark SQL. Here is the Spark SQL error msg:\r\n```\r\nNo handler for UDF/UDAF/UDTF 'com.xxxx.xxxUDTF': java.lang.IllegalStateException: \r\nShould not be called directly Please make sure your function overrides \r\n`public StructObjectInspector initialize(ObjectInspector[] args)`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is Spark `HiveGenericUDTF` call `initialize(ObjectInspector[] argOIs)` to init a UDTF, but it's a Deprecated method.\r\n```\r\n    public StructObjectInspector initialize(StructObjectInspector argOIs) throws UDFArgumentException {\r\n        List<? extends StructField> inputFields = argOIs.getAllStructFieldRefs();\r\n        ObjectInspector[] udtfInputOIs = new ObjectInspector[inputFields.size()];\r\n\r\n        for(int i = 0; i < inputFields.size(); ++i) {\r\n            udtfInputOIs[i] = ((StructField)inputFields.get(i)).getFieldObjectInspector();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return this.initialize(udtfInputOIs);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Deprecated\r\n    public StructObjectInspector initialize(ObjectInspector[] argOIs) throws UDFArgumentException {\r\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Should not be called directly\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should use `initialize(StructObjectInspector argOIs)` to do this so that we can be compatible both of the two method. Same as Hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fix UDTF initialize method.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nmanual test and passed

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29469\r\n\r\nInstead of passing the physical plan to the fallbacked v1 source directly and skipping analysis, optimization, planning altogether, this PR proposes to pass the optimized plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a bit risky to pass the physical plan directly. When the fallbacked v1 source applies more operations to the input DataFrame, it will re-apply the post-planning physical rules like `CollapseCodegenStages`, `InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan`, etc., which is very tricky.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting test suite with some new

Attribute(s) with the same name appear in the operation: v.

We don't need to execute stream side plan at all, and can return an empty iterator (for inner join and left semi join), because we know for sure that none of stream side rows can be outputted as there's no match.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe strict requirement for the vocabulary to remain non-empty has been removed in this pull request.\r\n\r\nLink to the discussion: http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/Ability-to-have-CountVectorizerModel-vocab-as-empty-td38396.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis soothens running it across the corner cases. Without this, the user has to manupulate the data in genuine case, which may be a perfectly fine valid use-case.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Should we a log when empty vocabulary is found instead?\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nMay be a slight change. If someone has put a try-catch to detect an empty vocab. Then that behavior would no longer stand still.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Added testcase to `fit` generating an empty vocabulary\r\n2. Added testcase to `transform` with empty vocabulary\r\n\r\nRequest to review: @srowen @hhbyyh

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is backporting #29437 to branch-3.0.\r\n\r\nWhen CSV/JSON datasources infer schema (e.g, `def inferSchema(files: Seq[FileStatus])`, they use the `files` along with the original options. `files` in `inferSchema` could have been deduced from the \"path\" option if the option was present, so this can cause issues (e.g., reading more data, listing the path again) since the \"path\" option is **added** to the `files`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current behavior can cause the following issue:\r\n```scala\r\nclass TestFileFilter extends PathFilter {\r\n  override def accept(path: Path): Boolean = path.getParent.getName != \"p=2\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nval path = \"/tmp\"\r\nval df = spark.range(2)\r\ndf.write.json(path + \"/p=1\")\r\ndf.write.json(path + \"/p=2\")\r\n\r\nval extraOptions = Map(\r\n  \"mapred.input.pathFilter.class\" -> classOf[TestFileFilter].getName,\r\n  \"mapreduce.input.pathFilter.class\" -> classOf[TestFileFilter].getName\r\n)\r\n\r\n// This works fine.\r\nassert(spark.read.options(extraOptions).json(path).count == 2)\r\n\r\n// The following with \"path\" option fails with the following:\r\n// assertion failed: Conflicting directory structures detected. Suspicious paths\r\n//\tfile:/tmp\r\n//\tfile:/tmp/p=1\r\nassert(spark.read.options(extraOptions).format(\"json\").option(\"path\", path).load.count() === 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the above failure doesn't happen and you get the consistent experience when you use `spark.read.csv(path)` or `spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"path\", path).load`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-08-19T17:37:25Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T17:18:51Z","closed_at":"2020-08-20T17:18:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6193b51caee02c8ce1f388a60f37e78b6248493e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ee739a100f4bb044f299dad61f0492077747a03e","head":{"label":"imback82:backport-29437","ref":"backport-29437","sha":"ee739a100f4bb044f299dad61f0492077747a03e","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOff-heap memory allocations are configured using `spark.memory.offHeap.enabled=true` and `conf spark.memory.offHeap.size=<size>`. Spark on YARN adds the off-heap memory size to the executor container resources. Spark on Kubernetes does not request the allocation of the off-heap memory. This PR proposes to make Spark on Kubernetes behave as Spark on YARN, that is by adding spark.memory.offHeap.size to the memory request for executor containers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, this issue can be worked around by using `spark.executor.memoryOverhead` to reserve memory for off-heap allocations. This PR proposes to provide a more clean solution and align with Spark on YARN.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes: when running on K8S, the memory specifies in `spark.memory.offHeap.size` will be added to the executor container memory request.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested on a K8S cluster + a unit test is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse `InSet` expression to fix data issue when pruning DPP on non-atomic type. for example:\r\n   ```scala\r\n    spark.range(1000)\r\n    .select(col(\"id\"), col(\"id\").as(\"k\"))\r\n    .write\r\n    .partitionBy(\"k\")\r\n    .format(\"parquet\")\r\n    .mode(\"overwrite\")\r\n    .saveAsTable(\"df1\");\r\n\r\n   spark.range(100)\r\n   .select(col(\"id\"), col(\"id\").as(\"k\"))\r\n   .write\r\n   .partitionBy(\"k\")\r\n   .format(\"parquet\")\r\n   .mode(\"overwrite\")\r\n   .saveAsTable(\"df2\")\r\n\r\n   spark.sql(\"set spark.sql.optimizer.dynamicPartitionPruning.fallbackFilterRatio=2\")\r\n   spark.sql(\"set spark.sql.optimizer.dynamicPartitionPruning.reuseBroadcastOnly=false\")\r\n

changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix data issue\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `count` in `PartitionWriterStream` should be a long value, instead of int. The issue is introduced by apache/spark@abef84a . When the overflow happens, the shuffle index file would record wrong index of a reduceId, thus lead to `FetchFailedException: Stream is corrupted` error.\r\n\r\nBesides the fix, I also added some debug logs, so in the future it's easier to debug similar issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a regression and bug fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA Spark user reported this issue when migrating their workload to 3.0. One of the jobs fail deterministically on Spark 3.0 without the patch, and the job succeed after applied the fix.","created_at":"2020-08-19T06:54:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T16:42:39Z","closed_at":"2020-08-20T07:08:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c216c4e5823b7e40471927bae5631351f7e4d28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dd38f6d1bf348e419108f88eac1b8207c9c792f0","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:fixPartitionWriteStream","ref":"fixPartitionWriteStream","sha":"dd38f6d1bf348e419108f88eac1b8207c9c792f0","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n#28123 and #29079 introduced coalescing bucketed tables for sort merge join / shuffled hash join.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce repartitioning bucketed tables to increase parallelism at the cost of reading duplicate source data. It is applied if the following conditions are met:\r\n* Join is sort merge join or shuffled hash join.\r\n* Join keys match with output partition expressions on their respective sides.\r\n* The larger bucket count is divisible by the smaller bucket count.\r\n* `spark.sql.sources.bucketing.readStrategyInJoin` is set to `repartition`.\r\n* The ratio of the number of buckets should be less than the value set in `spark.sql.sources.bucketing.readStrategyInJoin.maxBucketRatio`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCoalescing buckets is useful but repartitioning can also help due to the increased parallelism depending on the workloads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. If the bucket repartitioning conditions explained above are met, a full shuffle can be eliminated (also note that you will see `SelectedBucketsCount: 4 out of 4 (Repartitioned to 8)` in the physical plan):\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold\", \"0\")\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.sources.bucketing.readStrategyInJoin\", \"repartition\")\r\nval df1 = (0 until 20).map(i => (i % 5, i % 13, i.toString)).toDF(\"i\", \"j\", \"k\")\r\nval df2 = (0 until 20).map(i => (i % 7, i % 11, i.toString)).toDF(\"i\", \"j\", \"k\")\r\ndf1.write.format(\"parquet\").bucketBy(8, \"i\").saveAsTable(\"t1\")\r\ndf2.write.format(\"parquet\").bucketBy(4, \"i\").saveAsTable(\"t2\")\r\nval t1 = spark.table(\"t1\")\r\nval t2 = spark.table(\"t2\")\r\nval joined = t1.join(t2, t1(\"i\") === t2(\"i\"))\r\njoined.explain\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(3) SortMergeJoin [i#38], [i#44], Inner\r\n:- *(1) Sort [i#38 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- *(1) Filter isnotnull(i#38)\r\n:     +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n:        +- FileScan parquet default.t1[i#38,j#39,k#40] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#38)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int,k:string>, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n+- *(2) Sort [i#44 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- *(2) Filter isnotnull(i#44)\r\n      +- FileScan parquet default.t2[i#44,j#45,k#46] Batched: false, DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#44)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int,k:string>, SelectedBucketsCount: 4 out of 4 (Repartitioned to 8)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

Along the process this also did some cleanups/refactorings:\r\n\r\n- Created a `HadoopFSUtils` class under core\r\n- Moved `InMemoryFileIndex.bulkListLeafFiles` into `HadoopFSUtils.parallelListLeafFiles`. It now depends on a `SparkContext` instead of `SparkSession` in SQL. Also added a few parameters which used to be read from `SparkSession.conf`: `ignoreMissingFiles`, `ignoreLocality`, `parallelismThreshold`, `parallelismMax ` and `filterFun` (for additional filtering support but we may be able to merge this with `filter` parameter in future).\r\n- Moved `InMemoryFileIndex.listLeafFiles` into `HadoopFSUtils.listLeafFiles` with similar changes above.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the locality-aware parallel listing mechanism only applies to `InMemoryFileIndex`. By moving this to core, we can potentially reuse the same mechanism for other code paths as well. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince this is mostly a refactoring, it relies on existing unit tests such as those for `InMemoryFileIndex`.","created_at":"2020-08-18T23:03:22Z","updated_at":"2020-09-24T18:03:35Z","closed_at":"2020-09-24T17:59:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"64a680a70966997b67b543ff8cea0ca3a6e70d93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d8e64d72a014ed5067be5772f8b2db9129ce2f2","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-32381","ref":"SPARK-32381","sha":"2d8e64d72a014ed5067be5772f8b2db9129ce2f2","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a LogicalNode AlreadyPlanned, and related physical plan and preparation rule.\r\n\r\nWith the DataSourceV2 write operations, we have a way to fallback to the V1 writer APIs using InsertableRelation. The gross part is that we're in physical land, but the InsertableRelation takes a logical plan, so we have to pass the logical plans to these physical nodes, and then potentially go through re-planning. This re-planning can cause issues for an already optimized plan.\r\n\r\nA useful primitive could be specifying that a plan is ready for execution through a logical node AlreadyPlanned. This would wrap a physical plan, and then we can go straight to execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid having a physical plan that is disconnected from the physical plan that is being executed in V1WriteFallback execution. When a physical plan node executes a logical plan, the inner query is not connected to the running physical plan. The physical plan that actually runs is not visible through the Spark UI and its metrics are not exposed. In some cases, the EXPLAIN plan doesn't show it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNope\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nV1FallbackWriterSuite tests that writes still

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd decommissioning status checking for a host or executor while checking it's active or not. And a decommissioned host or executor should be considered as inactive.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this PR is not a correctness bug fix but gives improvement indeed. And the main problem here we want to fix is that a decommissioned host or executor should be considered as inactive.\r\n\r\n`TaskSetManager.computeValidLocalityLevels` depends on `TaskSchedulerImpl.isExecutorAlive/hasExecutorsAliveOnHost` to calculate the locality levels. Therefore, the `TaskSetManager` could also get corresponding locality levels of those decommissioned hosts or executors if they're not considered as inactive. However, on the other side,  `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` won't construct the `WorkerOffer` for those decommissioned executors. That also means `TaskSetManager` might never have a chance to launch tasks at certain locality levels but only suffers the unnecessary delay because of delay scheduling. So, this PR helps to reduce this kind of unnecessary delay by making decommissioned host/executor inactive in `TaskSchedulerImpl`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-18T16:54:00Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T01:45:48Z","closed_at":"2020-08-20T12:00:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4f8f09ef5fec7d7762af26481fa04176aa7e36d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29468/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29468/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29468/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/65f6e0525b2d1472c1e6956587253e5ae6263676","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-decom-alive","ref":"fix-decom-alive","sha":"65f6e0525b2d1472c1e6956587253e5ae6263676","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRename `spark.worker.decommission.enabled` to `spark.decommission.enabled` and move it from `org.apache.spark.internal.config.Worker` to `org.apache.spark.internal.config.package`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDecommission has been supported in Standalone and k8s yet and may be supported in Yarn(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27636) in the future. Therefore, the switch configuration should have the highest hierarchy rather than belongs to Standalone's Worker. In other words, it should be independent of the cluster managers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, as the decommission feature hasn't been released.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existed tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-18T14:06:14Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T06:53:20Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T06:53:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6640e3a0d622480532163895d20b4154cdae0c79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984378631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0Mzc4NjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAM","name":"DSTREAM","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4c0ef4458072cfbe4dfa3b23c1f32b340e36f9a","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-decom-conf","ref":"fix-decom-conf","sha":"c4c0ef4458072cfbe4dfa3b23c1f32b340e36f9a","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to update the doc (both SS guide doc and Dataset dropDuplicates method doc) to leave a note to check on using SQL statements with streaming Dataset.\r\n\r\nOnce end users create a temp view based on streaming Dataset, they won't bother with thinking about \"streaming\" and do whatever they do with batch query. In many cases it works, but not just smoothly for the case when streaming aggregation is involved. They still need to concern about maintaining state store.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough SPARK-32456 fixed the weird error message, as a side effect some operations are enabled

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix ORC predicate pushdown under case-insensitive analysis case. The field names in pushed down predicates don't need to match in exact letter case with physical field names in ORC files, if we enable case-insensitive analysis.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently ORC predicate pushdown doesn't work with case-insensitive analysis. A predicate \"a < 0\" cannot pushdown to ORC file with field name \"A\" under case-insensitive analysis.\r\n\r\nBut Parquet predicate pushdown works with this case. We should make ORC predicate pushdown work with case-insensitive analysis too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, after this PR, under case-insensitive analysis, ORC predicate pushdown will work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to generate JUnit XML test report in SparkR tests that can be leveraged in both Jenkins and GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\n**GitHub

Currently non-ascii codes are broken in Jenkins console and switching it to \"summary\" can work around it.\r\n\"summary\" is the default format used in testthat 1.x.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo check the test failures more easily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt is tested in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn [SPARK-32290](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32290), we managed to optimize NAAJ scenario from BNLJ to BHJ, but skipped the checking the BuildSide plan with `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` parameter, which means in very bad case, BuildSide Plan being too big might cause Driver OOM. So the NAAJ support for ShuffledHashJoin is important as well.\r\n\r\nThe support of SHJ for NAAJ has some difficulties in NullKey scenario, as for normal HashedRelation and EmtpyHashedRelation, the code logical should be the same when it comes to BHJ and SHJ, but if NullKey exists in global BuildSide data, and only one partition could be built into EmptyHashedRelationWithAllNullKeys, and this partition was not able to do `fast stop` for the entire RDD. So after offline talked with some committers and discussion, decided to support NAAJ for SHJ when AQE is on, because when AQE is on, Shuffle will be pre-executed, and we should be able to know that whether the BuildSide contains NullKey or not before the actual JOIN executed.\r\n\r\nBasically, In NAAJ SHJ Implementation, we collected information whether BuildSide is Empty or contains NullKey, and keep these information in ShuffleExchangeExec Metrics, and during AQE, we rewritten these two case into LocalTableScan and StreamedSidePlan to Avoid NAAJ, as for the normal relation, we processed it in Distributed style.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf BuildSide plan is too big in NAAJ scenario, it might cause Driver OOM, distributed implementation for NAAJ (ShuffledHashJoin) is neccesary. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* added case in AdaptiveQueryExecSuite.\r\n* updated case in SubquerySuite.\r\n*

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe decommissioning state is a bit fragment across two places in the TaskSchedulerImpl:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29014/ stored the incoming decommission info messages in TaskSchedulerImpl.executorsPendingDecommission.\r\nWhile https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28619/ was storing just the executor end time in the map TaskSetManager.tidToExecutorKillTimeMapping (which in turn is contained in TaskSchedulerImpl).\r\nWhile the two states are not really overlapping, it's a bit of a code hygiene concern to save this state in two places. \r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29422, TaskSchedulerImpl is emerging as the place where all decommissioning book keeping is kept within the driver. So consolidate the information in _tidToExecutorKillTimeMapping_ into _executorsPendingDecommission_. \r\n\r\nHowever, in order to do so, we need to walk away from keeping the raw ExecutorDecommissionInfo messages and instead keep another class ExecutorDecommissionState. This decoupling will allow the RPC message class ExecutorDecommissionInfo to evolve independently from the book keeping ExecutorDecommissionState.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is just a code cleanup. These two features were added independently and its time to consolidate their state for good hygiene.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove the assertion in ParquetSchemaConverter that the parquet mapKey field must be PrimitiveType.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is a parquet file in the attachment of [SPARK-32639](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32639), and the MessageType recorded in the file is:\r\n```\r\nmessage parquet_schema {\r\n  optional group value (MAP) {\r\n    repeated group key_value {\r\n      required group key {\r\n        optional binary first (UTF8);\r\n        optional binary middle (UTF8);\r\n        optional binary last (UTF8);\r\n      }\r\n      optional binary value (UTF8);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `spark.read.parquet(\"000.snappy.parquet\")` to read the file. Spark will throw an exception when converting Parquet MessageType to Spark SQL StructType:\r\n\r\n> AssertionError(Map key type is expected to be a primitive type, but found...)\r\n\r\nUse `spark.read.schema(\"value MAP<STRUCT<first:STRING, middle:STRING, last:STRING>, STRING>\").parquet(\"000.snappy.parquet\")` to read the file, spark returns the correct result .\r\n\r\nAccording to the parquet project document (https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#maps), the mapKey in the parquet format does not need to be a primitive type.\r\n\r\nNote: This parquet file is not written by spark, because spark will write additional sparkSchema string information in the parquet file. When Spark reads, it will directly use the additional sparkSchema information in the file instead of converting Parquet MessageType to Spark SQL StructType.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRevert SPARK-32018 related changes in branch 3.0: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29125 and  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29404\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29404 is made to fix correctness regression introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29125. However, the behavior of decimal overflow is strange in non-ansi mode:\r\n1. from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1: decimal overflow will throw exceptions instead of returning null on decimal overflow\r\n2. from 3.0.1 to 3.1.0: decimal overflow will return null instead of throwing exceptions.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR proposes to revert both https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29404 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29125. So that Spark will return null on decimal overflow in Spark 3.0.0 and Spark 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Spark will return null on decimal overflow in Spark 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the usage of my own forks and use the original plugins in GitHub Actions testing report.\r\n\r\nSPARK-32357 introduced the GitHub Actions test reporting by leveraging two plugins:\r\n - [ScaCap/action-surefire-report](https://github.com/ScaCap/action-surefire-report)\r\n - [dawidd6/action-download-artifact](https://github.com/dawidd6/action-download-artifact)\r\n\r\nIn order to make it working, it had to fork two repositories with custom fixes:\r\n  - HyukjinKwon/action-surefire-report@c96094c\r\n  - https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/action-download-artifact/commit/f86c565d52095e547b552eb46ba8e0696f6117f8\r\n\r\nThe two custom fixes are thankfully merged at https://github.com/ScaCap/action-surefire-report/pull/14 and https://github.com/dawidd6/action-download-artifact/pull/24, and they released new ones to use at [ScaCap/action-surefire-report/commits/v1](https://github.com/ScaCap/action-surefire-report/commits/v1) and [dawidd6/action-download-artifact/commits/v2](https://github.com/dawidd6/action-download-artifact/commits/v2)  - thanks @jmisur and @dawidd6 again.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid relying on forks and code duplications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLogically there is no diff.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis fix is trying to prevent NullPointerException caused by Null error message by wrapping the message with Option and using getOrElse to handle Null value.\r\n\r\nThe possible reason why the error message would be null is that java Throwable allows the detailMessage to be null. However, in the render code we assume that the error message would be be null and try to do indexOf() on the string. Therefore, if some exception doesn't set the error message, it would trigger NullPointerException in the hive ThriftServer UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo prevent NullPointerException caused by Null error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser would see blank message instead of a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual Testing.\r\n\r\nFor normal behavior, this change would not change anything.\r\n![37435401-658510a8-27a0-11e8-8f8b-00271fd3ef58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30429546/90350571-93f83200-e00b-11ea-9ff3-3b315d2114cc.png)\r\n\r\nTo test the null case, we manually set detail to be null in code.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt will make driver OOM if `spark.sql.optimizer.dynamicPartitionPruning.reuseBroadcastOnly` is disabled and build side have many results. We can use Bloom Filter to avoid this bottleneck and improve performance.\r\n\r\nPlease see the comparison chart below:\r\nnum Items(Long type) | Bloom Filter(ms) | hash set(ms) | sizeOf Bloom Filter(bytes) | sizeOf hash set(bytes)\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n10 | 6635 | 4147 | 80 | 720\r\n100 | 7374 | 3908 | 160 | 6720\r\n1000 | 7490 | 5095 | 984 | 64288\r\n10000 | 7533 | 4196 | 9192 | 625632\r\n100000 | 7838 | 5154 | 91296 | 6648672\r\n1000000 | 8950 | 8425 | 912376 | 64388704\r\n5000000 | 10465 | 25624 | 4561592 | 313554528\r\n10000000 | 19287 | 104596 | 9123120 | 627108960\r\n\r\nBut the larger the expectedNumItems, the slower the Bloom Filter build, Please see the comparison chart below:\r\n\r\nNumber of Bloom Filter items | Build using UDAF time(ms) | Collect to driver build time(ms)\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n1000 | 842 | 640\r\n10000 | 1086 | 810\r\n10000000 | 6265 | 11457\r\n30000000 | 16001 | 39385\r\n50000000 | 27009 | 109192\r\n70000000 | 26540 | 111459\r\n100000000 | 27460 | N/A\r\n200000000 | 46415 | N/A\r\n\r\nSo Bloom Filter is not enough. If there are many expectedNumItems, it will work better with minimum and maximum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pr enhances `PlanDynamicPruningFilters` to use minimum, maximum and Bloom Filter if build side larger than `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nEnhance DPP.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and performance test:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(20000000000L)\r\n  .select(col(\"id\"), col(\"id\").%(2000).as(\"k\"))\r\n  .write\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChanged the definitions of `CrossValidatorModel.copy()/_to_java()/_from_java()` so that exposed parameters (i.e. parameters with `get()` methods) are copied in these methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nParameters are copied in the respective Scala interface for `CrossValidatorModel.copy()`.\r\nIt fits the semantics to persist parameters when calling `CrossValidatorModel.save()` and `CrossValidatorModel.load()` so that the user gets the same model by saving and loading it after. Not copying across `numFolds` also causes bugs like Array index out of bound and losing sub-models because this parameters will always default to 3 (as described in the JIRA ticket).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nTests for `CrossValidatorModel.copy()` and `save()`/`load()` are updated so that they check parameters before and after function calls.","created_at":"2020-08-16T14:05:04Z","updated_at":"2020-08-23T16:52:22Z","closed_at":"2020-08-22T14:27:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"138339b5b6c4e9a79ca13b2d037cad5f7fd18d75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29445/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29445/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29445/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ae74d000ac48d6e293feb4bc3dac31088bf6c6c","head":{"label":"Louiszr:master","ref":"master","sha":"8ae74d000ac48d6e293feb4bc3dac31088bf6c6c","user":{"login":"Louiszr","id":19293269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjkzMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19293269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr","html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":287130659,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODcxMzA2NTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"Louiszr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Louiszr","id":19293269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjkzMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19293269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr","html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr/spark","description":"Apache
