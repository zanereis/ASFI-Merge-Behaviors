What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr changed the default value of `maxLinesPerFunction` into `4000`. In #18810, we had this new option to disable code generation for too long functions and I found this option only affected `Q17` and `Q66` in TPC-DS. But, `Q66` had some performance regression:\r\n\r\n```\r\nQ17 w/o #18810, 3224ms --> q17 w/#18810, 2627ms (improvement)\r\nQ66 w/o #18810, 1712ms --> q66 w/#18810, 3032ms (regression)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo keep the previous performance in TPC-DS, we better set higher value at `maxLinesPerFunction` by default.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMLlib ```LinearRegression``` supports _huber_ loss addition to _leastSquares_ loss. The huber loss objective function is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1962026/29554124-9544d198-8750-11e7-8afa-33579ec419d5.png)\r\nRefer Eq.(6) and Eq.(8) in [A robust hybrid of lasso and ridge regression](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~owen/reports/hhu.pdf). This objective is jointly convex as a function of (w, σ) ∈ R × (0,∞), we can use L-BFGS-B to solve it.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is a straight forward porting for Python scikit-learn [```HuberRegressor```](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.HuberRegressor.html). There are some differences:\r\n* We use mean loss (```lossSum/weightSum```), but sklearn uses total loss (```lossSum```).\r\n* We multiply the loss function and L2 regularization by 1/2. It does not affect the result if we multiply the whole formula by a factor, we just keep consistent with _leastSquares_ loss.\r\n\r\nSo if fitting w/o regularization, MLlib and sklearn produce the same output. If fitting w/ regularization, MLlib should set ```regParam``` divide by the number of instances to match the output of sklearn.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2017-08-22T07:43:09Z","updated_at":"2017-12-14T05:23:18Z","closed_at":"2017-12-14T05:22:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa70d81e610d29c25848867626a9e9a609bb15ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19020/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19020/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19020/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4369ffea2235ca74715b734da23d7c48e53140a","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-3181","ref":"spark-3181","sha":"d4369ffea2235ca74715b734da23d7c48e53140a","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

change initializes logging when SparkSubmit runs, using\r\na configuration that should avoid printing log messages as\r\nmuch as possible with most configurations, and adds code to\r\nrestore the Spark logging system to as close as possible to\r\nits initial state, so the Spark app being run can re-initialize\r\nlogging with its own configuration.\r\n\r\nWith that feature, some duplicate code in SparkSubmit can now\r\nbe replaced with the existing methods in the Utils class, which\r\ncould not be used before because they initialized logging. As part\r\nof that I also did some minor refactoring, moving methods that\r\nshould really belong in DependencyUtils.\r\n\r\nThe change also shuffles some code in SparkHadoopUtil so that\r\nSparkSubmit can create a Hadoop config like the rest of Spark\r\ncode, respecting the user's Spark configuration.\r\n\r\nThe behavior was verified running spark-shell, pyspark and\r\nnormal applications, then verifying the logging behavior,\r\nwith and without dependency downloads.","created_at":"2017-08-21T23:27:04Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T20:14:31Z","closed_at":"2017-08-29T21:45:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be4c1a742bafa7234b4618f4d609b6c652709e1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19013/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19013/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19013/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8665f7199cccef0b447bc13128c9152d5169e2a0","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-21728","ref":"SPARK-21728","sha":"8665f7199cccef0b447bc13128c9152d5169e2a0","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor Hive-serde tables, we always respect the schema stored in Hive metastore, because the schema could be altered by the other engines that share the same metastore. Thus, we always trust the metastore-controlled schema for Hive-serde tables when the schemas are different (without considering the nullability and cases). However, in some scenarios, Hive metastore also could INCORRECTLY overwrite the schemas when the serde and Hive metastore built-in serde are different.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to introduce a table-specific option for such scenarios. For a specific table, users can make Spark always respect Spark-inferred/controlled schema instead of trusting metastore-controlled schema. By default, we trust Hive metastore-controlled schema.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a cross-version test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements both read and write side changes for supporting hive bucketing in Spark. I had initially created a PR for just the write side changes (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18954) for simplicity. If reviewers want to review reader and writer side changes separately, I am happy to wait for the writer side PR to get merged and then send a new PR for reader side changes.\r\n\r\n### Semantics for read:\r\n- `outputPartitioning` while scanning hive table would be the set of bucketing columns (whether its partitioned or not, whether you are reading single partition or multiple partitions)\r\n- `outputOrdering` would be the sort columns (actually prefix subset of `sort columns` being read from the table). \r\n- In case of reading multiple hive partitions of the table, there would be multiple files per bucket so global sorting across buckets is not there. Thus we would have to ignore the sort information.\r\n- See the documentation in `HiveTableScanExec` where the `outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering` is populated for more nitty gritty details.\r\n\r\n### Semantics for write:\r\n- If the Hive table is bucketed, then INSERT node expect the child distribution to be based on the hash of the bucket columns. Else it would be empty. (Just to compare with Spark native bucketing : the required distribution is not enforced even if the table is bucketed or not... this saves the shuffle in comparison with hive).\r\n- Sort ordering for INSERT node over Hive bucketed table is determined as follows:\r\n\r\n| Table type   | Normal table | Bucketed table |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| non-partitioned insert  | Nil | sort columns |\r\n| static partition   | Nil | sort columns |\r\n| dynamic partitions   | partition columns | (partition columns + bucketId + sort columns) |\r\n\r\nJust to compare how sort ordering is expressed for Spark native bucketing:\r\n\r\n| Table type   | Normal table | Bucketed table |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  sort ordering | partition columns | (partition columns + bucketId + sort columns) |\r\n\r\nWhy is there a difference ? With hive, since there bucketed insertions would need a shuffle, sort ordering can be relaxed for both non-partitioned and static partition cases. Every RDD partition would get rows corresponding to a single bucket so those can be written to corresponding output file after sort. In case of dynamic partitions, the rows need to be routed to appropriate partition which makes it similar to Spark's constraints.\r\n\r\n- Only `Overwrite` mode is allowed for hive bucketed tables as any other mode will break the bucketing guarantees of the table. This is a difference wrt how Spark bucketing works.\r\n- With the PR, if there are no files created for empty buckets, the query will fail. Will support creation of empty files in coming iteration. This is a difference wrt how Spark bucketing works as it does NOT need files for empty buckets.\r\n\r\n### Summary of changes done:\r\n- `ClusteredDistribution` and `HashPartitioning` are modified to store the hashing function used.\r\n- `RunnableCommand`'s' can now express the required distribution and ordering. This is used by `ExecutedCommandExec` which run these commands\r\n  - The good thing about this is that I could remove the logic for enforcing sort ordering inside `FileFormatWriter` which felt out of place. Ideally, this kinda adding of physical nodes should be done within the planner which is what happens with this PR.\r\n- `InsertIntoHiveTable` enforces both distribution and sort ordering\r\n- `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` enforces sort ordering ONLY (and not the distribution)\r\n- Fixed a bug due to which any alter commands to bucketed table (eg. updating stats) would wipe out the bucketing spec from metastore. This made insertions to bucketed table non-idempotent operation.\r\n- `HiveTableScanExec` populates `outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering` based on table's metadata, configs and the query\r\n- `HadoopTableReader` to use `BucketizedSparkInputFormat` for bucketed reads\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added new unit tests","created_at":"2017-08-20T00:06:02Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T02:56:26Z","closed_at":"2018-07-26T23:51:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3ddbb45b0a1f489e6bd1afc6e354cafcfb4c7f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d37eb8b3359981756c923948fe12833a56b61865","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:bucket_read","ref":"bucket_read","sha":"d37eb8b3359981756c923948fe12833a56b61865","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implements ALTER TABLE DDL ADD CONSTRAINT  to  add  informational primary key and foreign key (referential integrity) constraints in Spark. These constraints will be used in query optimization and you can find more details about this in the spec in  [SPARK-19842](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19842)\r\n \r\nThe proposed syntax of the constraints DDL is similar to the Hive  2.1 referential integrity constraints  support (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13076) which is aligned to Oracle's semantics.\r\n \r\nSyntax:\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE [db_name.]table_name ADD [CONSTRAINT constraintName]\r\n  (PRIMARY KEY (col_names) |\r\n  FOREIGN KEY (col_names) REFERENCES [db_name.]table_name [(col_names)])\r\n  [VALIDATE | NOVALIDATE] [RELY | NORELY]\r\n```\r\nExamples :\r\n ```sql\r\nALTER TABLE employee ADD CONSTRANT pk  PRIMARY KEY(empno) VALIDATE RELY\r\nALTER TABLE department ADD CONSTRAINT emp_fk FOREIGN KEY (mgrno) REFERENCES employee(empno) NOVALIDATE NORELY\r\nALTER TABLE department ADD PRIMARY KEY(deptno) VALIDATE RELY\r\nALTER TABLE employee ADD FOREIGN KEY (workdept) REFERENCES department(deptno) VALIDATE RELY;\r\n ```\r\nThe constraint information is stored in the table properties as JSON string for each constraint. \r\nOne of the advantages of  storing constraints in the table properties is that this functionality  will work in all the supported Hive metastore versions. \r\n \r\nAn alternative approach  that we considered was to store the constraints information using the hive metastore API that stores the constraints in a separate table.  The problem with this approach is this feature will only work in Spark installations that use **Hive 2.1 metastore**, and also this version is NOT the current  spark default.  More details are in the spec document.\r\n \r\n**This PR implements the  ALTER TABLE constraint DDL using table properties because it is important to work with default hive metastore version of the spark.** \r\n \r\nThe syntax to define the  constraints as part of _create table_  definition will be implemented in a follow-up Jira.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded  new unit test cases to HiveDDLSuite, and SparkSqlParserSuite\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-18T16:48:55Z","updated_at":"2023-04-04T03:30:24Z","closed_at":"2020-02-26T00:12:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ec6369f150f15f4c52cf9d903f464491103ccd5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18994/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18994/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18994/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c126122879db0441abc8e2150d3caffa0d3b700a","head":{"label":"sureshthalamati:alter_add_pk_fk_SPARK-21784","ref":"alter_add_pk_fk_SPARK-21784","sha":"c126122879db0441abc8e2150d3caffa0d3b700a","user":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40833027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDgzMzAyNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sureshthalamati/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati/spark","description":"Mirror

Problem\r\nWhen an RDD (particularly with a low item-per-partition ratio) is repartitioned to numPartitions = power of 2, the resulting partitions are very uneven-sized, due to using fixed seed to

See details in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21782\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInstead of directly using `0, 1, 2,...` seeds to initialize `Random`,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18680#issuecomment-316820409, when we have more `ColumnVector` implementations, it might (or might not) have huge performance implications because it might disable inlining, or force virtual dispatches.\r\n\r\nAs for read path, one of the major paths is the one generated by `ColumnBatchScan`. Currently it refers `ColumnVector` so the penalty will be bigger as we have more classes, but we can know the concrete type from its usage, e.g. vectorized Parquet reader uses `OnHeapColumnVector`. We can use the concrete type in the generated code directly to avoid the penalty.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

Problem Description\r\n\r\nWhen pyspark is listed as a dependency of another package, installing\r\nthe other package will cause an install failure in pyspark. When the\r\nother package is being installed, pyspark's setup_requires requirements\r\nare installed including pypandoc. Thus, the exception handling on\r\nsetup.py:152 does not work because the pypandoc module is indeed\r\navailable. However, the pypandoc.convert() function fails if pandoc\r\nitself is not installed (in our use cases it is not). This raises an\r\nOSError that is not handled, and setup fails.\r\n\r\nThe following is a sample failure:\r\n```\r\n$ which pandoc\r\n$ pip freeze | grep pypandoc\r\npypandoc==1.4\r\n$ pip install pyspark\r\nCollecting pyspark\r\n  Downloading pyspark-2.2.0.post0.tar.gz (188.3MB)\r\n    100% |████████████████████████████████| 188.3MB 16.8MB/s\r\n    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:\r\n    Maybe try:\r\n\r\n        sudo apt-get install pandoc\r\n    See http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html\r\n    for installation options\r\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n      File \"/tmp/pip-build-mfnizcwa/pyspark/setup.py\", line 151, in <module>\r\n        long_description = pypandoc.convert('README.md', 'rst')\r\n      File \"/home/tbeck/.virtualenvs/cem/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pypandoc/__init__.py\", line 69, in convert\r\n        outputfile=outputfile, filters=filters)\r\n      File \"/home/tbeck/.virtualenvs/cem/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pypandoc/__init__.py\", line 260, in _convert_input\r\n        _ensure_pandoc_path()\r\n      File \"/home/tbeck/.virtualenvs/cem/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pypandoc/__init__.py\", line 544, in _ensure_pandoc_path\r\n        raise OSError(\"No pandoc was found: either install pandoc and add it\\n\"\r\n    OSError: No pandoc was found: either install pandoc and add it\r\n    to your PATH or or call pypandoc.download_pandoc(...) or\r\n    install pypandoc wheels with included pandoc.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------\r\nCommand \"python setup.py egg_info\" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-mfnizcwa/pyspark/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change simply adds an additional exception handler for the OSError\r\nthat is raised. This allows pyspark to be installed client-side without requiring pandoc to be installed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested this by building a wheel package of pyspark with the change applied. Then, in a clean virtual environment with pypandoc installed but pandoc not available on the system, I installed pyspark from the wheel.\r\n\r\nHere is the output\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip freeze | grep

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`BasicWriteTaskStatsTracker.getFileSize()` to catch `FileNotFoundException`, log @ info and then return 0 as a file size.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that if a newly created file isn't visible due to the store not always having create consistency, the metric collection doesn't cause the failure. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test suite included, `BasicWriteTaskStatsTrackerSuite`. This not only checks the resilience to missing files, but verifies the existing logic as to how file statistics are gathered.\r\n\r\nNote that in the current implementation\r\n\r\n1. if you call `Tracker..getFinalStats()` more than once, the file size count will increase by size of the last file. This could be fixed by clearing the filename field inside `getFinalStats()` itself.\r\n\r\n2. If you pass in an empty or null string to `Tracker.newFile(path)` then IllegalArgumentException is raised, but only in `getFinalStats()`, rather than in `newFile`.  There's a test for this behaviour in the new suite, as it verifies that only FNFEs get swallowed.","created_at":"2017-08-17T20:05:53Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T17:57:18Z","closed_at":"2017-10-14T06:11:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ec2f47ad719b813c0ab69ec12031b58f4a3ff53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18979/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18979/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18979/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0e81a1c87011efdc010f1c9ba28dde003458667","head":{"label":"steveloughran:cloud/SPARK-21762-missing-files-in-metrics","ref":"cloud/SPARK-21762-missing-files-in-metrics","sha":"c0e81a1c87011efdc010f1c9ba28dde003458667","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `AND` or `OR` code generation to place condition and then expressions' generated code into separated methods if these size could be large. When the method is newly generated, variables for `isNull` and `value` are declared as an instance variable to pass these values (e.g. `isNull1409` and `value1409`) to the callers of the generated method.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolved two cases:\r\n\r\n* large code size of left expression\r\n* large code size of right expression\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #18892 :\r\nCurrently, Did a lot of special handling for non-deterministic projects in optimizer. but not good enough. this patch add a new special case for non-deterministic projects. the application logic is as follows, in my spark-shell, Simple creates a 22 column Orc data table.\r\n```\r\nval df = (0 until 50).map(i => (i % 2, i % 3, i % 4, i % 5, i % 6, i % 7, i % 8, i % 9, i % 10, i % 11,(i % 2).toString, (i % 3).toString, (i % 4).toString, (i % 5).toString, (i % 6).toString, (i % 7).toString, (i % 2).toDouble, (i % 3).toDouble, (i % 4).toDouble, (i % 5).toDouble, (i % 6).toDouble, (i %

statement:\r\n```\r\nval df_sql = spark.sql(\"SELECT i2,i3,i4,CASE WHEN i5 < 3 then i5 else ceil(rand(100)*100) end as i5 from tableorc\")\r\nprintln(\"executed Plan:\" + df_sql.queryExecution.executedPlan)\r\ndf_sql.show(500)\r\n```\r\n**Before modifiy, executed Plan:**\r\n```\r\n*Project [i2#100, i3#79, i4#80, CASE WHEN (i5#81 < 3) THEN cast(i5#81 as bigint) ELSE

userdata from orc table. there is such a change, Because the fields of projects is non-deterministic, contains nondeterministic function(rand function).  _PhysicalOperation_ excluded that the fields of projects is non-deterministic.\r\n\r\n**After modifiy, executed Plan:**\r\n```\r\n*Project [i2#87, i3#66, i4#67, CASE WHEN (i5#68 < 3) THEN cast(i5#68 as bigint) ELSE CEIL((rand(100) * 100.0)) END

In addition, HiveTableScans also scan more columns according to the execution plan:\r\n```\r\n*HashAggregate(keys=[k#403L], functions=[partial_sum(cast(id#402 as bigint))], output=[k#403L,

MetastoreRelation XXX_database, XXX_table\r\n```\r\nand it will affect the performance of task.\r\nSimilar query statements as follows:\r\n`select k,k,sum(id) from (select d004 as id, floor(rand() *

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith the check for structural integrity proposed in SPARK-21726, it is found that the optimization rule `PullupCorrelatedPredicates` can produce unresolved plans.\r\n\r\nFor a correlated IN query looks like:\r\n\r\n    SELECT t1.a FROM t1\r\n    WHERE\r\n    t1.a IN (SELECT t2.c\r\n            FROM t2\r\n            WHERE t1.b < t2.d);\r\n\r\nThe query plan might look like:\r\n\r\n    Project [a#0]\r\n    +- Filter a#0 IN (list#4 [b#1])\r\n       :  +- Project [c#2]\r\n       :     +- Filter (outer(b#1) < d#3)\r\n       :        +- LocalRelation <empty>, [c#2, d#3]\r\n       +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter `PullupCorrelatedPredicates`, it produces query plan like:\r\n\r\n    'Project [a#0]\r\n    +- 'Filter a#0 IN (list#4 [(b#1 < d#3)])\r\n       :  +- Project [c#2, d#3]\r\n       :     +- LocalRelation <empty>, [c#2, d#3]\r\n       +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1]\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the correlated predicate involves another attribute `d#3` in subquery, it has been pulled out and added into the `Project` on the top of the subquery.\r\n\r\nWhen `list` in `In` contains just one `ListQuery`, `In.checkInputDataTypes` checks if the size of `value` expressions matches the output size of subquery. In the above example, there is only `value` expression and the subquery output has two attributes `c#2, d#3`, so it fails the check and `In.resolved` returns `false`.\r\n\r\nWe should not let `In.checkInputDataTypes` wrongly report unresolved plans to fail the structural integrity check.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark RPC is built upon TCP tier and leverage netty framework. It would be better to have some comments in RPC module especially to explain the RPC message wire format since it is critical to understand what Message consists (header + payload). So Javadoc comments can be added into MessageEncoder class.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nOnly comments added. Existing unit tests are all passed.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-16T14:45:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T09:12:11Z","closed_at":"2017-08-17T09:12:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ecfd06ecc835d3e75f453b317e808228d587711","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a65bc214be8c05a3901193f9cc57d00fbbf506d5","head":{"label":"neoremind:add_comments","ref":"add_comments","sha":"a65bc214be8c05a3901193f9cc57d00fbbf506d5","user":{"login":"neoremind","id":590102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDEwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/590102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind","html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":99994581,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5OTk5NDU4MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"neoremind/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"neoremind","id":590102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDEwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/590102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind","html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTCP parameters like SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF can be set in SparkConf, and `org.apache.spark.network.server.TransportServe`r can use those parameters to build server by leveraging netty. But for TransportClientFactory, there is no such way to set those parameters from SparkConf. This could be inconsistent in server and client side when people set parameters in SparkConf. So this PR make RPC client to be enable to use those TCP parameters as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-16T14:34:42Z","updated_at":"2017-08-24T21:30:40Z","closed_at":"2017-08-24T21:30:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"225a4212bd453c8d63c1361f7f9eab0cf3eff7de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18964/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18964/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18964/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/14ba13b1fec4fbe20b130283ba0d6b2d5c58bb87","head":{"label":"neoremind:add_client_param","ref":"add_client_param","sha":"14ba13b1fec4fbe20b130283ba0d6b2d5c58bb87","user":{"login":"neoremind","id":590102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDEwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/590102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind","html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":99994581,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5OTk5NDU4MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"neoremind/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"neoremind","id":590102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDEwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/590102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind","html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith SPARK-10643, Spark supports download resources from remote in client deploy mode. But the implementation overrides variables which representing added resources (like `args.jars`, `args.pyFiles`) to local path, And yarn client leverage this local path to re-upload resources to distributed cache. This is unnecessary to break the semantics of putting resources in a shared FS. So here proposed to fix it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is manually verified with jars, pyFiles in local and remote storage, both in client and cluster mode.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-16T13:07:14Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T01:31:51Z","closed_at":"2017-08-25T17:00:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6a9536642aeb444633547f8e6d373277352a95b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cad4c7083bdd1411e7403f7537e59a27ef415fba","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-21714","ref":"SPARK-21714","sha":"cad4c7083bdd1411e7403f7537e59a27ef415fba","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-21739\r\n\r\nThis issue is caused by introducing TimeZoneAwareExpression.\r\nWhen the **Cast** expression converts something into TimestampType, it should be resolved with setting `timezoneId`. In general, it is resolved in LogicalPlan phase.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are still some places that use Cast expression statically to convert datatypes without setting `timezoneId`. In such cases,  `NoSuchElementException: None.get` will be thrown for TimestampType.\r\n\r\nThis PR is proposed to fix the issue. We have checked the whole project and found two such usages(i.e., in`TableReader` and `HiveTableScanExec`). \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have many optimization rules now in `Optimzer`. Right now we don't have any checks in the optimizer to check for the structural integrity of the plan (e.g. resolved). When debugging, it is difficult to identify which rules return invalid plans.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if in test mode, we can check whether a plan is still resolved after the execution of each rule, so we can catch rules that return invalid plans.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-16T05:02:08Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:34:51Z","closed_at":"2017-09-08T06:14:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5085d33de40c91ca1207a5790b11e18c7fdcc8ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ecdfb7db34d0d01e357bff0d32b62137ef0ae735","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-21726","ref":"SPARK-21726","sha":"ecdfb7db34d0d01e357bff0d32b62137ef0ae735","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor top-most limit, we will use a special operator to execute it: `CollectLimitExec`.\r\n\r\n`CollectLimitExec` will retrieve `n`(which is the limit) rows from each partition of the child plan output, see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.2.0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/SparkPlan.scala#L311. It's very likely that we don't exhaust the child plan output.\r\n\r\nThis is fine when whole-stage-codegen is off, as child plan will release the resource via task completion listener. However, when whole-stage codegen is on, the resource can only be released if all output is consumed.\r\n\r\nTo fix this memory leak, one simple approach is, when `CollectLimitExec` retrieve `n` rows from child plan output, child plan output should only have `n` rows, then the output is exhausted and resource is released. This can be done by wrapping child plan with `LocalLimit`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Semantics:\r\n- If the Hive table is bucketed, then INSERT node expect the child distribution to be based on the hash of the bucket columns. Else it would be empty. (Just to compare with Spark native bucketing : the required distribution is not enforced even if the table is bucketed or not... this saves the shuffle in comparison with hive).\r\n- Sort ordering for INSERT node over Hive bucketed table is determined as follows:\r\n\r\n| Table type   | Normal table | Bucketed table |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| non-partitioned insert  | Nil | sort columns |\r\n| static partition   | Nil | sort columns |\r\n| dynamic partitions   | partition columns | (partition columns + bucketId + sort columns) |\r\n\r\nJust to compare how sort ordering is expressed for Spark native bucketing:\r\n\r\n| Table type   | Normal table | Bucketed table |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  sort ordering | partition columns | (partition columns + bucketId + sort columns) |\r\n\r\nWhy is there a difference ? With hive, since there bucketed insertions would need a shuffle, sort ordering can be relaxed for both non-partitioned and static partition cases. Every RDD partition would get rows corresponding to a single bucket so those can be written to corresponding output file after sort. In case of dynamic partitions, the rows need to be routed to appropriate partition which makes it similar to Spark's constraints.\r\n\r\n- Only `Overwrite` mode is allowed for hive bucketed tables as any other mode will break the bucketing guarantees of the table. This is a difference wrt how Spark bucketing works.\r\n- With the PR, if there are no files created for empty buckets, the query will fail. Will support creation of empty files in coming iteration. This is a difference wrt how Spark bucketing works as it does NOT need files for empty buckets.\r\n\r\n### Summary of changes done:\r\n- `ClusteredDistribution` and `HashPartitioning` are modified to store the hashing function used.\r\n- `RunnableCommand`'s' can now express the required distribution and ordering. This is used by `ExecutedCommandExec` which run these commands\r\n  - The good thing about this is that I could remove the logic for enforcing sort ordering inside `FileFormatWriter` which felt out of place. Ideally, this kinda adding of physical nodes should be done within the planner which is what happens with this PR.\r\n- `InsertIntoHiveTable` enforces both distribution and sort ordering\r\n- `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` enforces sort ordering ONLY (and not the distribution)\r\n- Fixed a bug due to which any alter commands to bucketed table (eg. updating stats) would wipe out the bucketing spec from metastore. This made insertions to bucketed table non-idempotent operation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added new unit tests","created_at":"2017-08-16T04:43:06Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T00:10:34Z","closed_at":"2018-07-27T00:10:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e9e0e65a739b84e3fd826142990f8f9cbde0cf6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5cf3c91eb9918e570e42fdbba64be09aab60e3c","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:bucket_write","ref":"bucket_write","sha":"d5cf3c91eb9918e570e42fdbba64be09aab60e3c","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince [SPARK-21422](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21422), Apache Spark starts to depend on Apache ORC 1.4.0. This PR updates the existing Hive 1.2-based ORC data source by **removing Hive dependency** and **using a new Apache ORC 1.4.0 library** only.\r\n\r\nThe newly updated ORC format in this PR will enable the followings easily. Also, we can expect more later.\r\n\r\n1. Make the ORC data source independent from Hive module.\r\n  (We will be able to move new ORC data soruce into `sql/core` easily at the next step.)\r\n2. Supports column names with dot (SPARK-21791, #19004)\r\n3. Support for pushing down filters for DATE types (SPARK-21787, #18995)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the updated test suites.","created_at":"2017-08-16T01:44:24Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T07:04:19Z","closed_at":"2017-12-03T17:23:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d60bf9bf6fc844359402761daa14ed99b0f2c832","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed43eb7fb47a1c65875bbf97a8e108abfb115925","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-20682-3","ref":"SPARK-20682-3","sha":"ed43eb7fb47a1c65875bbf97a8e108abfb115925","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f76790557b063edc3080d5c792167e2f8b7060d1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change allows the user to specify the maximum no. of tasks running in a given job group. (Kindly see the jira comments section for more context on why this is implemented at a job group level rather than a stage level). This change is beneficial where the user wants to avoid having a DoS while trying to access an eternal service from multiple executors without having the need to repartition or coalesce existing RDDs.\r\n\r\nThis code change introduces a new user level configuration: `spark.job.[userJobGroup].maxConcurrentTasks` which is used to set the active no. of tasks executing at a given point in time.\r\n\r\nThe user can use the feature by setting the appropriate jobGroup and passing the conf:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconf.set(\"spark.job.group1.maxConcurrentTasks\", \"10\")\r\n...\r\nsc.setJobGroup(\"group1\", \"\", false)\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 10).map(x => x + 1).count\r\nsc.clearJobGroup\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### changes proposed in this fix \r\nThis change limits the no. of tasks (in turn also the no. of executors to be acquired) than can run simultaneously in a given job group and its subsequent job/s and stage/s if the appropriate job group and max concurrency configs are set.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan unit tests and multiple manual tests with various combinations of:\r\n- single/multiple/no job groups\r\n- executors with single/multi cores\r\n- dynamic allocation on/off\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-15T15:01:20Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T18:41:58Z","closed_at":"2017-09-07T18:41:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b61cbd287bb7680db3ccbf21803660375d6ecff3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b3830004d69bd5f109fd9846f59583c23a910c7","head":{"label":"dhruve:impr/SPARK-20589","ref":"impr/SPARK-20589","sha":"8b3830004d69bd5f109fd9846f59583c23a910c7","user":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54914940,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDkxNDk0MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dhruve/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve/spark","description":"Mirror

`SnappyOutputStream.close()` because the corresponding bug has been fixed in `snappy-java-1.1.2.6` that Spark currently uses.

to prevent needless Exceptions during routine use.\r\n\r\nAdd the `strict=True` kwarg to DataFrame.toPandas to allow for a non-strict interpretation of the schema of a dataframe. This is currently limited to allowing a nullable int column to being interpreted as a float column (because that is the only way Pandas supports nullable int columns and actually crashes without this).\r\n\r\nI consider this small change to be a massive quality of life improvement for DataFrames with lots of nullable int columns, which would otherwise need a litany of `df.withColumn(name, F.col(name).cast(DoubleType()))`, etc, just to view them easily or interact with them in-memory.\r\n\r\n**Possible Objections**\r\n* I foresee concerns with the name of the kwarg, of which I am open to suggestions.\r\n* I also foresee possible objections due to the potential for needless conversion of nullable int columns to floats when there are actually no null values. I would counter those objections by noting that it only occurs when strict=False, which is not the default, and can be avoided on a per-column basis by setting the `nullable` property of the schema to False. \r\n\r\n**Alternatives**\r\n* Rename the kwarg to be specific to the current change. i.e., `nullable_int_to_float` instead of `strict` or some other, similar name.\r\n* Fix Pandas to allow nullable int columns.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the codes to lazily init hive metastore client so that we can create SparkSession without talking to the hive metastore sever.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty helpful when you set a hive metastore server but it's down. You can still start the Spark shell to debug.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new unit

version fixes a few issues in the import order checker; it provides\r\nbetter error messages, and detects more improper ordering (thus the need\r\nto change a lot of files in this patch). The main fix is that it correctly\r\ncomplains about the order of packages vs. classes.\r\n\r\nAs part of the above, I moved some \"SparkSession\" import in ML examples\r\ninside the \"$example on$\" blocks; that didn't seem consistent across\r\ndifferent source files to start with, and avoids having to add more on/off blocks\r\naround specific imports.\r\n\r\nThe new scalastyle also seems to have a better header detector, so a few\r\nlicense headers had to be updated to match the expected indentation.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-15T00:10:56Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T21:04:49Z","closed_at":"2017-08-15T21:01:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"075428b3ae1bdd7d7b60f5ddf7d4cd1dbcd3bfc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18943/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18943/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18943/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b1e49fafe2e44a489f3c29c09ec7a7866120adda","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-21731","ref":"SPARK-21731","sha":"b1e49fafe2e44a489f3c29c09ec7a7866120adda","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

now the spark shuffle service has a cache for index files.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, we make native BLAS, if found, the default operations for ddot, daxpy and dscal.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, these operations are bound with F2J BLAS, but we found out that with proper setting as we proposed in SPARK-21305, native blas can outperform F2J blas in model training. Moreover, a uni-level test shows these three operations are running faster on native than JVM on different data scale from 10 to 100,000.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nwe tested the threes operation on different data scale and got: (we ran 3 times for each test and take the median value)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2673819/29262893-1ada0c5e-8109-11e7-820c-dbbcda2bbfa5.png)\r\n\r\nwe also tested this PR on SVM and got the result:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2673819/29262694-45fa7488-8108-11e7-857e-04474b4e4592.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2673819/29262705-4e6a87b6-8108-11e7-969c-72e0e5359618.png)\r\n\r\nWith this PR, these operations are more flexible to users that they can choose to run with F2J or native BLAS as they desire.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vincent

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in SPARK-21603 that whole-stage codegen suffers performance degradation, if the generated functions are too long to be optimized by JIT.\r\n\r\nWe basically produce a single function to incorporate generated codes from all physical operators in whole-stage. Thus, it is possibly to grow the size of generated function over a threshold that we can't have JIT optimization for it anymore.\r\n\r\nThis patch is trying to decouple the logic of consuming rows in physical operators to avoid a giant function processing rows.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-13T06:12:36Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:21Z","closed_at":"2018-01-25T11:53:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8006ffbf0970da6be61f56f4415074f31dac8d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11946e7a62928304560c0602d71b3064789086d6","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-21717","ref":"SPARK-21717","sha":"11946e7a62928304560c0602d71b3064789086d6","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror
