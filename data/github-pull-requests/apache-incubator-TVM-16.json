folks,\r\n\r\nThis PR adds helper functions to query any LLVM information about: targets, arches and it's features.\r\nIt can enhance TVM target handling with information from LLVM module, just like partially was done in: #15685\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\n * Introduces ```llvm_get_targets()```, ```llvm_get_cpu_archlist()```, ```llvm_get_cpu_features()```& ```llvm_cpu_has_features()```\r\n * Extends  current ```target_has_feature()``` to work with *any* target, now also having ```-mtriple```/```-mattr``` awareness\r\n * Exposes booth C/FFI & PY interfaces for all the functions mentioned above.\r\n * Adds new unit tests for the function logic and API consistency stress.\r\n * Ensures proper API compatibility with older LLVM, tested with LLVM={10,14,15,16,17}.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n####

to this commit, the CI compiled TVM with `USE_METAL=ON` on OSX, as defined in `conda/recipe/build.sh`, but did not validate the execution of any generated metal kernels.  As a result, breakage could occur without being caught by the CI, such as found following https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15103.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the execution of a single metal kernel as a

original implementation of Flip in PyTorch converter mistaken the type of attribute `axis` in the Flip operator as an integer. Thus, It only parses the first element of the `axis` and will give a wrong calculation result when the length of `axis` is more than one.  According to the PyTorch documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.flip.html), the type of `axis` is a list or tuple.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR corrected the incorrect

The codegen for tensorflow follow the same principle with relax codegen, thus generate the model define as well as test.\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15645, MSC enables the relay based features. The test in this PR shows developers how to combine relay.frontend.from_tensorflow and msc.core.codegen.relay_to_relax to \"create\" a frontend for tensorflow in

adding OpenCL wrapper, it is possible to build TVM with OpenCL support also on the host which doesn't have OpenCL libraries. But if you want to compile OpenCL module for a remote device on such host machine then you will see an error that OpenCL lib cannot be open.\r\n\r\nTo avoid such problem, we need to call OpenCL functions only in runtime. So function for initializing OpenCL workspace was removed from OpenCLModuleNode. And a new function `IsProgramCreated` was added. The last function is necessary to prepare vectors with OpenCL programs, associated with OpenCL devices. Previously it was done during OpenCLModule initialization. So, now we create such vectors only in runtime after getting list of available OpenCL devices.","created_at":"2023-09-14T06:52:58Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T01:32:22Z","closed_at":"2023-09-25T01:32:22Z","merged_at":"2023-09-25T01:32:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae89c1e56da5ac38e68575c0baec047c442b266d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d0a555a50785dbb940d19847c6b458af9b6dd581","head":{"label":"echuraev:echuraev/do_not_initialize_opencl_on_host","ref":"echuraev/do_not_initialize_opencl_on_host","sha":"d0a555a50785dbb940d19847c6b458af9b6dd581","user":{"login":"echuraev","id":5525113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev","html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317515420,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc1MTU0MjA=","name":"tvm","full_name":"echuraev/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"echuraev","id":5525113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev","html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev/tvm","description":"Open

This PR introduces ComposableKernel support in Unity. \r\n\r\n**Motivation**: The industry is asking for diversity of computing power. As an alternative to Nvidia GPUs, AMD backend is not as optimized as NV Backend in TVM. Thanks to BYOC and AMD Composable Kernel Project, we are able to exploit AMD backend performance with relatively low engineering effort.\r\n\r\n**TODOs**:\r\n- [ ] Finish GEMM op integration, including its profiler.\r\n- [ ] Add more ops including: attention, conv2d, softmax and etc.\r\n\r\n**Expected Timeline**:\r\nWe expected to finish TODO 1 within one

PR fixes a bug in the avg_pool2d implementation. The bug causes a KeyError when running the provided code snippet. The error message is as below:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n    ...\r\n    mod = from_fx(fx_model, input_info)\r\n  File \"/workplace/software/tvm/tvm/python/tvm/relax/frontend/torch/fx_translator.py\", line 1449, in from_fx\r\n    return TorchFXImporter().from_fx(\r\n  File \"/workplace/software/tvm/tvm/python/tvm/relax/frontend/torch/fx_translator.py\", line 1336, in from_fx\r\n    self.env[node] = self.convert_map[func_name](node)\r\n  File \"/workplace/software/tvm/tvm/python/tvm/relax/frontend/torch/fx_translator.py\", line 763, in _avg_pool2d\r\n    stride = node.args[2] if nargs > 2 else node.kwargs[\"stride\"]\r\nKeyError: 'stride'\r\n```\r\nAnd here is the code to reproduce this bug.\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch import fx\r\nfrom torch.nn import Module\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import relax\r\nfrom tvm.relax.frontend.torch import from_fx\r\n\r\ninput_data = torch.randn([1, 1, 3, 3], dtype=torch.float32)\r\npara_1 = (2, 1)\r\nclass avg_pool2d(Module):\r\n    def forward(self, input):\r\n        return torch.nn.functional.avg_pool2d(input, para_1,divisor_override=2,)\r\nmodel = avg_pool2d().float()\r\ninput_data = [input_data]\r\ninput_info = list(zip([list(inp.shape) for inp in input_data], [str(inp.dtype) for inp in input_data]))\r\nfx_model : torch.fx.GraphModule = fx.symbolic_trace(model)\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n    mod = from_fx(fx_model, input_info)\r\n```\r\nThe issue arises due to the lack of a check for the existence of the \"stride\" key in the code. To resolve this bug, I have modified the code to include a check for the existence of the \"stride\" key before accessing it. \r\n\r\nI have tested these changes by running the provided code snippet, and the KeyError is no longer thrown. The fix ensures that the code gracefully handles cases where the \"stride\" key is missing.\r\n\r\nPlease review and consider merging this PR.

PR introduces `ProcessSession`, a new session implementation based\r\non multi-processing.\r\n\r\n`ProcessSession` shares exactly the same communication protocol with\r\n`ThreadedSession`, but all workers except for worker 0 are launched in a\r\nseparate process than thread. Workers communicate with the controller\r\nvia pipe provided by the OS, rather than SPSC message queue between\r\nthreads.\r\n\r\nIn our implementation, Python's `subproces.popen` is used to create\r\nsubprocesses, and the Python executable, or more specifically,\r\n`sys.executable` calls into `tvm.exec.disco_worker` as the entrypoint.\r\nBesides the launching logic that is only executed once in the very\r\nbeginning, the rest of the implementation resides in a C++-only\r\nenvironment, including reads/writes to pipe file descriptors,\r\nserialization and deserialization of messages, worker interpretation of\r\neach message, etc.\r\n\r\nDetailed engineering elements included in this PR:\r\n- Refactors the MinRPC-based communication protocol out to be shared by\r\n  `ProcessSession` and `ThreadedSession` as `protocol.h`;\r\n- Refactors a controller-side worker thread into `DiscoWorkerThread`,\r\n  which is shared by both session implementation to launch worker-0;\r\n- Added two instructions `kDebugGetFromRemote` and `kDebugSetRegister`,\r\n  which are used to communicate with workers other than worker-0 in\r\n  debug mode;\r\n- Introduces multi-processing infra including: `tvm.exec.disco_worker`\r\n  serving as the entrypoint that launches workers, and\r\n  `tvm/runtime/disco/process_pool.py` that exposes APIs to launch worker\r\n  processes. `tvm.exec.disco_worker` calls into a global function\r\n  `runtime.disco.WorkerProcess` that executes the worker main loop in\r\n  pure C++;\r\n- Introduces `src/support/process_id.h` that provides cross-platform pid\r\n  and tid printing utilities;\r\n- Refactors Disco's NCCL integration that get rids of initialized-once\r\n  global NCCL context, and switches to broadcasting `ncclUniqueId` from\r\n  controller to all workers, and then create NCCL communicators in each\r\n  worker thread/process accordingly. This is a thread/process-agnostic\r\n  way of using NCCL.","created_at":"2023-09-12T06:19:51Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T11:43:45Z","closed_at":"2023-09-14T11:43:44Z","merged_at":"2023-09-14T11:43:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"40b9a926b9df375a6ca5ce51ea93e4d849b85517","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15727/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15727/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15727/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8aade57b98cb581af45d3c98d5b35579e5deb700","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-09-11/proc-session","ref":"feature/2023-09-11/proc-session","sha":"8aade57b98cb581af45d3c98d5b35579e5deb700","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

both dotprod and i8mm were available together on a target (e.g. `\"llvm --device=arm_cpu --mtriple=aarch64-linux-gnu -mattr=+v8.2a,+dotprod,+i8mm\"`), the native int8 conv2d implementation corresponding to the `+dotprod` attribute would be selected, but the compute definition of the conv2d operation would be constructed for the `+i8mm` attribute and its related interleaved schedule instead.  \r\nThe reason for this was a different order of conditional statements being used in 2 separate files:\r\n - `arm_cpu.py`: When selecting the conv2d implementation, the program first checked for `dotprod` support. If present, it chose the native schedule\r\n - `conv2d_gemm.py`: when constructing the compute definition, `i8mm` support is checked first, then `dotprod` \r\n \r\nTo fix this, I modified the int8 conv2d strategy to prioritize `i8mm` over `dotprod` when both are available too. I also added new test cases to cover this situation.  \r\n\r\ncc @ekalda @lhutton1 @leandron @neildhickey

padding the input data, the int8 conv2d interleaved schedule tries to split the `data_im2col` cols axis by a factor of 16 in order to then vectorize over those splits. However, the size of the axis is `n_size = KH x KW x IC` and the `Legalize` pass only pads the number of input channels up to a multiple of 8. Therefore, `n_size` is only guaranteed to be a multiple of 8, not 16.   \r\n\r\nI modified the schedule to check whether a split factor of 16 is appropriate, otherwise use 8 instead, in order to ensure vectorization is performed in all cases.\r\n\r\ncc @ekalda @lhutton1 @leandron @neildhickey

into some steps:\r\n**M1.1 Add translate && codegen for torch**\r\nM1.2 Add translate && codegen for tensorflow\r\nM1.3 Add codegen for tensorrt\r\nM1.4 Add RuntimeManager and test with relax\r\nM1.5 Add RuntimeManager and test with torch\r\nM1.6 Add RuntimeManager and test with tensorflow\r\nM1.7 Add RuntimeManager and test with tensorrt\r\n\r\nTorch module will be translate to MSCGraph via relax or relay, both method will be tested. The codegen for torch follow the same principle with relax codegen, thus generate the model define as well as test. \r\nThis PR is pre-request for RuntimeManager of torch. The MSCGraph can not only built from torch, but also build to torch. This is essential for using the training ability of torch to optimize the model.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy \r\ncc @junrushao

to this commit, the `VarVisitor` used in the implementation of `all_vars` and `free_vars` only collected variable usage sites where the variable was a `const VarNode*`, and ignored usage sites of a `const DataflowVarNode*`.  When analyzing an entire function, these variables were found in the `const VisitVarBinding*`, and could pass the existing tests.  However, when analyzing a single expression, these variables would be erroneously excluded.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a `VisitExpr_(const DataflowVarNode*)` implementation in `VarVisitor`, to collect variable usage regardless of the type of variable.","created_at":"2023-09-07T21:02:00Z","updated_at":"2023-09-08T16:01:29Z","closed_at":"2023-09-08T04:22:11Z","merged_at":"2023-09-08T04:22:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"7df7b7b1b0f0d6ffaeac5e0981355d3ea9bd478f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f842e52be7a64e7426f54803062b4c62a495cb9a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_collect_dataflow_vars_in_all_vars","ref":"unity_collect_dataflow_vars_in_all_vars","sha":"f842e52be7a64e7426f54803062b4c62a495cb9a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

For example, matching against `R.add(lhs,rhs)` where `lhs` and `rhs` have the same non-broadcasted shape.  Because these constraints operate between patterns that do not necessarily share a consumer/producer relationship, they could not previously be expressed using the existing `PairCons` functionality,

part of #15319, this PR implements liveness analysis, which is implemented using a dataflow analysis framework similar to that described by Adrian Sampson in these lecture notes: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/lesson/4/. See also Chapter 5 of [Static Program Analysis](https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/spa.pdf) by Møller and Schwartzbach.\r\n\r\nThis required, for good or ill, introducing quite a bit of infrastructure. Here is a summary:\r\n* A control flow graph representation, representing a function in terms of bindings (which maps closely to the notion of bindings within Relax's AST, but we also need to represent the `body` field of `SeqExpr`s and we have to consider the condition, true branch, false branch, and the merge point at the end of an `If` node, so the mapping is not one-to-one).\r\n* An implementation of the general dataflow framework from the sources listed.\r\n* An implementation of liveness analysis using Sampson's approach (which ended up being very compact thanks to the dataflow framework). The liveness analysis results are given in terms of a set of live variables per node in the control flow graph. A helper function is included for mapping between the AST and the CFG.\r\n\r\nI highly encourage review, since I am a bit nervous about introducing new infrastructure; I am especially concerned about having clear naming (I am worried about having a name so close to the dataflow pattern matching). I felt it was unavoidable in this case, because there does not seem to be any other way for us to annotate program locations with liveness information. However, I am very glad to have implemented the general dataflow framework, since it could also be used for alias analysis and likely further analyses down the line.","created_at":"2023-09-06T21:44:18Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:18Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"341eafb8dabb9d2067dff676d79e804e270318f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7679535a93a6e00cfa3087da04f611812278ba61","head":{"label":"slyubomirsky:liveness-analysis","ref":"liveness-analysis","sha":"7679535a93a6e00cfa3087da04f611812278ba61","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149190623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDkxOTA2MjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"slyubomirsky/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, writing a subclass of `relax::ExprVisitor` or `relax::ExprMutator` required separate overrides for visiting a `relax::DataflowVar` and a `relax::Var`.  In the majority of cases, these two types should be treated identically, and failure to handle a `DataflowVar` equivalently would be a bug.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `relax::ExprVisitor` and `relax::ExprMutator` base classes to visit `DataflowVar` by delegate to the visitor of `relax::Var`.  As a result, any derived class that overrides the `relax::Var` visitor will also update the behavior for `relax::DataflowVar`.  A pass that requires different behavior for `relax::Var` and `relax::DataflowVar` can still explicitly override both methods in order to provide different behavior.","created_at":"2023-09-06T21:19:09Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T20:15:05Z","closed_at":"2023-09-26T20:15:02Z","merged_at":"2023-09-26T20:15:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6ea16b98e72e30e6a73a831e14ad0e0a42a2fd04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15688/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15688/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15688/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/11bf9643b0ebfe67ae51c889f0e50b33ba76add3","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_default_dataflow_var_delegation","ref":"unity_default_dataflow_var_delegation","sha":"11bf9643b0ebfe67ae51c889f0e50b33ba76add3","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR enhances the fallback dlight GPU rule so that it can support more non-trivial spatial workloads.\r\n\r\nParticularly, to this end, this PR makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n* for function normalization: when a block of a TIR PrimFunc cannot be applied by \"TransformLayout\", it will now give up layout transformation instead of throwing the error in TransformLayout.\r\n* for the fallback rule, if the return value of the normalization is None, it will directly return, instead of proceeding the inline attempt.\r\n* for the fallback rule, when iterating the blocks in the PrimFunc, if the loops of a block are already bound to GPU threads, the block will be skipped so the loops will not be processed again.","created_at":"2023-09-06T17:56:58Z","updated_at":"2023-09-06T20:30:16Z","closed_at":"2023-09-06T20:30:15Z","merged_at":"2023-09-06T20:30:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1725ac01d0cb9b2ef197fd9ab9b7feb5de2f440","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/846709b55817474b5c1ec7943f497f1c283973c0","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:unity-dev/2023-09-06-dlight-fallback","ref":"unity-dev/2023-09-06-dlight-fallback","sha":"846709b55817474b5c1ec7943f497f1c283973c0","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

commit adds 2 new Relax ops:\r\n1. \"relax.op.smooth\" (R.smooth): Multiply elements from a tensor by a scale (if it operates like \"multiply\") or pass input as is (if it operates like \"identity\").\r\n2. \"relax.annotate.absmax\" (R.absmax): Helper op, that does the following transform: abs()->max()->squeeze() for the input tensor.\r\n\r\nBoth of them are used in SmoothQuant TVM passes used in MLC-llm.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not include unit tests for these new ops, since they are single-purpose ops and not widely used. This way we can save time on regression testing.","created_at":"2023-09-06T16:01:24Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T06:00:07Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T06:00:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"00f1e16727d4b76663ae92c025e960b1669728d3","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fc25d508d64341906a62ac2175407e503354d177","head":{"label":"ibsidorenko:smoothquant-new-ops","ref":"smoothquant-new-ops","sha":"fc25d508d64341906a62ac2175407e503354d177","user":{"login":"ibsidorenko","id":98739392,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeKkwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98739392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":485713421,"node_id":"R_kgDOHPNmDQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"ibsidorenko/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibsidorenko","id":98739392,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeKkwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98739392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko/tvm","description":"Open

folks,\r\n\r\nThis PR leverage LLVM itself for CPU features lookup, replacing hard-coded lists.\r\nIn order to keep maintainability with X86 families & features we can rely on LLVM.\r\n\r\n---\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n* Introduce a single ```target_has_feature(XXX)``` replacing all ```target_has_XXX()```\r\n* PY+FFI: expose new ```llvm_x86_get_archlist```, ```llvm_x86_get_features``` & ```llvm_x86_has_feature```\r\n* PY:  expose new ```target_has_feature``` wrapper to ```_ffi.llvm_x86_has_feature```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is a test unit for a comprehensive check with the old behaviour.\r\nFor better reliability, this way of feature checking can be implemented for other arches.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n~Cristian.\r\n\r\nCc: @elvin-n , @vvchernov ,

PR adds an intrinsic to create barriers that can be used with existing barrier intrinsics for synchronization.  The prior method of barrier allocation was to use `alloc_buffer` e.g. as follows `barrier = T.alloc_buffer([1], \"uint64\", scope=\"shared\")` and then pass the pointer and offset to that barrier allocation for use in the barrier intrinsics.  This was a functional interface, but also caused problems with alignment of other non-barrier shared memory allocations.  See removed workarounds marked with `TODO` in the tests in this PR.  At the expense of the additional `create_barriers` intrinsic we get a simplified interface using barrier ID rather than pointer / offset passed to the barrier intrinsics and more low-level codegen control which is used in this PR to solve the alignment
