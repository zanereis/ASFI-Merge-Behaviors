write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen a chart was accessed from a dashboard, the dashboard configuration, including color palette and temporal filter, was carried over to the Chart Builder. If a temporal filter was carried over and the chart was subsequently overwritten, the temporal filter was not functioning correctly with the dashboard temporal filter.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5705598/ae8bab1c-c5f9-4d0f-8f6f-a246ec1c02b9)\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the Bug:**\r\n1. Create a chart and add it to a dashboard.\r\n2. Add a time range filter to the dashboard and apply a value.\r\n3. Click on the chart title to access it in the Chart Builder menu.\r\n4. Add a new filter to the chart.\r\n5. Overwrite the chart and return to the dashboard.\r\n6. Apply any time range filter.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis commit fixes the invalid reducer key name (localStorageUsage).\r\n\r\nFYI: it's not feature breaking (just warning from redux toolkit dev inspector). The warning from the header menu in SQL Lab which uses the separate SPA redux store and getInitialState() method passed the SQLLab reducer value for localStorageUsageInKilobytes which makes the noise.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![Screenshot 2023-08-31 at 12 10 38 PM](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/6b4a649c-22bc-4172-a3a3-3ef2dcf9c442)\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nPart 4-9 of SQLLab SPA migration work: [detail link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1opyNuaw-CEAD9tG6fx_zqNcZwe3_soQgsnSJTP4mQkk/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n- Change the url from /superset/sqllab to /sqllab\r\n- Update frontend routes\r\n- Update unit tests and cypress e2e tests\r\n- Update redirectSQLLab logic\r\n\r\nFor the redirect logic, it will replace the SupersetClient.post redirection by react-router redirection with the location state for the post payload data. This means the redundant form_data serialize/deserialize logic has been discarded (which is also another performance gain). \r\n\r\n~~FYI: This commit does *not* include the delete work (i.e. old entrypoint related files, redirect legacy endpoint to new endpoint). This work will be handled in the next PR to minimize the regression rollback.~~ \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the SQL Lab page works as before but in the context of SPA (does not reload the page when navigating)\r\n2. Make sure that /superset/sqllab redirects to /sqllab including additional query parameters\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-31T18:56:09Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T17:17:19Z","closed_at":"2023-10-04T19:21:41Z","merged_at":"2023-10-04T19:21:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ab1e7eae45b789c08c0b99612b4a410bbb986b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kgabryje","id":15073128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDczMTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15073128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje","html_url":"https://github.com/kgabryje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jinghua-qa","id":81597121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTk3MTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81597121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa","html_url":"https://github.com/jinghua-qa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":

Create a chart using `video_games_sales` dataset from sample data\r\n2. Use column `year` which has `python_date_format` set to `%Y`\r\n3. Verify that the chart works correctly\r\n4. Verify that in the \"Results\" table the original value of `year` column is a timestamp and formatted value is in a human readable datetime format\r\n5. Verify that adding a time range filter on column `year` works correctly\r\n6. Add the chart to a dashboard and add a VALUE native filter\r\n7. Select a few values (years), apply the filter and verify that the chart was correctly filtered\r\n8. Repeat those steps using a different dataset and a dttm column which doesn't have `python_date_format` set \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

to #19605, it fails the conversion to a moment object. Since the Flask‚Äôs JSON serialization of decimals casts it to a string is actually correct as it preserves precision, so the frontend should expect strings.\r\nThis commit adds the extra parse logic in sqllab query sync to handle the floating value in the string format.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR moves `TypedDict`s from `typing_extensions` to `typing` as they are built-in [since Python 3.8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0589/).\r\n\r\n> The typing_extensions module serves two related purposes:\r\n> \r\n> Enable use of new type system features on older Python versions. For example, typing.TypeGuard is new in Python 3.10, but typing_extensions allows users on previous Python versions to use it too.\r\n> Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and added to the typing module.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I\r\n- fixed some spelling\r\n- used walrus := if I found the opportunity and simplified code\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nunit + integration tests run successfully as code has been simplified. No functionality has been changed.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25053 extended the `ab_user.email` column (which has a uniqueness key constraint associated with it) from 64 to 320 characters.

problematic.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

SUMMARY\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25111\r\n\r\nWhen a table schema is already populated and synced with remote id, the autocomplete can trigger 'MERGE_TABLE' with the already referenced table. This action can overwrite the remote id by the auto-gen id.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this bug by skipping the overwrite the remote id. This commit also fixes the unexpected narrow gap between table control buttons due to the icon migration from font-awesome to antd icons \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a problem when importing CSV data that contains international timestamps (days come before months). We use Pandas [read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) to handle this operation and this PR exposes the `dayfirst` configuration to address the issue.\r\n\r\n###

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFixing the bug whenever a user is trying to do an overwrite action from permalink state. The main issue is when using a permalink the explore `SaveModal` doesn't properly pass the slice_id to allow the reload of the update chart. To fix this i've added logic to make sure the slice_id is always present before redirecting.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/27827808/9c3af440-bede-482e-a8cc-5b3cf0a5d1b4\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated PR: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23627\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe save button was flickering from a non-split save button to a split save button due to a variable database.allows_virtual_table_explore being undefined after component mounts. Added logic to prevent this flickering behavior by blocking the save button from rendering while allows_virtual_table_explore is undefined. If allows_virtual_table_explore === false, then the non-split save button will still render.\r\n\r\nAdjusted testsuite to test for this behavior.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore: \r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/6eaf1679a6ac480daf675d367e561488\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/a378b25defda424689f9aa6a16ff3aed?sid=37b2a345-3d49-4ff2-9e8a-078ad6f92282\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22208, the dashboard import commands would not replace charts when the overwrite flag was true, charts would be merged into one dashboard. This change fixes the command in the exact same way as that PR.\r\n\r\nFixes #22127\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard with a chart.\r\n2. Export the dashboard for import later.\r\n3. Modify the dashboard to remove the first chart and add a new one.\r\n4. Import the saved dashboard earlier (via UI OR /api/v1/dashboard/import)\r\n5. Notice both charts are in the dashboard\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nWhen ResultSet renders a large size of column record (i.e. preview of FCC 2018 Survey), rendering cost of VirtualizedTable is heavy. To avoid the lag of the typing editor, we should avoid the ResultSet rendering while typing.\r\nThis commit fixes the inefficient userSelector in ResultSet which triggers the re-rendering of FilterableTable anytime redux action triggered.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nAfter (no lag while typing):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/3e346d56-aa7c-4852-9a6a-db0f8a145e9b\r\n\r\nBefore (lagging after render the table

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23582 fixed this exact same issue, but only for the dashboard import command.  I didn't realize at the time this also needed to be fixed for the assets import command (used by` /api/v1/assets/import`).  It turns out there's a good amount of duplicated code between the different import commands, so the same fix has to be copied here as well.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nRecently, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24789 changed the way that datasource access is granted, specifically in the case that a user should have access to a datasource because they have access to a dashboard.   Before https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24789, datasource access was only granted as a result of dashboard access when `DASHBOARD_RBAC` was enabled, or when a guest user viewed an embedded dashboard while `EMBEDDED_SUPERSET` was enabled.\r\n\r\nThe PR made this process more secure, but only enabled it for `DASHBOARD_RBAC`, not embedded.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up that enables this for embedded.  Without this PR, charts on embedded dashboards cannot load because guest users have no way to get access to the datasources.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25006\r\n\r\ncc @john-bodley \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nGIFs below are of a simple host app which renders an embedded superset dashboard\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![embedded_perms_before](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/47196419/0048e51b-e35e-48e8-a97f-29232c4da322)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![embedded_perms_after](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/47196419/baf7b8f4-d52e-4f86-ba68-1aa48553add8)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe've recently run into an issue with Celery worker processes becoming idle that's likely caused by an open regression in Celery 5 (see https://github.com/celery/celery/discussions/7276 for more details). While downgrading to Celery 4 isn't an option, one way of ensuring Alerts & Reports are running is monitoring the scheduling tasks. This PR adds a StatsD metric to `reports.scheduler`, and while at it, also does the same for `reports.execute` and `reports.prune_log`. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the initialization of cross filters scope. The algorithm was not considering dashboards that were created before `DASHBOARD_CROSS_FILTERS` was enabled. `metadata.global_chart_configuration.scope` might not exist and that was generating an

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe `perm` and `schema_perm` attributes for dataset model is out of sync due to unreliably using sqlalchemy `get_history` method where the history state depends on whether the session has flushed or not.\r\nPreviously we have logic in `before_update` and `after_update` and permission sync logic in `after_update` will not be deterministic due to session flush.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves permission sync logic into `before_update` and directly using connection.execute to check current db state instead of relying on session state to make sure we can detect actual db/table/schema changes to trigger permission update.\r\n\r\nIt also clean up shadow_dataset_write logic out as we no longer support it but the database attribute is still not lazily loaded when dataset.database attribute is accessed. Thus I leave the `load_database` method there still.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

been running into the infamous SQLAlchemy QueuePool issue which typically occurs when connections aren't being closed. Thankfully Flask-SQLAlchemy normally handles this for us, per [here](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-sqlalchemy/blob/e5bf821072de0d55ff92891432004322864a7265/src/flask_sqlalchemy/__init__.py#L872-L886), when the app context is torn down.\r\n\r\nGrokking the code it seems like there are instances (for right or wrong) where we create our own sessions which aren't then explicitly closed. This PR ensures that either i) these sessions are now closed, or ii) the Flask-SQLAlchemy session is used.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nPyHive added [support for Python 3.11](https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive/pull/454) and [SQLAlchemy 2.0](https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive/pull/457) recently. \r\n\r\npure-sasl library is installed in all PY versions since it is a dependency of thrift-sasl, a dependency of PyHive.\r\n\r\nPY < 3.11: sasl library will be installed and used as PyHive's code gives it first preference. \r\nPY >= 3.11 Only pure-sasl library will be installed and used.\r\n\r\n`test-postgres-hive` CI test in this repo will always pure-sasl because PY 11 test cases fail if sasl is installed.\r\n\r\nNote: `'pyhive[hive]'` extras uses [sasl](https://pypi.org/project/sasl/) that doesn't support Python 3.11, See https://github.com/cloudera/python-sasl/issues/30. Hence PyHive also supports [pure-sasl](https://pypi.org/project/pure-sasl/) via additional extras `'pyhive[hive_pure_sasl]'` which support Python 3.11 along with all previous Python versions.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nPY 3.11: https://github.com/apache/superset/actions/runs/5945658123/job/16125068727?pr=25030\r\nPY

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24129 bumped Prophet to 1.1.4 but there's a [nasty bug](https://github.com/facebook/prophet/issues/2354) affecting all versions following 1.1.1. This PR downgrades Prophet to 1.1.1 and pins the version in `setup.py`. We can relax the version constraint once that bug is fixed.\r\n\r\nThis PR also reverts the [holidays bump](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24647) given that version 0.28 is incompatible with `prophet` 1.1.1 even with a declared dependency of `holidays>=0.14.2`. I tried using version 0.28 but it broke CI.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR removes a function in `superset_config.py` and replaces it by built-in `os.getenv()`. Instead of raising an exception when the env variable is missing, they now have a default value. Their default values are the same as in `.env` file (same values as in [.env-non-dev](https://github.com/sebastianliebscher/superset/blob/master/docker/.env-non-dev))\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nChanges in `superset_config.py` only affect docker deployments, so in order to test this PR run `docker-compose up` and check variables values.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24996, @jfrag1 identified an issue with https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24789 as there were no guarantees that form-data provided was backed by a trusted source. \r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24996#issuecomment-1679813683, I looked into seeing whether the access request could be more context aware, though regrettably the caller is of type `QueryContext` which is dashboard agnostic. The proposed fix, per @nytai's [suggestion](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24996#issuecomment-1679896140), was to add an additional check to verify that the dashboard chart (per the `dashboardId` and `slice_id` form-data fields) is associated with the datasource in question.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR places the examples database on it's own database, previously the examples database tables were being created on Superset's metadata database by default.\r\nSetting the examples database on it's own database will stop giving users access to Superset's metadata database through SQLLab avoiding several possible attack vectors.\r\n\r\nBy default without using docker-compose, the examples database will be set on it's own SQLite db. Using docker-compose the postgres container will create a specific user for the examples db and the db itself.\r\nRemoved the default that set's the `SQLALCHEMY_EXAMPLES_URI` to be equal to `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` when not set.\r\n\r\n### Before:\r\n<img width=\"397\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 17 58 13\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4025227/0a3b3242-60f4-4868-a2b1-db3236e414cf\">\r\n\r\n### After:\r\n<img width=\"387\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 15 27 39\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4025227/92125280-25ee-4d4b-b8c5-18a267349e40\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nUnlike other db engines, the mssql one does not include a check to see if there is even a need to return a result set before trying to fetch the data, that's why we are failing on a non select queries with the Statement not executed or executed statement has no resultset error.\r\nIn order to see if there is any result to try and fetch, we should check if the cursor description is not None.\r\n\r\nJust for a reference we can see that other db engines like oracle or postgres do have that check before trying to fetch:\r\nOracle\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/85a7d5cb3ebe833cfc2980f0846f15bb7ce1dd01/superset/db_engine_specs/postgres.py#L176C1-L179\r\n\r\nPostgres\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/85a7d5cb3ebe833cfc2980f0846f15bb7ce1dd01/superset/db_engine_specs/postgres.py#L176C1-L179\r\n\r\nThe result is failure in running a DML queries due to **'mssql error: Statement not executed or executed statement has no resultset'**\r\n\r\nSo the fix is simply to add that check before calling the inherited fetch_data method.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis reverts https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24789 due to a security issue that could allow any user to retrieve data from any datasource.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the dashboard id being checked here for the dashboard context comes from the request payload from the client, not a trusted backend source.  Therefore a user can copy a valid request for a datasource they shouldn't have access to and simply change the dashboard id in the form data to a dashboard they have access to, bypassing this security check.\r\n\r\nI can't think of a secure way to assert the presence of a dashboard context on the backend when retrieving chart data; the old approach may be the best we can do\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nI initially was looking into this due to this issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/19849, however I found the issue was mostly fixed on master.  Access to charts and datasets of the dashboard is revoked when the role is revoked.  However, favorited dashboards that the user shouldn't have access to otherwise still show up on the dashboard listview, which I think is undesired since trying to click on that dashboard then results in an error.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it so that favorite status is not taken into consideration by the list dashboards endpoint.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/19849\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe PR #24471, which meant to harmonize column naming for Oracle-like databases like Snowflake, caused issues for deployments that were relying on the current behavior of normalizing column names for physical datasets. This PR changes adds a field `normalize_columns` to the Dataset/SQLA Table models. This defaults to `False` for new datasets, but for old datsets, this is set to `True` via a db migration to ensure we don't break existing datasets.\r\n\r\nFor existing datasets, \"Normalize columns\" is checked:\r\n<img width=\"889\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/02dab6d0-81d9-4639-adc2-60115f270a1e\">\r\nWhen checked, the behavior is consistent with how it was previously, i.e. physical datasets on Snowflake have normalized column names:\r\n<img width=\"885\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/f54d5e83-ae26-45b7-9d3e-6a793ff33f79\">\r\n\r\nFor new datasets, the checkbox is unchecked:\r\n<img width=\"886\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/80a66d3e-a19b-4d45-a368-1767b3602754\">\r\nIn this case, a physical dataset on Snowflake will denormalize the columns, usually showing them as UPPERCASE:\r\n<img width=\"887\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/da4328be-69f8-4d75-898f-d827c2e193f6\">\r\n\r\nThis means, that for new datasets, column names are no longer normalized, unless the flag is checked.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes
