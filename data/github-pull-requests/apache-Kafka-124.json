currently store keystore file modification time when loading keystores in a `SecurityStore` instance. When dynamically updating keystores without filename change, we compare the time at the last load against the current file modification time. But we load keystore for validation of dynamic configs and as a result, we dont recreate SSLContext when performing actual reconfiguration after the validation. We always create a new `SecurityStore` instance for reconfiguration of the store, so we only need to store file modification time when we construct the instance.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

to close file handlers before renaming files / directories and open them back if required\r\n\r\nFollowing are the file renaming scenarios:\r\n- Files are renamed to .deleted so they can be deleted\r\n- .cleaned files are renamed to .swap as part of Log.replaceSegments flow\r\n- .swap files are renamed to original files as part of Log.replaceSegments flow\r\n\r\nFollowing are the folder renaming scenarios:\r\n- When a topic is marked for deletion, folder is renamed\r\n- As part of replacing current logs with future logs in LogManager\r\n\r\nIn above scenarios, if file handles are not closed, we get file access violation exception\r\n\r\nIdea is to close the logs and file segments before doing a rename and open them back up if required.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Keep each level's sensor creation and metrics registration / de-registration logic inside the XXMetrics class itself. Making StreamsMetricsImpl a util function centric plus enwrapping the Metrics registry which is going to be shared for all the XXXMetrics (KAFKA-6819)\r\n\r\n1.a Each XXMetrics object will keep track of all the sensors it has ever created, and a `clear` function which must be called when the corresponding object (a thread, a task, etc) is closed.\r\n\r\n1.b From anywhere inside the code base, as long as the class can access the StreamsMetricsImpl class it can use the util functions to get the sensor it wants to record from the `metrics` registry following the protocol. Only when it cannot access StreamsMetricsImpl the sensor need to be pre-accessed and passed through the constructor.\r\n\r\n1.c De-couple the original thread-level sensors as `StreamThreadMetrics `, extracted from the StreamsMetricsImpl class -- hence the latter can become a pure util functions provider and not keep track of any sensors.\r\n\r\n2. Make metric / group / tag names constant strings, residing either in each level's metrics class if they belong to specific sensors, and in StreamsMetricsImpl if they are util strings like suffix / prefix.\r\n\r\n3. Change public StreamsMetrics interface to be more intuitive for users (KAFKA-6820). And make all internal usages to leverage on the provided util functions of StreamsMetricsImpl as well.\r\n\r\n4. Remove default parent-sensors from everywhere.\r\n\r\n5. TEST: use `getMetricByName` and `getMetricByNameAndTags` from the utils class across all unit test classes.\r\n\r\n6. MINOR: because of 1), `MockStreamsMetrics` is not needed any more and can be replaced with StreamsMetricsImpl now since the latter is now a stateless util layer (tech debt KAFKA-5676).\r\n\r\nNOTE one thing's missing here is the compatibility path with old metrics, which will be done in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-25T07:48:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T23:57:59Z","closed_at":"2019-10-15T18:43:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"193a43a146e49d3d7d2cd1e9c8bdb12386bd381a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6498/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6498/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6498/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1119311fb2154359d6bd8a9b1030a5d90cb4a576","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K6820-refactor-thread-metrics","ref":"K6820-refactor-thread-metrics","sha":"1119311fb2154359d6bd8a9b1030a5d90cb4a576","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

We run into the exceptions shown below. We actually never ran into a scenario where the buffer exceeded the size of the application buffer size or packet buffer size. But, we see overflow/underflow where they exactly match the size. We noticed these exceptions with both 2.1.0 and 2.1.1. \r\n\r\nIn our application we have consumers/producers that are Java and Go based.\r\n\r\nWhile I am not aware of what the original reasoning was to actually generate an exception due to buffer over/underflow. As per SSLEngine documentation, one is supposed to resize respective buffers and retry the operation appropriately. \r\n\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLEngine.html\r\n\r\nWe have both Go (librdkafka) and Java (confluent) clients and these are the tracebacks we see on the brokers, very consistently.

PR fixes KAFKA-7989 and KAFKA-8123: testResponseThrottleTimeWhenBothProduceAndRequestQuotasViolated and testResponseThrottleTimeWhenBothFetchAndRequestQuotasViolated.\r\n\r\nThe failure was due to throttle-time metric for produce/consume was not updated. \r\n\r\nThe root cause of the failure is that test's `setUp()` sets quota configs for various producers/consumers, which is done through admin client, but it waited for only default and unthrottled client quotas to be updated; it did not wait for quota of smallQuotaProducerClientId and smallQuotaConsumerClientId to be updated. The failed tests are those that verify throttle metrics of smallQuotaProducerClientId and smallQuotaConsumerClientId clients. One important details is that default request quota and request quota of smallQuotaConsumer/ProducerClientId are the same == 0.01. The test failure happens if the test runs before produce/consume quota gets updated (the default request quota is already small). In this case, the request gets throttled due to violating request quota, but not produce/consume quota, while the test expects that both types of quotas are violated. The fix is for the test to wait for all quotas to be updated in `setUp` before running tests.\r\n\r\nI was not able to reproduce the test failure locally. However, I was able to \"reproduce\" this by adding a while loop in the beginning of ClientQuotaManager#updateQuota(). \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

suggest that reducing the allocation and copying of ByteBuffer when logValidator do validation when magic value to use is above 1 and no format conversion or value overwriting is required for compressed messages.And improved code is as follows.\r\n1. Adding a class **SimplifiedDefaultRecord** implement class Record which define  various attributes of a message. \r\n2. Adding Function **simplifiedreadFrom**() at class **DefaultRecord** .This function will not read data from DataInput to  ByteBuffer which need newly creating .**This will reduce the allocation and copying of ByteBuffer** when logValidator do validation .This will reduces GC frequency. We offer a simple read function to read data from **DataInput** whithout create ByteBuffer.Of course this opertion can not avoid deconmpression to data.\r\n3. Adding Function **simplifiedIterator**() and **simplifiedCompressedIterator**() at class **DefaultRecordBatch**.This two functions will return iterator of instance belongs to class **SimplifiedDefaultRecord**.\r\n4. Modify code of function **validateMessagesAndAssignOffsetsCompressed**() at class  LogValidator.\r\n\r\n    **After modifing code wich  reducing the allocation and copying of ByteBuffer**, the test performance is greatly improved, and the CPU's stable usage is below 60%. The following is a comparison of different code test performance under the same conditions.\r\n**Result of performance testing**\r\nMain config of Kafka: Single

This chaining behavior is lacking in KafkaProducer#flush() which breaks the API contract that all the previous futures will be in done state when the flush is complete.","created_at":"2019-03-19T00:10:46Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T17:38:46Z","closed_at":"2019-04-01T17:38:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4eb6cde11225f3e0782a33e9cdb7876bc13e941","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6469/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6469/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6469/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/304fc25454628102af27f444a6adae0a74ed9532","head":{"label":"viswamy:fix-flush-behavior","ref":"fix-flush-behavior","sha":"304fc25454628102af27f444a6adae0a74ed9532","user":{"login":"viswamy","id":7234532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMzQ1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7234532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/viswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176387582,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzODc1ODI=","name":"kafka","full_name":"viswamy/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viswamy","id":7234532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMzQ1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7234532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/viswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viswamy/kafka","description":"Mirror

new constructor is similar to an existing constructor, with a flag enableAutoResolution to enable/disable automatic resolution of indirect variable. The originals configurations will contain both the config provider configs as well as configuration properties. The constructor will first instantiate the ConfigProviders using the config provider configs, then it will find all variables in the values of the originals configurations, attempt to resolve the variables using the named ConfigProviders, and then do the normal parsing and validation of the configurations. If ConfigProvider is not provided in the originals, the constructor will skip the variable substitution step and will simply validate and parse the supplied configuration. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer

saw one failure in testPartitionReassignmentDuringDeleteTopic unit test couple of months ago. The investigation so far did not find any real failure. However, the test  checks whether `controller.kafkaController.controllerContext.partitionsBeingReassigned` contains partition being reassigned after verifying that reassignment znode does not exist anymore (via `ReassignPartitionsCommand.checkIfPartitionReassignmentSucceeded`). `controller.kafkaController.controllerContext.partitionsBeingReassigned` is updated after znode is deleted, so there is a very small chance that partitions still exists in `partitionsBeingReassigned`. This PR adds a waited check for `partitionsBeingReassigned`.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Partition reassignment should fail\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)\r\n\tat

PR is an attempt to fix the `RegexSourceIntegrationTest` flakiness.  My investigation did not reveal any issues, and I was unable to reproduce the failure locally.  So I've taken some steps to eliminate what I think could be a race condition in the test.\r\n\r\n1. Delete and create all topics before each test starts.\r\n2. Give the streams application in each test a unique application ID\r\n3. Create a `KafkaStreams` instance local to each test.\r\n\r\nIf the Jenkins build is all green for this PR, I will create a separate PR for `1.0` and make the same fixes up from `2.0` to `trunk`\r\nI ran the entire suite of streams tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

verify that ZK clients are closed in tests since these can affect subsequent tests and that makes it hard to debug test failures. But because of changes to ZooKeeper client, we are now checking the wrong thread name. The thread name used now is `<creatorThreadName>-EventThread` where `creatorThreadName` varies depending on the test. Fixed verification `ZooKeeperTestHarness` to check this format and fixed tests which were leaving ZK clients behind. Also added a test to make sure we can detect changes to the thread name when we update ZK clients in future.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

Goal\r\nIntroduce null-value handling to TimestampConverter SMT. \r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThe existing org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.TimestampConverter does not handle null values. When null value is passed to SMT the NPE is thrown. This PR introduces null vallue handling for this SMT.\r\n\r\n`schemaless null value` will result in `null record value`\r\n`schemaless null complex object` will result in `null record value`\r\n`null struct(has schema)` will result in `null record value with optional struct schema`\r\n`null struct(has schema) field` will result in `record value with null field value and optional struct schema for that field`\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nWe consider that original schema with null value will have optional modifier. Maybe we should be smarter and decide on the value of optional modifier based on the field actual nullability.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nUnit tests are provided\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded
