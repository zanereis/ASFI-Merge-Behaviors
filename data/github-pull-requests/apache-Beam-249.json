I chose to just switch to `NavigableSet` instead of doing anything more fancy, and eagerly delete timers, presuming there might be memory pressure if I lazily delete them only when they are popped from the queue.

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull

(Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a replay of ec0bf7b4023ff75f4ec6723d2e77ed507eb57c51 with an additional adapter commit that should enable integration tests to succeed.\r\n\r\nNote that this configuration of commits works well with the current capabilities of `git` and GitHub.  This behavior is not baked into the history, but is calculated dynamically by both, so it may improve over time.\r\n\r\nNotes on what would happen if this were done in one commit:\r\n\r\n - `git log --follow` finds the history\r\n - `git diff --find-copies` finds the copy\r\n - `git blame --find-copies-harder` finds the copy, but `--find-copies` does not\r\n\r\nI don't recall which level GitHub's UI works with, but the most important two are `git log` and `git blame`.

better.","created_at":"2016-12-17T04:44:34Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T19:36:19Z","closed_at":"2016-12-20T19:36:18Z","merged_at":"2016-12-20T19:36:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"69d2c47b6a476099535e9cefe62d4cce5ccafbc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/69d2c47b6a476099535e9cefe62d4cce5ccafbc1","head":{"label":"kennknowles:InMemoryTimerInternals","ref":"InMemoryTimerInternals","sha":"69d2c47b6a476099535e9cefe62d4cce5ccafbc1","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

I think this is right or at least the right compromise for many reasons.\r\n\r\n - `TimerInternals` is really runner-facing; we don't want that interface in the SDK.\r\n - Changes to `TimerInternals` incur worker compatibility concerns, so getting it into runners-core is a win. (I have to change it soon, so I am trying to make my life easier)\r\n - `DoFnTester` doesn't actually support timers at all, so it didn't make sense for them to be in there.\r\n - When `DoFnTester` does support timers, it is trivial to make its own priority queues, and it will also want to offer greater insight via a richer `TestingTimerInternals` sort of implementation, which needs not implement the same interface, etc.","created_at":"2016-12-16T04:52:33Z","updated_at":"2016-12-16T21:47:07Z","closed_at":"2016-12-16T21:47:07Z","merged_at":"2016-12-16T21:47:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec0bf7b4023ff75f4ec6723d2e77ed507eb57c51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/ec0bf7b4023ff75f4ec6723d2e77ed507eb57c51","head":{"label":"kennknowles:InMemoryTimerInternals","ref":"InMemoryTimerInternals","sha":"ec0bf7b4023ff75f4ec6723d2e77ed507eb57c51","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [ ] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [ ] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMost PTransforms which take a filePattern have construction-time\r\nvalidation which checks-- among other things-- that the specified\r\nfilePattern matches at least one file. This is particularly useful\r\nfor catching typos when specifying input files.\r\n\r\nMost PTransforms also have an option to disable their\r\nconstruction-time validation.  This is generally used when\r\nvalidation cannot be performed at construction time: for example\r\nbecause the proper credentials aren't available or the input\r\nspecification is late-bound in a template. To allow for these\r\nscenarios and still guard against typos, FileBasedSource also\r\nvalidates that the filePattern matches at least one file at\r\nruntime.\r\n\r\nThis change adds the ability FileBasedSource to disable this runtime\r\nvalidation, for cases uses case where empty filePatterns should be\r\nallowed. FileBasedSource gains a new constructor parameter, and\r\nPTransforms which use FileBasedSource have the option exposed in their\r\nrespective builder APIs.","created_at":"2016-12-15T18:29:19Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T20:00:06Z","closed_at":"2017-02-27T22:53:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e9c225e32aeb89fd7b755b1b30f62cc943dadc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/43195ba27b4303c852e81fa1de493ec4fec641bb","head":{"label":"swegner:read-allow-empty-glob","ref":"read-allow-empty-glob","sha":"43195ba27b4303c852e81fa1de493ec4fec641bb","user":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52832170,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjgzMjE3MA==","name":"beam","full_name":"swegner/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swegner/beam","description":"Mirror

logged.","created_at":"2016-12-15T18:19:25Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T23:59:00Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T23:59:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6644e59113cad2e8fdd814f13479005e5f46fca2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1625/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1625/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1625/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/125223f8feb3576d3ff5ccdffa58a5e80808286c","head":{"label":"bjchambers:fix-metrics-warning","ref":"fix-metrics-warning","sha":"125223f8feb3576d3ff5ccdffa58a5e80808286c","user":{"login":"bjchambers","id":35960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers","html_url":"https://github.com/bjchambers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53010511,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzAxMDUxMQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"bjchambers/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bjchambers","id":35960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers","html_url":"https://github.com/bjchambers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bjchambers/beam","description":"Mirror
