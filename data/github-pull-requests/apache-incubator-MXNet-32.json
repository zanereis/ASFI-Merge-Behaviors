Description ##\r\nWhen using MKLDNN batch norm, uint8 input needs to be reordered (since MKLDNN bn only supports int8 input). This pr is to address the misuse of original data memory and reordered data memory.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] fix uint8 bn reorder memory\r\n- [x] update resnet152-v2 int8 acc\r\n\r\n## Performance ##\r\n| model | FP32 (Top-1 / Top-5) | Fusion + int8 bn |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| resnet152-v2| 76.65% / 93.07% | 76.25% / 92.89% |\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel  @ZhennanQin @ciyongch

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-29T02:07:11Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T05:12:35Z","closed_at":"2019-09-12T05:12:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c631982cc099fba7d9f48b7a5d8d8c5cb4f8df1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/12a15cb181a37614d58baba78ad8c770f31ac868","head":{"label":"ZhennanQin:update_dmlc","ref":"update_dmlc","sha":"12a15cb181a37614d58baba78ad8c770f31ac868","user":{"login":"ZhennanQin","id":39290748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjkwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39290748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhennanQin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137315010,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzczMTUwMTA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"ZhennanQin/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZhennanQin","id":39290748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjkwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39290748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhennanQin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/follower

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-28T16:35:57Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T22:08:41Z","closed_at":"2019-08-29T22:08:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b812e3daee2d85dc02afdfc8c442ab1a6cfc1936","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":821540470,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjE1NDA0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/FP16","name":"FP16","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":919645457,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTk2NDU0NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C%20API","name":"C

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nNumpy element-wise operator [bitwise_and](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.bitwise_and.html#numpy.bitwise_and) added.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added a new InferShape method `ElemwiseIntType` that can be used to constrain dtypes to ints. \r\n- Added numpy element-wise operator: [bitwise_and](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.bitwise_and.html#numpy.bitwise_and) \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Since boolean array is not supported yet, this operator now only supports calculation between integer scalars  / ndarrays. May need some change to support boolean arrays in the future. @reminisce

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds ONNX conversion for dynamic reshape that has been added in PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15872. The operator conversion is being tested through the conversion of PyTorch model to MXNet through ONNX (testing import). And converting the resultant MXNet model back to ONNX (testing export).\r\n\r\nCan be merged only after https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15872, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15993, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15995\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- ONNX import/export dynamic shape\r\n- Changes required to make ONNX export of dynamic shapes possible\r\n- Tests to convert Pytorch->ONNX->MXNet->ONNX.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nFixes apache/incubator-mxnet#13774\r\nFixes apache/incubator-mxnet#13395\r\nFixes apache/incubator-mxnet#13949\r\nFixes

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nSupport ONNX import/export of Upsampling operator. \r\n\r\nFixes #12851 \r\nDepends on https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15811\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add ONNX importer/exporter, relevant test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This depends on another PR which adds support for tuple of scales in upsampling operator. Ack: @benhe2011 for testing this PR and updating upsampling operator.","created_at":"2019-08-24T19:13:34Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T13:37:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3b85b72b74c2fdcf3c845058000fbe42397cc85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":890967059,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4OTA5NjcwNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/ONNX","name":"ONNX","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nMXNet doesn't have a constant op for sym API (similar to gluon.constant). The closest is to map it to BlockGrad as discussed in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/6087. It would be useful to have a constant operator in general, and it is also required to convert Pytorch models to MXNet through ONNX.\r\n\r\nAdding support for this operator here.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add a constant operator in contrib, add relevant tests\r\n- Add ONNX conversion for contrib.constant, and relevant tests\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nAdded python list and set as supported types for parameter 'indices_or_sections'\r\nAdded python frontend support for [numpy.vsplit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.vsplit.html)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added python list and set as supported types for parameter 'indices_or_sections'\r\n- [x] Added python frontend support for [numpy.vsplit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.vsplit.html)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Note: numpy.split and numpy.vsplit still does not support type ndarray for parameter 'indices_or_sections'.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-23T06:17:48Z","updated_at":"2019-10-13T04:02:48Z","closed_at":"2019-10-13T04:02:48Z","merged_at":"2019-10-13T04:02:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b535a86513695f3c243c0185699516fe11ce12f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7772b43951e8d77257ba4071f932d89e9e2f0b17","head":{"label":"zoeygxy:np_vsplit_master","ref":"np_vsplit_master","sha":"7772b43951e8d77257ba4071f932d89e9e2f0b17","user":{"login":"zoeygxy","id":33736316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzM2MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33736316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy","html_url":"https://github.com/zoeygxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192449299,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI0NDkyOTk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zoeygxy/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zoeygxy","id":33736316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzM2MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33736316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy","html_url":"https://github.com/zoeygxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zoeygxy/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdd Standard deviation module\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-23T05:01:12Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T07:40:08Z","closed_at":"2020-09-07T07:40:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5389f87f988d0ee11db537adb8d542f08784f844","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nRelated to #15971\r\n### Root Cause\r\nWhen linker link the object files, it uses relative addressing method. The error happens when the project is too large for linker to link the target objects using relative addressing with 32-bit address.\r\n### Things we have tried\r\n1. add -fPIC flag to make sure the shared library can be loaded at any address in memory. It end up with the same error message.\r\n2. add -mcmodel=large. GCC default use -mcmodel=small where the program and symbols must be linked within 2 GB which is 32 bit address space. When it is set to large, there is no 2GB limitation. Unfortunately, all the code MXNet statically link including MKLDNN will need to build this way. It also ended up with same failure. So it leaded to our final solution.\r\n3. Removing the test_coverage flag which injects monitoring code every if else branch, while loop, etc.It dramatically increase the size of libmxnet.a with test coverage. After removing the test coverage flag, it passed the Clang MKLDNN CI job.\r\n\r\nAfter discussion with @marcoabreu, we agreed to disable C++ backend test coverage monitoring, which will also boost the CI.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@marcoabreu could you help check if some runtime functions are missing or some functions should not disable?

Description ##\r\nIssue #15971\r\nDisable Clang MKLDNN job\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-22T18:27:05Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T21:35:11Z","closed_at":"2019-08-22T21:35:11Z","merged_at":"2019-08-22T21:35:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa16a9e269713100a3def29aa1c88a1d174d21c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d3585f7d45a656285e423f36f05d83c789698584","head":{"label":"stu1130:disable_test_coverage","ref":"disable_test_coverage","sha":"d3585f7d45a656285e423f36f05d83c789698584","user":{"login":"stu1130","id":6792331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTIzMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130","html_url":"https://github.com/stu1130","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143350706,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDMzNTA3MDY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"stu1130/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stu1130","id":6792331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTIzMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130","html_url":"https://github.com/stu1130","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stu1130/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2,

Description ##\r\nAdds partitioning support for Gluon HybridBlocks. This is a continuation of the partitioning support for Symbol #15886\r\n\r\n## Design ##\r\nIn Gluon, a HybridBlock contains a Symbol after hybridizing and executing a forward pass. The Symbol is contained and managed within the block. The partitioning logic will be integrated into the hybridize flow. \r\n\r\nThere are many ways to create a Gluon Hybrid block and after this process, users call the `hybridize()` function to start the flow. We add two new arguments to support partitioning: `backend` which is a string corresponding to the `subgraph_backend` name, and `opt_args` which is a map of arguments that should be passed to the `subgraph_property` during partitioning. These values are stored until used during the first inference call. Heres an example specifying these new arguments:\r\n```\r\nnet = create()\r\nnet.hybridize(backend='default', opt_args={excluded_ops=['BatchNorm']}) \r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that in the above example, the new arguments have the same value as the example in #15886. These arguments will ultimately be passed to a call to the `optimize_for` API. \r\n\r\nIn the Gluon, the hybridize flow starts before the first inference. The Symbol object is created in the `_build_cache` function:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/bd67723da96e6d36e72c9a42535a4fe68f234a71/python/mxnet/gluon/block.py#L933-L934\r\nWe'll add a new line of code to partition it and pass the new arguments from the hybridize call:\r\n```\r\ndef _build_cache(self, *args):\r\n        data, out = self._get_graph(*args)\r\n        if self.backend:\r\n                out = out.optimize_for(self.backend, **self.opt_args)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis supports the partitioning flow without shape/type propagation. Some backends do not need shapes and types so there is no reason to require it for all backends. Other backends will require shapes and types in order to partition the model correctly (examples being backends that only support float16 and not float32, or only support small shapes and not large ones). \r\n\r\nFor the partitioning with with shape/type propagation we can get the args to the model from the parameters in the Gluon block. By default, the initialization of Gluon parameters may be delayed. If the parameters are not initialized yet, we'll continue with the flow shown in the code snippet above that does not infer shapes/types. \r\n\r\nIn Gluon users can force initialization ([see this guide](https://d2l.ai/chapter_deep-learning-computation/deferred-init.html#forced-initialization)) and if all parameters are initialized after calling `hybridize` and setting the `backend` name, we will pass the arguments from the Gluon parameters into the `optimize_for` API to infer shapes/types before partitioning. This gives the user the control over partitioning in the same way that they do for Symbol API. Heres a code snippet to produce the arg array and pass it to `optimize_for`:\r\n```\r\narg_array = []\r\ntry:\r\n    for name in out.list_arguments():\r\n        if name in data_names.keys():\r\n            arg_array.append(args[data_names[name]])\r\n        else:\r\n            arg_array.append(params.get(name))\r\nexcept DeferredInitializationError:\r\n    arg_array = None\r\nexcept RuntimeError:\r\n    arg_array = None\r\nout = out.optimize_for(self._backend, arg_array, ctx, **self._backend_args)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe context will be gathered from the inputs to the model like this:\r\n```\r\nctx = args[0].context\r\n```\r\nContext is required to infer storage types.\r\n\r\n### Note \r\nPartitioning is done as part of the hybridize flow, when building the cachedOp. So if shapes change between infer calls the graph is not re-partitioned. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Refactor subgraph tests, returns input names and shapes (needed for gluon). improves test architecture to be more clear about what we're testing (subgraph API, optimize for, gluon).

Description ##\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @xinyu-intel @reminisce @KellenSunderland @anirudh2290\r\nMajor changes:\r\n* Don't need `calib_layer`, the layer list which needs calibrated will be generated from quantization pass, so user don't need to specify that. Only needed layer get calibrated, thus improve the calibration speed.\r\n\r\n* Entropy is refactored, only histogram of output is saved, which will help to reduce memory consumption. Entropy calculation is refactored as c++ operator, accuracy is improved, then entropy method can get same speed as naive.\r\n\r\n\r\nModel | FP32 Accuracy | INT8 Naïve | INT8 entropy_old | INT8 entropy_new\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nResNet50-V1 | 76.340% | 76.060% | 76.006% | 76.053%\r\nSqueezenet 1.0 | 56.980% | 56.790% | 55.584% | 56.997%\r\nMobileNet 1.0 | 72.230% | 72.060% | 71.822% | 71.822%\r\nMobileNetV2 1.0 | 70.270% | 69.820% | 69.950% | 70.016%\r\nInception V3 | 77.760% | 78.050% | 78.019% | 78.053%\r\nInception-BN | 72.280% | 72.020% | 72.084% | 71.978%\r\nmean_for_all | 70.977% | 70.800% | 70.578% | 70.820%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Add new quantization mode `smart`, which will automatically decide each op should be quantized or not. This mode will only quantize nodes which have performance benefit(e.g. convolution and FC), and necessary nodes. For example, `A` is convolution or FC, which will be all quantized. `B` is Relu or Add, which is quantizable and quantization flow will make decision whether to quantize it or not. `C` is non-quantized node. For `A -> B -> A`, `B` will be quantized as it can pass down int8 data. For `C->B->C`, `A -> B -> C`, or `C -> B -> A`, `B` won't be quantized. \r\n\r\n* Add log for quantization flow, this can help to user to understand what quantization flow does and what's changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nDo not merge this PR.  This PR is experimenting with seeds of the test_laop_6 unittest.  The PR is seeking to learn if errors seen with the 64-bit windows build toolchain are observable on the 32-bit windows build\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-21T02:53:35Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T07:37:07Z","closed_at":"2020-09-07T07:37:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19bc7c36f5fd0a6090039f9cd7f444d7456ebe88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to add the support for fullyconnected and some element-wise (including activation/square/sqrt/exp/abs/clip) ops fusion.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nCurrent memory alignment in topk operator is incorrect if index_t is using int64_t. This PR fixes the potential issue. It partially fixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15703\r\n\r\nThe PR also fixes an incorrect data type usage in mshadow/tensor.h\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA

title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n- Added boolean ndarray infra in mshadow.\r\n- Implemented comparison operators: equal, not_equal, greater, greater_equal, less, and less_equal to use `np.bool_` as their output tensors' `dtype`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nFollow-up work includes:\r\n- More operators that can consume boolean ndarrays. To list a few that must be finished before the next release:\r\n  - sum\r\n  - cast\r\n  - boolean_mask\r\n- `ndarray` [boolean indexing](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/arrays.indexing.html#boolean-array-indexing)\r\n\r\nThank @yzhliu @hzfan for the help on

Description ##\r\n`test_operator.test_convolution_independent_gradients` may cost too much occasionally, leading to terminated failed CIs. As it was discussed in ISSUE #15880, `test_random.test_shuffle` was also time-consuming, which has been already fixed by PR #15922. This PR aims to reduce the cost of `test_convolution_independent_gradients` by discarding some needless test cases. @pengzhao-intel @ciyongch @TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x]

Description ##\r\nUse tvm to implement vadd backward with broadcast.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add vadd backward\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- As vadd is not a Numpy op, 0-dim and 0-size is not supported.\r\n- For now, I implemented infra-level things on op-level, like\r\n  - dispatch of different req\r\n  - dispatch of backward\r\n\r\nI think code for these may be further reused in the future. It'll be great if we can have a consistent interface for tvm op and hide the dispatch of things like req and backward.\r\n\r\nThank @yzhliu and @junrushao1994 for the brilliant \"compressed bit

Description ##\r\nUpgrade ps-lite dependency\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-17T23:25:14Z","updated_at":"2019-09-01T19:15:12Z","closed_at":"2019-09-01T19:15:07Z","merged_at":"2019-09-01T19:15:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"6997691921f66889d5796dbacd82bdf4fbbcf38e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n\r\nRemove the dtype argument from parameter structure and use ElemwiseType instead.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-16T15:26:20Z","updated_at":"2019-08-25T23:37:40Z","closed_at":"2019-08-25T23:37:40Z","merged_at":"2019-08-25T23:37:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7a8a788bd2f7525794473c4d2f2bab4ad3dee59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1268b6ba998284b783c4924f11b37c0e40946396","head":{"label":"TaoLv:fix-arange-like-dtype","ref":"fix-arange-like-dtype","sha":"1268b6ba998284b783c4924f11b37c0e40946396","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR can be thought of as an alternate proposal to PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15882 as far as how to handle the 'out of heap space' errors of the windows CI.  This PR follows the suggestion of @marcoabreu to break up the problematic large-compiles into smaller pieces, rather than moving the Windows compiler toolchain to 64-bit.\r\n\r\nThe PR breaks apart ./src/operator/tensor/broadcast_reduce_op_value.{cu,cc}, a top cause of the 'out of heap space' errors.  Also, because of its mention in issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13958, the PR breaks apart ./src/operator/tensor/elemwise_unary_op_basic.{cu,cc}.  The PR also cherry-picks a test_shuffle speed-up to help get the PR through CI without timing out.  The PR no longer modifies test_laop_6, which was seen to fail sporadically with access violations on a different PR.\r\n\r\nThe pitch: smaller compiler tasks are more easily parallelized over the CPU cores in a 'make -j N' scenario, though it's not clear if total compile time is reduced.  It may decrease the time needed for a failing compile to complete- a help for those that like to isolate a current compile problem with a follow-up simple 'make' command.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-15T21:28:40Z","updated_at":"2019-08-18T00:40:22Z","closed_at":"2019-08-18T00:40:22Z","merged_at":"2019-08-18T00:40:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a6fe602e0e445cc3b052b4103069b7c6f5bf012","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/56962f24fd99ca1827cbeb4e0048efd0fc1184ac","head":{"label":"DickJC123:refactor_for_windows_ci","ref":"refactor_for_windows_ci","sha":"56962f24fd99ca1827cbeb4e0048efd0fc1184ac","user":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86116214,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjExNjIxNA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"DickJC123/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nEnhancements to dynamic library loading to support custom operators in libraries.\r\n- added MXTensor/MXDtype structure, and versioning to lib_api.h\r\n- added similar NNVM register op-like capability for custom ops\r\n- operators are found in the library, and re-registered in MXNet during library loading\r\n- operators are re-registered from mx.nd.op to mx.nd and mx.sym.op to mx.sym shortcuts\r\n- Created a new example library in \"example/lib_ops\" with a GEMM operator\r\n\r\nInitially, this project was [proposed on the CWiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Dynamic+CustomOp+Support), however the design has evolved since the initial proposal. The current design is described below.\r\n\r\n## Design ##\r\nThe goal of this PR to to enable operators to be implemented in separate libraries and loaded at runtime\r\n\r\nThe main constraint is to maintain a low-level C-types only boundary between MXNet and the library to simplify the building and compiling of external libraries. \r\n\r\nWorking backwards from the user, users register operators with easy-to-use function prototypes like:\r\n```\r\nint myForward(std::map<std::string,std::string> attrs,\r\n               std::vector<MXTensor> inputs, \r\n               std::vector<MXTensor> outputs);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers' `Forward` (ie. `FCompute`) functions are called by a helper function `_opCallFCompute` that converts the C-types passed across the library boundary to the familiar STL types. This function is implemented in the `lib_api.h` header file that users compile with their library. \r\n```\r\nint _opCallFCompute(fcomp_t fcomp, const char* const* keys, const char* const* vals, int num,\r\n                    const int64_t** inshapes, int* indims, void** indata, int* intypes, int num_in,\r\n                    const int64_t** outshapes, int* outdims, void** outdata, int* outtypes, int num_out);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn MXNet's C API, the `_opCallFCompute` function is found in the library. A lambda function `fcomp_conv` is created for each operator loaded from the library to convert from MXNet-types to C-types. Then these C-types are passed to `_opCallFCompute`. \r\n\r\n```\r\nauto fcomp_conv = [=](const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs,\r\n                      const OpContext& ctx,\r\n                      const std::vector<TBlob>& inputs,\r\n                      const std::vector<OpReqType>& req,\r\n                      const std::vector<TBlob>& outputs);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same design is used for: parseAttrs, inferShape, inferType, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, an operator is re-registered in MXNet with the lambda function like:\r\n```\r\nnnvm::Op &regOp = dmlc::Registry<nnvm::Op>::Get()->__REGISTER_OR_GET__(name);\r\nregOp.set_attr<FCompute>(\"FCompute<cpu>\",fcomp_conv);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the C API returns back to Python in the `load` function in `library.py`, we regenerate the Python bindings and re-register the operator shortcuts to mx.nd and mx.sym.\r\n\r\nAfter the `load` function returns back to the user's Python code, they can then use their operators just like any other operate:\r\n```\r\nmx.nd.myCustomOp(A,B,C)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current Features ###\r\n- custom CPU operators\r\n- stateless & stateful operators\r\n- custom subgraph operators\r\n- Memory resource request\r\n- \r\n\r\n### Future/Next-steps ###\r\n(to be done in a separate PR)\r\n- custom GPU operators\r\n- Random number generator resource request\r\n- sparse data types\r\n- migrate lambda functions in MXLoadLib in src/c_api/c_api.cc to classes defined elsewhere\r\n- Documentation, add the \"library\" python package to the namespace to the doc: https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/api/ ?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- updated path to be absolute in example/lib_api/test.py\r\n- update the Makefile/CMakeLists.txt to build the new example in lib_ops instead of lib_api\r\n- moved library import in python/mxnet/__init__.py to after ndarray/symbol\r\n- added operator reregistration to python/mxnet/library.py\r\n- added operator discovery/registration in MXLoadLib in src/c_api/c_api.cc\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nFixes error when loading empty params file (fixes #15916)\r\nAdded check for unknown params in params file, was silently ignoring before\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nnumpy compatible [einsum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html)\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add einsum\r\n- add einsum doc\r\n- add path optimization\r\n- add benchmark\r\n- add forward and backward test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- support both explicit and implicit mode\r\n- support multiple operands\r\n- support broadcast\r\n- support 0-dim NDArray and 0-size NDArray\r\n- cannot work until multiple tempspace is enabled\r\n  - einsum make use of multiple temspace, but set MXNET_GPU_TEMP_COPY to 4 triggers a bug\r\n  - simply to set MXNET_GPU_TEMP_COPY to 4 (without the presence of einsum) triggers the bug. So this might be a bug of mxnet itself.\r\n  - solution 1: fix the bug (may be difficult)\r\n  - solution 2: implement einsum in another way and sidestep this feature.\r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n- [x] translate einsum_path into c, so that optimization can work in symbol mode\r\n- [x] take advantage of tensordot when it is merged\r\n- [x] support \"greedy\" optimization\r\n- [ ] support \"optimal\" optimization\r\n\r\nThank @reminisce and @haojin2 for guidance and

Description ##\r\nImplement basic slicing in symbolic interface\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add **npx_reshape** to support reshape with special flags  \r\n    - -1 to infer this dimension from the other given dimensions\r\n    - -2 copy the current dimension from the input to the output\r\n    - -3 skip the current dimension if and only if the current dimension is of size 1, report an error otherwise\r\n    - -4 copy all remaining dimensions from the input to the output\r\n    - -5 use the product of the next two consecutive dimensions in the output\r\n    - -6 split current dimension in the output into the next two  dimensions in the input\r\n\r\n- Implement basic slicing in __symbol.py_ : \\_\\_getitem\\_\\_, basic slicing means slicing with \r\n    - an integer \r\n    - a pyslice\r\n    - a tuple of integers and pyslices\r\n\r\nA flag `_output_is_list` is added to symbol class in the frontend to differentiate the cases in which a symbol with only one output Node is conceptually a list, eg: `split(x, 1)`\r\n\r\n- Overload the `Group` function in Symbol\r\n- Overload the `save`, `save_json_string`, `load`, `load_json_string` to specially take care of the newly added flag\r\n\r\n## Comments

bindings)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR is experimental and should not be merged.  It's goal is to see if the improvements in going to the 64-bit Windows toolchain in PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15882 will fix the issues of a pending softmax PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15545 that has been reliably experiencing the 'out of heap space' error.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nAdded new tests to verify support for Large Tensors and new C_Apis to support 64bit indexing \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-14T22:48:04Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T21:33:16Z","closed_at":"2019-08-20T21:33:15Z","merged_at":"2019-08-20T21:33:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"308e4acc1acd34d8492154a0076edd507e4908f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR
