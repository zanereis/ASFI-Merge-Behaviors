SQL's JDBC data source allows users to specify an explicit JDBC driver to load (using the `driver` argument), but in the current code it's possible that the user-specified driver will not be used when it comes time to actually create a JDBC connection.\n\nIn a nutshell, the problem is that you might have multiple JDBC drivers on the classpath that claim to be able to handle the same subprotocol, so simply registering the user-provided driver class with the our `DriverRegistry` and JDBC's `DriverManager` is not sufficient to ensure that it's actually used when creating the JDBC connection.\n\nThis patch addresses this issue by first registering the user-specified driver with the DriverManager, then iterating over the driver manager's loaded drivers in order to obtain the correct driver and use it to create a connection (previously, we just called `DriverManager.getConnection()` directly).\n\nIf a user did not specify a JDBC driver to use, then we call `DriverManager.getDriver` to figure out the class of the driver to use, then pass that class's name to executors; this guards against corner-case bugs in situations where the driver and executor JVMs might have different sets of JDBC drivers on their classpaths (previously, there was the (rare) potential for `DriverManager.getConnection()` to use different drivers on the driver and executors if the user had not explicitly specified a JDBC driver class and the classpaths were different).\n\nThis patch is inspired by a similar patch that I made to the `spark-redshift` library (https://github.com/databricks/spark-redshift/pull/143), which contains its own modified fork of some of Spark's JDBC data source code (for cross-Spark-version compatibility

The PR has been taken over from @nongli (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10420). I have removed some additional dead code, and fixed a few issues which were caused by the fact that the inlined Hive parser is newer than the Hive parser we currently use in Spark.\n\nI am submitting this PR in order to get some feedback and testing done. There is quite a bit of work to do:\n- [ ] Get it to pass jenkins build/test.\n- [ ] Aknowledge Hive-project for using their parser.\n- [ ] Refactorings between HiveQl and the java classes.\n  - [ ] Create our own ASTNode and integrate the current implicit extentions.\n  - [ ] Move remaining `SemanticAnalyzer` and `ParseUtils` functionality to `HiveQl`.\n- [ ] Removing Hive dependencies from the parser. This will require some edits in the grammar files.\n  - [ ] Introduce our own context which needs to contain a `TokenRewriteStream`.\n  - [ ] Add `useSQL11ReservedKeywordsForIdentifier` and `allowQuotedId` to the catalyst or sql configuration.\n  - [ ] Remove `HiveConf` from grammar files &HiveQl, and pass in our own configuration.\n- [ ] Moving the parser into sql/core.\n\ncc @nongli

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12355\nThis is similar with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10427.\n\nAs discussed here https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10221, this PR implemented `unhandledFilter` to remove duplicated Spark-side filtering.\n\nIn case of Parquet, the columns referenced in pushed down filters should be given to `org.apache.spark.sql.parquet.row.requested_schema` whereas general datasources such as JDBC do not require the columns.\n\nHowever, `DataSourceStrategy.pruneFilterProjectRaw()` removes the columns only referenced in pushed down filters. Therefore, this PR resolved this problem by manually generating the columns referenced in pushed down filters.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nThis was tested with unittests and with `dev/run_tests` for coding

use scalastyle:off to turn off style checks in certain places where it is not possible to follow the style guide. This is usually ok. However, in udf registration, we disable the checker for a large amount of code simply because some of them exceed 100 char line limit. It is better to just disable the line limit check rather than everything.\n\nIn this pull request, I only disabled line length check, and fixed a problem (lack explicit types for public

PR adds bucket write support to Spark SQL. User can specify bucketing columns, numBuckets and sorting columns with or without partition columns. For example:\n\n```\ndf.write.partitionBy(\"year\").bucketBy(8, \"country\").sortBy(\"amount\").saveAsTable(\"sales\")\n```\n\nWhen bucketing is used, we will calculate bucket id for each record, and group the records by bucket id. For each group, we will create a file with bucket id in its name, and write data into it. For each bucket file, if sorting columns are specified, the data will be sorted before write.\n\nNote that there may be multiply files for one bucket, as the data is distributed.\n\nCurrently we store the bucket metadata at hive metastore in a non-hive-compatible way. We use different bucketing hash function compared to hive, so we can't be compatible anyway.\n\nLimitations:\n- Can't write bucketed data without hive metastore.\n- Can't insert bucketed data into existing hive tables.

ran successfully on the 1.5 branch as well.\n\nAccording to `mvn dependency:tree` it is still pulling a fairly old version of the aws-java-sdk (1.9.37), but this appears to have fixed the kinesis regression in 1.5.2.\n","created_at":"2015-12-28T04:24:29Z","updated_at":"2016-01-05T23:20:21Z","closed_at":"2016-01-05T23:17:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c75a9a00def1be7125c0742b1fa41df24c92888","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10492/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10492/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10492/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/137bafdd47fecbae4d48e0618d7c2e84195484b6","head":{"label":"BrianLondon:remove-only","ref":"remove-only","sha":"137bafdd47fecbae4d48e0618d7c2e84195484b6","user":{"login":"BrianLondon","id":8833562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzM1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8833562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon","html_url":"https://github.com/BrianLondon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47775060,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Nzc3NTA2MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"BrianLondon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BrianLondon","id":8833562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzM1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8833562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon","html_url":"https://github.com/BrianLondon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrianLondon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BrianLondon/spark","description":"Mirror

However, the result we returned is the `inner` join, which is the only type Spark 1.5 supports. (Note, starting from Spark 1.6, we can support the other types for equi-join). \n\nFor example, \n\n``` scala\njoined_table = left_table.join(right_table, \"joining_column\", \"outer\")\n```\n\nShould we also back port it to 1.4? @davies @JoshRosen

R API for `read.jdbc`, `write.jdbc`.\n\nTested this quite a bit manually with different combinations of parameters. It's not clear if we could have automated tests in R for this - Scala `JDBCSuite` depends on Java H2 in-memory database.\n\nRefactored some code into util so they could be tested.\n\nCore's R SerDe code needs to be updated to allow access to java.util.Properties as `jobj` handle which is required by DataFrameReader/Writer's `jdbc` method.

reading the JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12520, I double checked the code. \n\nFor example, users can do the Equi-Join like\n  `df.join(df2, 'name', 'outer').select('name', 'height').collect()`\n- There exists a bug in 1.5 and 1.4. The code just ignores the third parameter (join type) users pass. However, the join type we called is `Inner`, even if the user-specified type is the other type (e.g., `Outer`). \n- After a PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8600, the 1.6 does not have such an issue, but the description has not been updated.  \n\nPlan to submit another PR to fix 1.5 and issue an error message if users specify a non-inner join type when using Equi-Join.

StringIndexer, which does not yet support extra category for unseen labels.\n\nI would propose to extend the `HasHandleInvalid`  with more options in this or other PR, like,\n1. adding option \"allow\" and categorize all unseen labels to -1. (for customization, we need introduce another parameter).\n2. just encourage users to use `handleInvalid` to specify the category value for unseen labels.

patch adds a new build check which enumerates Spark's resolved runtime classpath and saves it to a file, then diffs against that file to detect whether pull requests have introduced dependency changes. The aim of this check is to make it simpler to reason about whether pull request which modify the build have introduced new dependencies or changed transitive dependencies in a way that affects the final classpath.\n\nThis supplants the checks added in SPARK-4123 / #5093, which are currently disabled due to bugs.\n\nThis patch is based on @pwendell's work in #8531.\n\nCloses #8531.\n","created_at":"2015-12-23T23:46:33Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T22:07:14Z","closed_at":"2015-12-30T20:49:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82ee5fb41029f2bba06510f506d8002c297038f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cc99de60dac21ff249d66209798b3b027717b398","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-10359","ref":"SPARK-10359","sha":"cc99de60dac21ff249d66209798b3b027717b398","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

Remove AkkaRpcEnv\n\nKeep `SparkEnv.actorSystem` because Streaming still uses it. Will remove it and AkkaUtils after refactoring Streaming actorStream API.\n### Remove systemName\n\nThere are 2 places using `systemName`:\n- `RpcEnvConfig.name`. Actually, although it's used as `systemName` in `AkkaRpcEnv`, `NettyRpcEnv` uses it as the service name to output the log `Successfully started service *** on port ***`. Since the service name in log is useful, I keep `RpcEnvConfig.name`.\n- `def setupEndpointRef(systemName: String, address: RpcAddress, endpointName: String)`. Each `ActorSystem` has a `systemName`. Akka requires `systemName` in its URI and will refuse a connection if `systemName` is not matched. However, `NettyRpcEnv` doesn't use it. So we can remove `systemName` from `setupEndpointRef` since we are removing `AkkaRpcEnv`.\n### Remove RpcEnv.uriOf\n\n`uriOf` exists because Akka uses different URI formats for with and without authentication, e.g., `akka.ssl.tcp...` and `akka.tcp://...`. But `NettyRpcEnv` uses the same format. So it's not necessary after removing `AkkaRpcEnv`.\n","created_at":"2015-12-23T22:24:57Z","updated_at":"2015-12-31T18:05:37Z","closed_at":"2015-12-31T08:17:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f6bbc60c4e3fc512a997fbdbeae10ba4fc1fe37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1aa9728bc238ebc69545b06b794127dc4a09e958","head":{"label":"zsxwing:remove-akka-rpc-env","ref":"remove-akka-rpc-env","sha":"1aa9728bc238ebc69545b06b794127dc4a09e958","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"93b52abca708aba90b6d0d36c92b920f6f8338ad","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

patch fixes a handful of minor bugs in the `dev/tests/pr_public_classes.sh` script, which is used by the `run_tests_jenkins` script to detect the addition of new public classes:\n- Account for differences between BSD and GNU `sed` in order to allow the script to run on OS X.\n- Diff `$ghprbActualCommit^...$ghprbActualCommit` instead of `master...$ghprbActualCommit`: since `ghprbActualCommit` is a merge commit which results from merging the PR into the target branch, this will give us the desired diff and will avoid certain race-conditions which could lead to false-positives.\n- Use `echo -e` instead of `echo` so that newline characters are handled correctly in output. This should fix a formatting glitch which caused the output to appear on a single line in the GitHub comment (see [the SC2028 page](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2028) on the Shellcheck wiki for more

that applies to a Limit on top of an OUTER Join. The original Limit won't go away after applying this rule, but additional Limit node(s) will be created on top of the outer-side child (or children if it's a FULL OUTER Join). \"\n– from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-832\n\nAlso, the same topic in Hive: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11684 This has been merged to HIVE. \n\nThis PR is for performance improvement. The idea is like predicate pushdown. It can reduce the number of rows processed by `Outer Joins`. The performance improvement is significant when the number of rows in Limit is small but the cost of `Join` is large. \n\nFor example, \n\n```\n    val df = Seq((1, 2, \"1\"), (3, 4, \"3\")).toDF(\"int\", \"int2\", \"str\").as('a)\n    val df2 = Seq((1, 3, \"1\"), (5, 6, \"5\")).toDF(\"int\", \"int2\", \"str\").as('b)\n    val join = df.join(df2, $\"a.int\" === $\"a.int\", \"outer\").limit(1)\n```\n\nAfter the improvement, we can see the changes in the optimized plan:\n\n```\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\nint: int, int2: int, str: string, int: int, int2: int, str: string\nLimit 1\n+- Join FullOuter, Some((int#3 = int#3))\n   :- Subquery a\n   :  +- Project [_1#0 AS int#3,_2#1 AS int2#4,_3#2 AS str#5]\n   :     +- LocalRelation [_1#0,_2#1,_3#2],

==\nLimit 1\n+- Join FullOuter, Some((int#3 = int#3))\n   :- LocalRelation [int#3,int2#4,str#5], [[1,2,1],[3,4,3]]\n   +- Limit 1  <---- extra limit is added\n      +- LocalRelation

PR is a draft version of another alternative of CNF normalization based on [comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8200/files#r48328448) in PR #8200. This PR doesn't include test cases, and is only for further discussion.\n\nIn this version, CNF normalization is implemented as a separate function `Predicate.toCNF`, which accepts an optional expansion threshold to prevent exponential explosion. The motivation behind this design is that, CNF normalization itself can be useful in other use cases (e.g., eliminating common predicate factors). It would be convenient if we can call it from anywhere without involving the optimizer.\n\nAnother consideration is that, if no expansion threshold is provided, `toCNF` should always return a predicate that is really in CNF. That's why a new `RuleExecutor` strategy `FixedPoint.Unlimited` is added.\n\nA major compromise here is that, we may not convert all predicates to CNF, and can't guarantee that filters passed to data sources are in CNF, thus we may lose potential optimization opportunities in front of complicated filter predicates.\n","created_at":"2015-12-23T09:32:41Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T02:28:17Z","closed_at":"2016-01-26T02:28:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e05d2edfe2f84665b6df9939504258364cb278d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e2c0524723b6689e17550dad2b515a6e7602cb4","head":{"label":"liancheng:cnf-draft","ref":"cnf-draft","sha":"6e2c0524723b6689e17550dad2b515a6e7602cb4","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

The null check is stripped off for top level product fields, which are mapped to the outermost `Row`s, since they can't be null.\n\nThanks @cloud-fan for helping investigating this
