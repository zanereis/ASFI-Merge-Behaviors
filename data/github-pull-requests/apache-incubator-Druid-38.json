The intent is to support window functions similarly to what postgresql does (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html) as well as Drill (https://drill.apache.org/docs/sql-window-functions-introduction/)\r\n\r\nThe commit is large and there is more work to do, but this lays the foundation of supporting window functions.  This PR is best read from a few entry points:\r\n\r\n1. The windowing functions are implemented as `Processor`s.  Looking at this interface will give an idea of how the actual window functions are implemented.  The biggest notion here is that `Processor`s deal with a `RowsAndColumns` object that represents a full partition.  Generally speaking, they believe that something else has prepared the `RowsAndColumns` for them which proves to be a nice simplifying assumption for their implementation.\r\n2. `RowsAndColumns` is an interface that represents a set of... rows and columns.  If you look at the interface, it is rather minimalist.  The idea here is to lean into the idea of `.as()` as has existed on Segments for a long time.  We use it to effectively build a \"menu\" of common, generic functionality that can be done on a batch of data and then Operators/Processors can be written in terms of that common, generic functionality.  The implementation in this PR provides naive implementations of this functionality, as we get deeper in future PRs, this functionality will get fleshed out and specialized more to avoid object copies and megamorphism while further offering love for vectorized processing.\r\n3. `Operator` is an interface introduced here.  `WindowOperatorQuery` is an operator-defined query for running Window operations on top of the results of a sub-query.  All of the logic for the operators is handled in `WindowOperatorQueryQueryToolChest.merge` right now.  Essentially, this PR has been co-opted to get Operators introduced into the Druid code base.  This means we are using window queries as an initial jumping off point for `Operators` to be introduced into the code flow.  We expect more and more iteration on this to expand the capabilities deeper and perhaps make a future world where Operator-only queries are a thing that Druid supports.\r\n4. `CalciteWindowQueryTest` leverages the recent changes that brought us the `QueryTestBuilder` to have fully file-driven tests.  For the window functions, we needed more data, so I've moved the wikipedia dataset that was checked in as part of `environment` to be in the `resources` of the test jar.  We then index that and reference it in the tests.  The tests sit in `calcite/tests/window` of resources, each file is a SQL query, the window Operator structure that we expect to be built from it and the expected results.  Hopefully, this will simplify the addition of test cases making it easier for someone to add a test without necessarily knowing how to work with the code and fix it.\r\n\r\nThat said, this PR introduces various things, but it is not complete yet.  This is a first step and there are still sharp edges/unimplemented functionality.  That said, what exists here does work for a subset of use cases and is a meaningful milestone that can be committed while we iterate on fleshing out and finishing up the functionality.  As such, I'd like to get this reviewed and committed before making it even larger.  All interfaces introduced in this PR are experimental and the \"windowOperator\" query is also intended to be experimental.  Given that this is still experimental, I am intending to merge this PR as an undocumented feature, which we will document better as we get the sharp edges resolved.\r\n\r\n#### Sharp Edges\r\n\r\n1. The window function support does not yet support \"frames\" (`ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING` style clauses).\r\n2. The support is not yet fully aware of the difference between `RANGE` and `ROWS` when evaluating peers.  (The built-in functions are all implemented with the correctly defined semantics, similar to what the postgresql document says above)\r\n3. All window functions in one query must use the same windowing definition (the code cannot currently support 2 different `PARTITION BY X` clauses)\r\n4. The windowing logic will not re-sort the data.  It assumes that the sub-query was written such that data is pre-sorted in the way that the windowing logic expects.\r\n\r\nThese sharp edges are in the weeds enough that this support should still be considered experimental and it should exist as an undocumented feature.  Subsequent PRs will smooth out these sharp edges.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNone as the intent is for this to be an undocumented, experimental addition.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.","created_at":"2022-11-22T11:02:52Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T00:21:00Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T00:21:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"376f045459a5aac59a2f3879adaf737de5052726","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThe first run of a supervisor tries to resume all actively reading tasks and shuts down any tasks which fail to resume successfully in #13223.\r\n\r\nHowever it included pending / waiting tasks in the set of active tasks and killed them as they failed to resume.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nThe fix is to check if the task is also running using the TaskRunner before attempting to resume and fail tasks.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a regression caused by #13375 where null ORC inputs would be processed into `{}` instead of `null` as expected. \r\n\r\nThe cause of the regression was allowing the nested types to be returned during conversion to support nested ingestion, which exposed another underlying oddity of why the values were ending up as empty maps instead of `null`.\r\n\r\nThe ORC json provider `isMap` method looks like this\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public boolean isMap(final Object o)\r\n  {\r\n    return o == null || o instanceof Map || o instanceof OrcStruct;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nwhich is a bit strange, however is consistent with the other implementations of other nested formats. This means `toPlainJavaObject` will treat `null` as a map for most types, resulting in the empty map when converting to java objects. I haven't quite discovered why these are implemented like this (if it was me, i cannot remember 😅), but to avoid changing the behavior here, `toMap` now checks for `null` response from `toPlainJavaObject` and returns an empty map if so, so that `toPlainJavaObject` will not translate `null` into an empty map.\r\n\r\nWhile writing a test for this I noticed that `toPlainJavaObject` could still leak format specific types since the fall through value was not 'finalized' like the values inside of maps and lists are, so the json `NullNode` for example by processing a `null` input row would cause the sampler to explode. I'm unsure how common this example is, but it seems safer to finalize the values the fall through just to be safe.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x]

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when using `KafkaInputFormat` with Druid nested columns, where any nested data was effectively unable to be ingested when using this format, _unless_ the nested columns were added explicitly to the `flattenSpec` of the underlying format. The reason for this is because Druid nested column indexer and nested data transformation functions such as `json_value` rely on the `flattenSpec` machinery to extract and convert data from various nested formats into plain java objects.\r\n\r\nThe `KafkaInputFormat` was eagerly copying the value payload `Map` (which was a flattener) and blending it with the 'header' `Map` to make a composite input row, however currently nested columns do not advertise on flattener `keySet`, so when this copy happened the nested data was left out, leading to always seeing `null` valued inputs when using Druid nested indexer or transforms.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the issue by building a `Map` which delegates to the payload map before falling back to the header map, allowing the underlying flattener from the payload to keep doing its thing.\r\n\r\nThe added test cases all fail prior to the changes in this patch with errors of the form:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpected :{mg=1}\r\nActual   :null\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

Description\r\nFixes an issue with nested column range index computation which was resulting in an off by 1 on the end index. #13297 almost fixed all of the issues, but as a showcase of how test line and branch coverage just tells you what you want to hear, the test cases were missing a scenario where the end of the range was missing locally, and there were additional global values between the global id of the 'insertion point' of the missing value and the actual global end value. I've added data to the test which covers this case to the string dictionary (which caused a few additional tests to fail prior to the fixes in this PR), as well as additional test cases for range indexes to i think cover all of the scenarios.... i hope 😅 \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

Description\r\n\r\nThe batch segment sampling added in #11257 performs significantly better than the older method of sampling if there are a large number of used segments. It also avoid duplicate results in sampling.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Make batch segment sampling the default\r\n- Deprecate the property `useBatchedSegmentSampler`\r\n- Remove unused coordinator config `druid.coordinator.loadqueuepeon.repeatDelay`\r\n- Cleanup `KillUnusedSegments`\r\n- Simplify `KillUnusedSegmentsTest`, add better tests, remove redundant tests\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nBatch sampling has been made the default method for sampling segments during balancing as it performs significantly better than the alternative when there is a large number of used segments in the cluster. \r\n\r\nThe following have been deprecated and will be removed in future releases:\r\n- coordinator dynamic config `useBatchedSegmentSampler`\r\n- coordinator dynamic config `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove`\r\n- non-batch method of sampling segments used during coordinator duty `BalanceSegments`\r\n\r\nThe unused coordinator property `druid.coordinator.loadqueuepeon.repeatDelay` has been removed.\r\nUse only `druid.coordinator.loadqueuepeon.http.repeatDelay` to configure repeat delay for the HTTP-based segment loading queue.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nShared locks are only acquired when all other locks are also shared locks.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be possible when all exclusive locks with the same or greater priority are revoked. If there are any exclusive locks with lower priority, it must be possible to revoke them and allocate a shared lock.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

inclusion of all stream partitions in all tasks.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe PR (Adds Idle feature to `SeekableStreamSupervisor` for inactive stream) - https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13144 updates the resulting lag calculation map in `KafkaSupervisor` to include all the latest partitions from the stream to set the idle state accordingly rather than the previous way of lag calculation only for the partitions actively being read from the stream. This led to an explosion of metrics in lag reports in cases where 1000s of tasks per supervisor are present.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new method to generate lags for only those partitions a single task is actively reading from while updating the Supervisor reports.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KafkaSupervisor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nAdds missing `VectorObjectSelector` for multi-value `STRING` typed columns. Several complex aggregators use `VectorObjectSelector` when they don't care for dealing with or can't do anything useful with dictionary lookup stuff directly, so this fills in the missing selector implementation to ensure if it is called that it doesn't explode.\r\n\r\nWhile I was here, this selector creating code is heavily copied between `StringDictionaryEncodedColumn`, `StringFrontCodedDictionaryEncodedColumn`, and even `NestedFieldLiteralDictionaryEncodedColumn`, so I have refactored the base machinery into abstract types and then each column implementation can bring its own dictionary to fill out how to do lookup, which was the primary difference between them.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been

#13377\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe added compression to the latest/first pair storage, but the code change was forcing new things to be persisted with the new format, meaning that any segment created with the new code cannot be read by the old code.  Instead, we need to default to creating the old format and then remove that default in a future version.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a java system property to toggle the compression on, but I do not believe we should publicly document it as it doesn't play well with the runtime.properties.  Instead, it's there just for intrepid developers who want to use the functionality/validate it ahead of the next major release.\r\n\r\nAlong with creating the tests for this, it became clear to me that various implementations of ComplexColumn were breaking contract (they were returning \"number of cells\" for a getter that is documented as returning number of bytes).  I also fixed the usages of the method that were expecting number of rows and adjusted the various implementations to return `-1` when they don't know the size.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.","created_at":"2022-11-17T02:57:28Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T16:07:03Z","closed_at":"2022-11-17T16:07:02Z","merged_at":"2022-11-17T16:07:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b9344cd39017174013f757c274e0d9c8e6671b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":606691557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDY2OTE1NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Compatibility","name":"Compatibility","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":null},{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

PR makes the following changes to the console:\r\n- The requests on native queries are now immediately canceled, this is helpful in case a user makes a very large request (without a limit) and needs to cancel the query.\r\n- The \"Query history\" dialog now avoids and does not show up for multi-stage queries because they already show up in the \"Recent query tasks\" panel and it is confusing that there are two somewhat-history-like places in the UI for multi-stage queries. Also multi-stage queries are sometimes huge and those overwhelm the localStorage.\r\n- Update DQT to fix a small

Description\r\n\r\nIn a cluster with a large number of streaming tasks (~1000), `SegmentAllocateActions` on the overlord can often take very long intervals of time to finish thus causing spikes in the `task/action/run/time`. This may result in lag building up while a task waits for a segment to get allocated.\r\n\r\nThe root causes are:\r\n- large number of metadata calls made to the segments and pending segments tables\r\n- giant lock held in `TaskLockbox.tryLock()` to acquire task locks and allocate segments\r\n\r\nSince the contention typically arises when several tasks of the same datasource try to allocate segments for the same interval/granularity, the allocation run times can be improved by batching the requests together.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Broad strokes\r\n- Add flags\r\n  - `druid.indexer.tasklock.batchSegmentAllocation` (default false)\r\n  - `druid.indexer.tasklock.batchAllocationMaxWaitTime` (in millis) (default 1000)\r\n- Put a bound on the amount of time an allocation action can take by configuring the `batchAllocationMaxWaitTime`\r\n- Add `SegmentAllocationQueue` to queue and batch allocate actions\r\n- Identify a batch uniquely with these fields\r\n  - `dataSource`\r\n  - `groupId`\r\n  - `preferredAllocationInterval`\r\n  - `skipSegmentLineageCheck`\r\n  - `useNonRootGenerationPartitionSpace` (as a proxy for `PartialShardSpec.getClass()`)\r\n  - `lockGranularity`\r\n- Metadata calls are now batched\r\n- giant lock is acquired just once per batch per tryInterval in `TaskLockbox`\r\n- Rest of the behaviour (order of steps, retries, etc.) in the new flow remains exactly the same as the old flow\r\n\r\n### Adding a request\r\n\r\n- Add methods `canPerformAsync` and `performAsync` to `TaskAction`\r\n- `performAsync` currently throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` for other action types\r\n- Submit each allocate action to a `SegmentAllocationQueue`\r\n- Add the action to a batch and execute it when it is due\r\n\r\n### Processing a request batch\r\n\r\n- Wait for `batchAllocationMaxWaitTime` before processing a batch\r\n- Send all requests in the batch to `TaskLockbox` to acquire task locks and allocate segments\r\n- Respond to leadership changes and fail items in queue when not leader\r\n- Emit batch and request level metrics\r\n\r\n### Allocating segments\r\n\r\n- Add `TaskLockbox.allocateSegments()` retaining the logic from `TaskLockbox.tryLock()`\r\n- Add `IndexerMetadataStorageCoordinator.allocatePendingSegments()` retaining the logic from `allocatePendingSegment()`\r\n\r\n### New metrics\r\n\r\nPer batch (dims: `dataSource`, `taskActionType=segmentAllocate`):\r\n\r\n- `task/action/batch/runTime`\r\n- `task/action/batch/queueTime`\r\n- `task/action/batch/size`\r\n- `task/action/batch/attempts`\r\n\r\nPer request (dims: `taskId`, `taskType`, `dataSource`, `taskActionType=segmentAllocate`):\r\n\r\n- `task/action/failed/count`\r\n- `task/action/success/count`\r\n\r\n### Pending changes\r\n\r\n- Docs for metrics\r\n- Perf eval of new flow against old flow\r\n\r\n### Further improvements\r\n\r\n- An improvement could be to free up the HTTP threads on which the request is received by using `HttpServletRequest.startAsync()`. This would allow batching of even more requests.\r\n- An improvement could be to free up the HTTP threads on which the request is received by using `HttpServletRequest.startAsync()`.\r\n- There are some metadata queries which have not been batched in this PR such as updating the acquired task lock in the metadata store and fetching a matching pending when `skipLineageCheck = false`.\r\n\r\n## Release note\r\n\r\nSpeed up segment allocation and reduce metadata calls by clubbing multiple requests together.\r\nSet `druid.indexer.tasklock.batchSegmentAllocation=true` to enable this feature.","created_at":"2022-11-15T14:35:48Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T15:49:14Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T08:30:08Z","merged_at":"2022-12-05T08:30:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"45a8fa280c1f34f0401cfa43e1d38240d7d41f91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rohangarg","id":7731512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzE1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7731512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg","html_url":"https://github.com/rohangarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohangarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design

the SuperSorter intermediate data can only be stored on locally mounted disks. Many a times, this leads to MSQ job failures due to limited local space available. To remedy this problem, we want to support composable storage for SuperSorter intermediate data which allows the data to be stored on multiple storage systems through fallbacks.\r\n\r\nTo implement composable storage for SuperSorter intermediate data, first we need to allow for using durable storage in SuperSorter's intermediate data. For that, now :  \r\n1. OutputChannelFactory can now create partitioned output channels which can comprise of multiple partitions\r\n2. The frame footer code is extracted and is being used by both local-file based storage and durable storage. It is needed to read partitions from partitioned output channels\r\n3. Durable storage connectors use a range read interface to read specific partitions\r\n4. The durable storage readable channel now supports reading frames only as well. Earlier it needed the input data to be a full frame file.\r\n\r\nFurther, now a CompositionOutputChannelFactory is created which takes in an ordered list of OutputChannelFactory. The composition factory writes/reads to/from an output channel only until the channel allows it, and transparently moves ahead to the next output channel factory in the list once the current channel reaches its limits. As of now, the composition can only be made of local storage and durable storage - in future we'd also want to allow for memory storage to be a part of the composition.\r\nThe composition factory can be enabled with the boolean context parameter : `composedIntermediateSuperSorterStorageEnabled`.\r\nAlso, to set a limit on the maximum amount of local space SuperSorter's intermediate output can take, we can set the following numeric context parameter : `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `PartitionedOutputChannel`\r\n * `PartitionedReadableFrameChannel`\r\n * `FrameFileFooter`\r\n * `DurablePartitionedReadableFrameChannel`\r\n * `ByteTracker`\r\n * `ComposingReadableFrameChannel`\r\n * `ComposingWritableFrameChannel`\r\n * `ComposingOutputChannelFactory`\r\n * `FrameFileWriter`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Along with this parameter, the user should also configure `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` to limit the amount of intermediate data being written. The recommendation is to set this ~ 70% of the disk available to an MSQ task. Finally to allow falling back to the durable storage, the durable storage feature flag and configurations should also be configured.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nSegment assignments can take very long due to the strategy cost computation for a large number of segments.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by making the segment assignments round-robin within a tier.\rOnly segment balancing takes cost-based decisions to move segments around.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n- Add dynamic config `useRoundRobinSegmentAssignment` with default value false\r\n- Add `RoundRobinServerSelector`. This does not implement the `BalancerStrategy`\r\nas it does not conform to that contract and may also be used in conjunction with a\r\nstrategy (round-robin for `RunRules` and strategy for `BalanceSegments`)\r\n- Parameterize `LoadRuleTest` to test segment loading using both regular balancer strategy\r\nand round-robin\r\n\r\n#### Changes not in this PR\r\n\r\n- Drops are still cost-based even when round-robin assignment is enabled.\r\n\r\n#### Web-console change\r\n\r\n<img width=\"251\" alt=\"round_robin\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18635897/201866429-9c5383f9-1242-4ea8-9bfe-ef33142d6c7b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nAdd a round-robin segment strategy to speed up initial segment assignments.\r\n\r\nSet `useRoundRobinSegmentAssigment` to `true` in the coordinator dynamic config to enable this feature.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nSetting up a new Druid cluster could involve tuning several runtime properties required by each service. Each process must also be given the appropriate jvm arguments so that the system can perform optimally.\r\n\r\nDruid already contains several single-server profiles such as `nano-quickstart`, `micro-quickstart`, `large-quickstart`, etc. But it is still difficult to have a setup which does not match exactly with any of these profiles. A lot of the properties in these profiles can also be commoned out and simplified.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new script `start-druid` in order to:\r\n- simplify starting any combination of Druid services on a single server\r\n- reduce the number of inputs required to start Druid\r\n- deprecate the existing profiles and eventually remove them\r\n\r\n### Usage \r\n\r\n#### Command:\r\n```bash\r\n./start-druid [--memory=totalAvailableMemory] [--services=listOfServices] [--config=rootConfigDir]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Examples:\r\n\r\n1. Run all services with total system memory and default runtime properties\r\n`./start-druid`\r\n\r\n2. Run one instance each of specific services with given total memory\r\n`./start-druid --services=broker,router,historical --memory=10g`\r\n\r\n3. Run services with overridden properties\r\n`./start-druid --services=broker,router,middleManager,historical --config=rootConfigDir`\r\nDirectory `_common` must be present inside `rootConfigDir` and must contain files `common.runtime.properties` and `common.jvm.config` with mandatory properties and any other property that you wish to override. Please refer to `conf/druid/auto/_common` for an example.\r\n  - __Override runtime properties of a service__: Specify a `runtime.properties` for that service. For the example command above, create a file  `rootConfigDir/broker/runtime.properties`. This file should contain the properties you wish to override.\r\n  - __Override jvm arguments for a service__:  To override the jvm args for any service, you must override the jvm args for _all_ the services. This is to prevent miscalculations in allocated memory. For the example command above, create directories `broker`, `router`, `middleManager`, `historical` inside the `rootConfigDir`.\r\nAdd a file `jvm.config` specifying the following values in each of the service directories.\r\n`- Xmx***`\r\n`- Xms***`\r\n`- XX:MaxDirectMemorySize***` (required only for broker and historical)\r\nFor middleManager, alongwith jvm args, you must override `druid.indexer.runner.javaOptsArray` in `rootConfigDir/middleManager/runtime.properties` \r\n\r\n### Design \r\n\r\n#### Flow\r\n- Run bash script `start-druid` with one of the possible invocations\r\n- `start-druid` invokes python script `start-druid-main.py` which computes the memory required for each service\r\n- `start-druid-main.py` invokes `bin/supervise` with the commands for each service to start.\r\n   -

For example druid cluster might be sending metrics with the statsd emitter, but we want to emit request log events to an http emitter. Currently in druid there is no way to do this without sending all the events to both of them. And each emitter doesn't necessarily have the ability to filter out events it doesn't want to send/hold onto in memory.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Create and Wire Up Switching Emitter ...\r\n\r\nWe chose to use a linear search for finding the correct emitter based on feed because the number emitters and feeds is likely to be low enough that a linear search will likely be the fastest.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

For example this means that alerts can go to http emitter, metrics can go to statsd emitter, and requestLog events can go to a kafka emitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SwitchingEmitter`\r\n * `SwitchingEmitterConfig`\r\n * `SwitchingEmitterModule`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#13332, since the underlying problem has to do with anything using `Memory` on untrusted input bytes for anything that gets instructions of where to read or write from those bytes. The reason is that `Memory` for performance reasons uses `Unsafe` for all read and write operations, even when wrapping `ByteBuffer`, so if the code tries to read out of bounds locations it can crash the jvm process and do who knows what else.\r\n\r\nI think this behavior is absolutely correct for `Memory` for most uses, but to solve our problem in a bit of an unconventional way, this PR introduces `SafeWritableMemory` and `SafeWritableBuffer` that delegate _all_ operations to an underlying plain java `ByteBuffer` so that it gets the bounds checking that goes with that, which we can use for anything that uses `Memory` when loading from an untrusted source. When reading from segments we still use standard `Memory` calls.\r\n\r\nFortunately due to a bug that wasn't fixed until #13332, i wasn't able to trigger this exact failure in older versions of Druid with the native `complex_decode_base64` expression because the complex type mapping wasn't correctly wired up to the function, but i believe it is still possible when ingesting pre-aggregated sketches that use `Memory`.\r\n\r\nTo wire up to the `complex_decode_base64` function, I've added a new method to `ObjectStrategy`, \r\n```\r\n  @Nullable\r\n  default T fromByteBufferSafe(ByteBuffer buffer, int numBytes)\r\n  {\r\n    return fromByteBuffer(buffer, numBytes);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich should be implemented by anything which uses `Unsafe` or other potentially dangerous operations. I debated having a default implementation but ultimately decided to add one since this interface is marked as an `@ExtensionPoint`. This is erring on the side of danger in favor of compatibility, so I welcome discussion here.\r\n\r\nBesides the added tests, I also did an experiment to replace all calls to `Memory.wrap` with the \"safe\" version and all of the tests passed, so I think the \"safe\" implementation of `Memory` should be correct.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nA new method has been added to the `ObjectStrategy` extension point \r\n```\r\n  @Nullable\r\n  default T fromByteBufferSafe(ByteBuffer buffer, int numBytes)\r\n  {\r\n    return fromByteBuffer(buffer, numBytes);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nto allow extension writers that implement complex types which typically use \"unsafe\" memory operations (such as using Java `Unsafe` or Datasketches `Memory`) to optionally provide a \"safe\" read method to use when processing untrusted inputs such as those decoded from base64 string inputs at ingest time and avoid bad inputs crashing the process. A default implementation is provided to be compatibility focused, but if your extension fits this description and uses unsafe memory operations, you should implement this method.

external table functions\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the first step toward catalog integration with MSQ queries: a set of refined, easier-to-use table functions.\r\n\r\n## Simplified Table Functions\r\n\r\nRecall that MSQ introduced the `extern` function:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n <column>\r\nFROM TABLE(\r\n  EXTERN(\r\n    '<Druid input source>',\r\n    '<Druid input format>',\r\n    '<row signature>'\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs explained in the [Druid Catalog Proposal](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12546), we wish to make the user experience simpler by avoiding the use of JSON. We wish to use SQL syntax instead. To do that, we must provide a solution for the input source, input format and row signature.\r\n\r\nThe `extern` function handles all input sources. The first simplification is to create functions for each supported input source. This PR introduces three:\r\n\r\n* `inline` for the `InlineInputSource` (type `\"input\"`).\r\n* `http` for the `HttpInputSource` (type `\"http\"`).\r\n* `localFiles` for the `LocalInputSource` (type `\"local\"`). (Note that the name is `localFiles` because `local` is a SQL reserved word.)\r\n\r\nSecond, we need a way to provide the various parameters for each input source. We do that with SQL named arguments. Example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nFROM TABLE(\r\n  http(\r\n    userName => 'bob',\r\n    password => 'secret',\r\n    uris => 'http:foo.com/bar.csv',\r\n    format => 'csv'\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe various input formats are defined as optional arguments. The `format` argument choose the format.\r\n\r\nFinally, we need a way to specify the schema. As it turns out, Calcite introduced the `EXTEND` clause for Apache Phoenix (though it is not clear if Phoenix ever actually used that clause.) we repurpose that clause for our needs:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nFROM TABLE(\r\n  http(\r\n    userName => 'bob',\r\n    password => 'secret',\r\n    uris => 'http:foo.com/bar.csv',\r\n    format => 'csv'\r\n    )\r\n  ) EXTEND (x VARCHAR, y VARCHAR, z BIGINT)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `EXTEND` list is simply a list of column definitions in standard SQL form.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Notes\r\n\r\nThe set of arguments available for each function is defined by the catalog \"meta-metadata\" introduced in the recent [Catalog Basics](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13165) PR. A set of \"operator conversion\" classes create SQL parameter definitions based on the property definitions of each external table type defined by the catalog. Thinking ahead, this same metadata will allow us to parameterize catalog tables in the next PR.\r\n\r\nThe `EXTEND` notation required some amount of Calcite trickery. The Calcite code expects syntax of the form:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n<TABLENAME> EXTENDS <extend-list>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, we want something of the form:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nTABLE ( <name> ( <args ) ) EXTENDS <extend-list>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe must change the parser to achieve the above. This is done via a Python script, `edit-parser.py`, which modifies the parser during the code generation phase. The parser-editing approach was taken because it is less intrusive than an approach based on copying and replacing the relevant bits of the Calcite grammar.\r\n\r\nAs set of custom extensions to Calcite classes effectively \"hides\" our usage from Calcite by passing the schema behind Calcite's back. Specifically, we rewrite the `EXTEND` node to copy the schema into a temporary operator node, then discard the `EXTEND` node so that it does not confuse Calcite.\r\n\r\nThe plumbing required for the above made it possible to cache the external table produced by the table function to avoid the normal Calcite behavior which recreates the external table multiple times during planning.\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\n\r\nRelease notes should mention the availability of the the new functions. This is not the entire set of input sources: the most important one (S3) is not yet converted. Consult the documentation included in this PR for the details.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that serialization of the `LocalInputSource` is broken: no use of this class has likely worked in practice. See [Issue #13359](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/13359) for details.\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n\r\nThe location of the generated parser in SQL changed from `target/generated-sources/annotations` to `target/generated-sources`. The Maven step in which we generate the parser changed from `initialize` to `generate-sources`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR adds `--dump nested` mode to the `dump-segment` tool, which has 2 modes for examining the internals of Druid nested columns.

Contact all tasks at once, instead of using synchronous comms in `chatThreads`. Shortens the time it takes to execute RunNotices when there are a lot of tasks. Also shortens the time for other operations that require contacting all tasks, like getting task reports.\r\n- Eliminate the need for `chatThreads`.\r\n- Reduce demands on `workerThreads`, mainly due to the restructuring of `discoverTasks`.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n1) Convert SeekableStreamIndexTaskClient to an interface, move old code\r\n   to SeekableStreamIndexTaskClientSyncImpl, and add new implementation\r\n   SeekableStreamIndexTaskClientAsyncImpl that uses ServiceClient.\r\n\r\n2) Add \"chatAsync\" parameter to seekable stream supervisors that causes\r\n   the supervisor to use an async task client.\r\n\r\n3) In SeekableStreamSupervisor.discoverTasks, adjust logic to avoid making\r\n   blocking RPC calls in workerExec threads.\r\n\r\n4) In SeekableStreamSupervisor generally, switch from Futures.successfulAsList\r\n   to FutureUtils.coalesce, so we can better capture the errors that occurred\r\n   with contacting individual tasks.\r\n\r\nOther, related changes:\r\n\r\n1) Add ServiceRetryPolicy.retryNotAvailable, which controls whether\r\n   ServiceClient retries unavailable services. Useful since we do not\r\n   want to retry calls unavailable tasks within the service client. (The\r\n   supervisor does its own higher-level retries.)\r\n\r\n2) Add FutureUtils.transformAsync, a more lambda friendly version of\r\n   Futures.transform(f, AsyncFunction).\r\n\r\n3) Add FutureUtils.coalesce. Similar to Futures.successfulAsList, but\r\n   returns Either instead of using null on error.\r\n\r\n4) Add JacksonUtils.readValue overloads for JavaType and TypeReference.","created_at":"2022-11-11T10:04:05Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T04:36:40Z","closed_at":"2022-11-21T13:50:26Z","merged_at":"2022-11-21T13:50:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfffbabb56b654ca5cd4a6b5f33c537940431f38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

To run large jobs reliably we need a way so that MSQ becomes resilient to such failures. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

If it detects a failure, it triggers a callback \r\n`RetryTask` which in turn invokes the retry function.\r\n\r\nThe retry function is also invoked if we are not able to contact the task from the controller while posting `PartitionBoundaries` and `WorkOrders`. \r\n\r\n\r\nFlow in the retry function is like this:\r\n1. GetAllTheWorkOrders which need to be retried for the worker\r\n2. Submit the worker for relaunch via  `MSQWorkerTaskLauncher`\r\n3. Add the workOrders to `workOrdersToRetry`\r\n4. In the main query kernel loop, invoke `retryFailedTasks` which checks if there are any work orders \r\n5. If yes, submit work orders once all the workers are ready to process work orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our checkpointed location is stage result output per worker, we retry the worker tasks if the stage is in \r\n* NEW\r\n* READING_INPUT\r\n* PRESHUFFLE_WAITING_FOR_RESULT_PARTITION_BOUNDARIES\r\n* PRESHUFFLE_WRITING_OUTPUT \r\n\r\nAs we need a way to retrieve outputs even if the worker dies in subsequent stages, we need the data to be in `DurableStorage` hence fault tolerance works only when `DurableStorage` is enabled. \r\n\r\n#### Guardrails\r\nAs we do not want all faults to be retired, only whitelisted error codes are retired `ControllerQueryKernel#retriableErrorCodes`\r\n\r\nWe have a max retry limit per worker set at 2.\r\nWe have a limit on total retries in a job across all workers set at 100. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

fails pretty consistently if run until failure in intelij. After adding this thread.sleep i let it run for over 2k iterations without failure.\r\n\r\nI hate it, but it seems to significantly reduce the flakiness (at least i saw no failures) and I wasn't able to determine a \"good\" fix in a short amount of time so lets do this for now.\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue appears to be a race condition with test zk server and worker startup, where if the timing is incorrect an `INITIALIZED` event that happens after the first pending task is added, can result in the task runner calling `runPendingTask`, before the test is able to call `runPendingTask`, which makes the test assertions no longer true.\r\n\r\nIn successful runs, the logs have a section like:\r\n```\r\n2022-11-03T01:20:05,937 INFO [Time-limited test]

- Adds the Jupyter notebook file `api-tutorial.ipynb`\r\n\r\nNote that the download links will 404 until this PR is merged into `master` since they reference the `raw` GitHub URL on `master`, which is

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Bump the app version in Helm Chart\r\n#### Bump the druid image version used in Helm Chart\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR.

you don't specify taskCount in your supervisor spec, it now defaults to the # of partitions you have in kinesis / kafka. This is useful for customers that are in a growth phase. Where they start with x number of partitions but then have to grow by some amount. Before you would have to update the supervisor spec and add middle managers (if needed). With the mm-less patch in druid, if a customer increased the number of partitions, all you have to do is restart the supervisor and it will pick up the new partitions.  Even if they don't grow, it is best to have one task per partition as the default (unless others oppose this). \r\n\r\nFuture work: this patch forces a manual restart of the supervisor, but no spec changes are needed, or knowledge of how many partitions your message bus has. In the future we could have a thread that detects a change and automatically restarts the supervisor, but that might be overkill.","created_at":"2022-11-09T19:26:35Z","updated_at":"2024-02-10T00:15:23Z","closed_at":"2024-02-10T00:15:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f404267b760400cdcda3a5a53e251c89e1b7e85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design

Description\r\nThis PR adds a new SQL function, `EVAL`, as a pass-through to run arbitrary native Druid expressions. The SQL type inference is fully wired up to the native expression type inference, so any native expression which correct reports its type should be able to be correctly validated in the SQL layer. The syntax is to supply the expression as a string literal and then all of the identifiers to use as input arguments following it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  EVAL('m1 + m2', m1, m2),\r\n  EVAL('concat(dim1, ''hello'', dim2)', dim1, dim2),\r\n  EVAL('to_json_string(dim1)', dim1)\r\nFROM druid.foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe input arguments are included so that the type inference can function, as it allows us to construct a map of identifier to type which can then be used to construct the native `Expr.InputBindingInspector` to run the type inference.\r\n\r\nI have elected not to document this functionality at this time because I'm not sure if we should encourage using this heavily, but it does seem like a handy tool to have available 😅 Because of this, it is disabled unless `sqlAllowEval` is set to `true` on the query context.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes `FrontCodedIndexed` 'bucketSize' handling to correctly handle bucket size of 128 by reading the bucketSize byte as unsigned, making the docs be correct about supported bucket sizes. It also adds tighter validation on the writer side, and additional tests around bucket size to make sure all allowed bucket sizes are covered with tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nFixes some bugs with the `complex_decode_base64` function, which was basically broken before this PR for a few reasons, and migrates it to being implemented as an `ExprMacro` instead of a `Function`, so that the literal arguments can be computed externally to the function instead of every evaluation. This involves a slight adjustment to `ExprMacroTable` to add the concept of built-ins to make it a bit easier to add macros.\r\n\r\nThis PR also wires `complex_decode_base64` up to SQL, previously it was only a native expression. I have purposefully still not documented this function yet to save room for future adjustments and determining the best way to position this functionality, since its use cases are currently a bit limited.\r\n\r\nThe improvements do allow some pretty funny/absurd things to work now, such as round-tripping complex types through JSON serialization and back into complex types all in the same expression as shown in one of the tests added:\r\n```\r\nSELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_BUILTIN(COMPLEX_DECODE_BASE64('hyperUnique',PARSE_JSON(TO_JSON_STRING(unique_dim1)))) from druid.foo\r\n```\r\n 😜\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nOptimize the metadata calls made to get tasks and offsets from the metadata store\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n1) Minimize the number of calls made to the db by fetching all active tasks at once and storing the result to reduce the number of individual calls made to the metadata store for each task.\r\n\r\n2) The entire set of metadata offsets was being fetched for each partition.

Description\r\nThis PR officially adds support for Parquet and Avro for Druid nested columns, including using the 'JSON' transformation functions at ingestion time. Along the way, fixes a couple of issues with using these same functions during ingest time, particularly when the top level object is a List/Array instead of an object. This particular code area was a bit obsolete, expecting only the primitive Druid ARRAY types to be handled, but that is no longer true after the introduction of nested arrays and complex expression types (e.g. arrays of complex types). I've expanded this code area to fall back on using `ExprEval.bestEffortOf` to determine the type of the array. This isn't actually specific to Parquet or Avro, these errors could occur with JSON and potentially any other nested list input values intended to be used in expressions.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nDruid nested columns now support Parquet and Avro input formats, either to ingest directly into nested columns, or using the 'JSON' expressions as transforms, such as `JSON_VALUE` and `JSON_QUERY`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n`cachingCost` strategy has some discrepancies when compared to cost strategy.\r\nThis PR addresses two of these by retaining the same behaviour as the `cost` strategy\r\nwhen computing the cost of moving a segment to a server:\r\n- subtract the self cost of a segment if it is being served by the target server\r\n- subtract the cost of segments that are marked to be dropped\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Add tests to verify fixed strategy. These tests would fail without the fixes made to `CachingCostStrategy.computeCost()`\r\n- Fix the definition of the segment related metrics in the docs.\r\n- Fix some docs issues introduced in #13181 \r\n   - Remove word `autokill` from docs as it caused spellcheck failure and use alternate\r\n   phrasing since `autokill` is not used anywhere else in the docs.\r\n   - Fix links\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix balancing issues with `cachingCost` balancer strategy.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes flaky testResumeAllActivelyReadingTasks (https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/13289)\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

fetch of pending segments happens behind a lock and can cause others threads to remain stuck while deserializing the payload fetched from the metadata store.\r\n\r\nThe query to fetch the payload uses a `<=` and `>=` on the start and end intervals. \r\n```\r\nSELECT payload FROM pending_segments \r\nWHERE datasource = 'search-ds'\r\nAND start <= 'search-end-time'\r\nAND end >= 'search-start-time'\r\n```\r\nThis might often end up fetching more segments than would actually have an overlap.\r\nFor example, when searching for the interval `10am to 11am`, a segment with interval \r\n`9am to 10am` would also satisfy this query.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstart <= search-end AND end >= search-start\r\n9 <= 11 AND 10 >= 10\r\n```\r\nBut in reality, the interval `9am to 10am` doesn't have any overlap with our search interval `10am to 11am`.\r\nThis is because the end time of a segment interval is always exclusive.\r\n\r\nSuch results eventually get filtered out by the check on interval `interval.overlaps(identifier.getInterval())`\r\nbut only after the costly deserialization.\r\n\r\n__Changes:__\r\n- Improve select query to fetch only segments that can overlap. \r\n   Use the same condition as present in Interval.overlaps\r\n\r\n__Notes:__\r\nThis query (and also the original query) can give incorrect results in cases where a string comparison\r\nof the two intervals is not feasible, typically if the search year and interval year are far apart.\r\nSee #11582 for a related fix.\r\nA long-term fix for this could be to migrate these timestamps to use longs rather than varchars.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug with `FrontCodedIndexed` when containing only a single null value. Because the null value is not actually stored in the \"value buckets\", it can result in a null pointer exception in `FrontCodedIndexedWriter` when serializing the column, and a buffer underflow in `FrontCodedIndexed` when creating an iterator on a `FrontCodedIndexed` with only a null value, since the values section is actually empty.\r\n\r\nI also added bounds checking to the `get` method of `FrontCodedIndexed` as a safety measure, which if everything is written correctly shouldn't be needed, but also doesn't seem to add much performance impact so it seems worth the sanity checks it provides in the event \r\n```\r\nBenchmark              (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (storageType)  (stringEncoding)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt      Score     Error  Units\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       23           5000000           mmap              none        false  avgt    5  11256.550 ±  43.827  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       23           5000000           mmap              none        force  avgt    5  11255.502 ±  29.165  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       23           5000000           mmap     front-coded-4        false  avgt    5  11978.854 ±  27.574  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       23           5000000           mmap     front-coded-4        force  avgt    5  12724.125 ±  85.407  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       23           5000000           mmap    front-coded-16        false  avgt    5  13319.569 ±  41.002  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       23           5000000           mmap    front-coded-16        force  avgt    5  13300.229 ±  58.178  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000           mmap              none        false  avgt    5     24.458 ±   0.771  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000           mmap              none        force  avgt    5     20.168 ±   0.615  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000           mmap     front-coded-4        false  avgt    5     24.781 ±   0.720  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000           mmap     front-coded-4        force  avgt    5     20.343 ±   0.666  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000           mmap    front-coded-16        false  avgt    5     24.626 ±   0.792  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000           mmap    front-coded-16        force  avgt    5     20.578 ±   0.666  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000           mmap              none        false  avgt    5    407.870 ±   4.176  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000           mmap              none        force  avgt    5    245.788 ±   1.136  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000           mmap     front-coded-4        false  avgt    5    416.001 ±   5.973  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000           mmap     front-coded-4        force  avgt    5    248.944 ±   8.933  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000           mmap    front-coded-16        false  avgt    5    419.480 ±   7.841  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000           mmap    front-coded-16        force  avgt    5    256.627 ±   4.642  ms/op\r\n```\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to add some missing information to the MSQ error codes section. It might be easiest to review the four (in the mean time more, but all very small) commits individually (to distinguish white-space changes from actual content).\r\n\r\n#### Missing Additional Fields\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the [MSQ error codes documentation](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/multi-stage-query/reference.html#error-codes), I noticed that a few fields were missing in the `additionalFields` section for a few error faults.\r\n\r\nI compared them to the latest sources in `master` and tried to update the reference accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Minor typo\r\n\r\n`umInputFiles` -> `numInputFiles`\r\n\r\n#### Whitespace / Markdown\r\n\r\nIn addition, I cleaned up a bunch of whitespace in the markdown file and added one missing language identifier to a code block to hopefully improve syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
