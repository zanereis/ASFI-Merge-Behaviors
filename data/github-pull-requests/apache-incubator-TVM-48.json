In particular, it must undo both the\r\n'partitioning' (ie separating out the \"Compiler\" function) and any 'compositing' (ie separating\r\nout small sub-graphs as \"Composite\" functions).\r\n\r\nFix misspelled nn.bias_add while there.\r\n\r\nNote that the current implementation has been broken since #11203 (mea culpa) but was untested by CI. I have all the tests fixed in a follow-up PR and a few other bug fixes.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-27T19:04:59Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T23:04:50Z","closed_at":"2022-06-27T22:48:47Z","merged_at":"2022-06-27T22:48:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"62b21a18a8bf3b34d6a7ee7d91b6a2f957946087","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/862e0e147023f469797adc9e11185584ac561dcb","head":{"label":"mbs-octoml:mbs-prep-for-trt2","ref":"mbs-prep-for-trt2","sha":"862e0e147023f469797adc9e11185584ac561dcb","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":386444680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODY0NDQ2ODA=","name":"mbs-tvm","full_name":"mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","description":"Open

code was there to stop Jenkins restarts from doing a repository\nscan and scheduling a ton of builds. However, I haven't noticed this\nhappening during restarts lately, and repository scans are useful to\npatch up PRs that didn't get CI run properly (i.e. while Jenkins was\ndown or something).\n\nFor example in #11914 since this code is there all the messed up PRs\nneeded their CI to be manually re-triggered even though they were\ndetected during the scan.\n\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

PR adds support for Onnx sequence operators introduced in opset 11. Specifically I've added converters for `SequenceConstruct`, `SequenceInsert`, and `ConcatFromSequence`, which we found sometimes show up in models exported from Pytorch. For simplicity, I handle these cases by just using Tuples. We may want to consider using the TensorArray ADT eventually

retraining is a time consuming part for MetaSchedule tuning, similar to AutoScheduler, we can alleviate it with an adapative way of increasing waiting period between each retraining. This PR introduced an argument called `adpative_training` in `TuneConfig` and the constructor of `XGBoostModel` to enable the capability. Testing tuning scripts are also updated.","created_at":"2022-06-24T19:57:22Z","updated_at":"2022-06-28T18:04:14Z","closed_at":"2022-06-28T18:04:14Z","merged_at":"2022-06-28T18:04:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e23122846aa3b7a5350102d8c06fa21695d34be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11892/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11892/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11892/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0ee2661312299119a6b1ce7eab1e388f1558aa52","head":{"label":"zxybazh:feature/2022-06-24/apative-training-cost-model","ref":"feature/2022-06-24/apative-training-cost-model","sha":"0ee2661312299119a6b1ce7eab1e388f1558aa52","user":{"login":"zxybazh","id":3203174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh","html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":337237632,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzcyMzc2MzI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"zxybazh/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zxybazh","id":3203174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh","html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh/tvm","description":"Open

in `ConstIntBoundAnalyzer`, entering a conditional such as `if 2==0` could result in the expression `2` being treated as having a known value of zero within the body of the conditional.  Evaluating the range of expressions using `2` in the body of the conditional could result in exceptions being thrown, such as evaluating `expr / 2` while setting `2` to its maximum value of zero.\r\n\r\nThis issue was present for conditions with inequalities for some time, but was introduced for conditions with equalities in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11524.

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.22.0</h2>\n<h1>NumPy 1.22.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>NumPy 1.22.0 is a big release featuring the work of 153 contributors\nspread over 609 pull requests. There have been many improvements,\nhighlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The\nnew methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in\nthe literature.</li>\n<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for\ncommonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7\nhas been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python\n3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of\nUbuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.\nAll 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix\nthe occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,\nand <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539\">gh-19539</a>)</p>\n<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>\n<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that\nusers use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both\ndeprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with\nthe appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19615\">gh-19615</a>)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.22.0</h2>\n<h1>NumPy 1.22.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>NumPy 1.22.0 is a big release featuring the work of 153 contributors\nspread over 609 pull requests. There have been many improvements,\nhighlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The\nnew methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in\nthe literature.</li>\n<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for\ncommonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7\nhas been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python\n3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of\nUbuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.\nAll 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix\nthe occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,\nand <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539\">gh-19539</a>)</p>\n<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>\n<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that\nusers use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both\ndeprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with\nthe appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19615\">gh-19615</a>)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
