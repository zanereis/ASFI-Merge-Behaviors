What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSimilar to `LeastSquaresAggregator` in #14109, `AFTAggregator` used for `AFTSurvivalRegression` ends up serializing the `parameters` and `featuresStd`, which is not necessary and can cause performance issues for high dimensional data. This patch removes this serialization. This PR is highly inspired by #14109.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI tested this locally and verified the serialization reduction. \n\nBefore

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor ORC source, Spark SQL has a writer option `compression`, which is used to set the codec and its value will be also set to `orc.compress` (the orc conf used for codec). However, if a user only set `orc.compress` in the writer option, we should not use the default value of `compression` (snappy) as the codec. Instead, we should respect the value of `orc.compress`.\n\nThis PR makes ORC data source not ignoring `orc.compress` when `comperssion` is unset.\n\nSo, here is the behaviour,\n1. Check `compression` and use this if it is set.\n2. If `compression` is not set, check `orc.compress` and use it.\n3. If `compression` and `orc.compress` are not set, then use the default snappy.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test in `OrcQuerySuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-08-06T02:14:21Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:39:46Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T02:25:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"242b8b6f27ccac9540c16cf01d43cb821d361892","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4d6999ca610ca7f3d0994c312c8821d5433aa83","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16610","ref":"SPARK-16610","sha":"e4d6999ca610ca7f3d0994c312c8821d5433aa83","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the programming guide, the accumulator section mixes up both the old and new APIs causing it to be confusing.  This is not necessary for Scala, so all references to the old API are removed.  For Java, it is somewhat fixed up except for the example of a custom accumulator because I don't think an API exists yet.  Python has not currently implemented the new API.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nbuilt doc locally\n","created_at":"2016-08-05T22:50:53Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T01:00:52Z","closed_at":"2016-08-07T08:08:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9cf378197827cd6c697637301884ff75ea18f22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14516/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14516/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14516/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fcf34bab10b4c52e49556ffe37dc7c75123b6973","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:fixup-accumulator-programming-guide-SPARK-15702","ref":"fixup-accumulator-programming-guide-SPARK-15702","sha":"fcf34bab10b4c52e49556ffe37dc7c75123b6973","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis removes partition columns from column metadata of partitions to match tables.\n\nA change introduced in SPARK-14388 removed partition columns from the column metadata of tables, but not for partitions. This causes TableReader to believe that the schema is different between table and partition, and create an unnecessary conversion object inspector in TableReader.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn both `OnHeapColumnVector` and `OffHeapColumnVector`, we implemented `getInt()` with the following code pattern:\n\n```\npublic int getInt(int rowId) {\nif (dictionary == null)\n{ return intData[rowId]; }\nelse\n{ return dictionary.decodeToInt(dictionaryIds.getInt(rowId)); }\n}\n```\n\nAs `dictionaryIds` is also a `ColumnVector`, this results in a recursive call of `getInt()` and breaks JIT inlining. As a result, `getInt()` will not get inlined.\n\nWe fix this by adding a separate method `getDictId()` specific for `dictionaryIds` to use. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWe tested the difference with the following aggregate query on a TPCDS dataset (with scale factor = 5):\n\n```\nselect\n  max(ss_sold_date_sk) as max_ss_sold_date_sk,\nfrom store_sales\n```\n\nThe query runtime is improved, from 202ms (before) to 159ms (after).\n","created_at":"2016-08-05T22:16:58Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T21:47:05Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T21:47:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ba6a2e61ed39f613096cc8a825a493321282d7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b8f254987b4e0f09d7b3e0f080a340238ac2e088","head":{"label":"ooq:SPARK-16928","ref":"SPARK-16928","sha":"b8f254987b4e0f09d7b3e0f080a340238ac2e088","user":{"login":"ooq","id":5876435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq","html_url":"https://github.com/ooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44266813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDI2NjgxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ooq/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ooq","id":5876435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq","html_url":"https://github.com/ooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ooq/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes a bug in Spark's standalone Master which could cause applications to hang if tasks cause executors to exit with zero exit codes.\n\nAs an example of the bug, run\n\n```\nsc.parallelize(1 to 1, 1).foreachPartition { _ => System.exit(0) }\n```\n\non a standalone cluster which has a single Spark application. This will cause all executors to die but those executors won't be replaced unless another Spark application or worker joins or leaves the cluster (or if an executor exits with a non-zero exit code). This behavior is caused by a bug in how the Master handles the `ExecutorStateChanged` event: the current implementation calls `schedule()` only if the executor exited with a non-zero exit code, so a task which causes a JVM to unexpectedly exit \"cleanly\" will skip the `schedule()` call.\n\nThis patch addresses this by modifying the `ExecutorStateChanged` to always unconditionally call `schedule()`. This should be safe because it should always be safe to call `schedule()`; adding extra `schedule()` calls can only affect performance and should not introduce correctness bugs.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added a regression test in `DistributedSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-08-05T21:15:06Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T02:41:06Z","closed_at":"2016-08-07T02:31:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10bd2e420d4f895916b0b17f61607d53b621a4a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c567a7e0f612a31df9197a07206a5dea8f45d1f5","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-16925","ref":"SPARK-16925","sha":"c567a7e0f612a31df9197a07206a5dea8f45d1f5","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe issue is that `DataSource.sourceSchema()` has a check against only the SQLConf setting `spark.sql.streaming.schemaInference`, which is only set at the Session level. So even though the user specify `option(\"inferSchema\", true)` as they would usually do for `DataFrameReader` for csv/json file, DataSource.sourceSchema() does not know. and this option is not passed down to `CSVFileFormat.inferSchema`.\n\nThis PR is to combine the checking of both the value of `spark.sql.streaming.schemaInference` and the `option(\"inferSchema\")`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew unit test added to test creating streaming DataSet with `option(\"inferSchema\", true)`\nAnd ran the regression buckets.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nMSCK REPAIR TABLE could be used to recover the partitions in external catalog based on partitions in file system.\n\nAnother syntax is: ALTER TABLE

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Hive built-in `hash` function is not being used in Spark since Spark 2.0. The public interface does not allow users to unregister the Spark built-in functions. Thus, users will never use Hive's built-in `hash` function. \r\n\r\nThe only exception here is `TestHiveFunctionRegistry`, which allows users to unregister the built-in functions. Thus, we can load Hive's hash function in the test cases. If we disable it, 10+ test cases will fail because the results are different from the Hive golden answer files.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to remove `hash` from the list of `hiveFunctions` in `HiveSessionCatalog`. It will also remove `TestHiveFunctionRegistry`. This removal makes us easier to remove `TestHiveSessionState` in the future.\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we create the HiveConf for metastore client, we use a Hadoop Conf as the base, which may contain Hive settings in hive-site.xml (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/internal/SharedState.scala#L49). However, HiveConf's initialize function basically ignores the base Hadoop Conf and always its default values (i.e. settings with non-null default values) as the base (https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-1.2.1/common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/conf/HiveConf.java#L2687). So, even a user put javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL in hive-site.xml, it is not used and Hive will use its default, which is jdbc:derby:;databaseName=metastore_db;create=true.\n\nThis issue only shows up when `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` is not set to builtin.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test in

Proposed Changes\n- Update the list of \"important classes\" in `pyspark.sql` to match 2.0.\n- Fix references to `UDFRegistration` so that the class shows up in the docs. It currently [doesn't](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html).\n- Remove some unnecessary whitespace in the Python RST doc files.\n\nI reused the [existing JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16772) I created last week for similar API doc fixes.\n## How was this patch tested?\n- I ran `lint-python` successfully.\n- I ran `make clean build`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds both rules for preventing to use `@Deprecated` and `@Override`.\n- Java's `@Override`\n  It seems Scala compiler just ignores this. Apparently, `override` modifier is only mandatory for \" that override some other **concrete member definition** in a parent class\" but not for for **incomplete member definition** (such as ones from trait or abstract), see (http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/05-classes-and-objects.html#override)\n  \n  For a simple example,\n  - Normal class - needs `override` modifier\n  \n  ``` bash\n  scala> class A { def say = {}}\n  defined class A\n  \n  scala> class B extends A { def say = {}}\n  <console>:8: error: overriding method say in class A of type => Unit;\n  method say needs `override' modifier\n       class B extends A { def say = {}}\n                               ^\n  ```\n  - Trait - does not need `override` modifier\n  \n  ``` bash\n  scala> trait A { def say }\n  defined trait A\n  \n  scala> class B extends A { def say = {}}\n  defined class B\n  ```\n  \n  To cut this short, this case below is possible,\n  \n  ``` bash\n  scala> class B extends A { \n       |    @Override\n       |    def say = {}\n       | }\n  defined class B\n  ```\n  \n  we can write `@Override` annotation (meaning nothing) which might confuse engineers that Java's annotation is working fine. It might be great if we prevent those potential confusion.\n- Java's `@Deprecated`\n  When `@Deprecated` is used,  it seems Scala compiler recognises this correctly but it seems we use Scala one `@deprecated` across codebase.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested, by inserting both `@Override` and `@Deprecated`. This will shows the error messages as below:\n\n``` bash\nScalastyle checks failed at following occurrences:\n[error] ... : @deprecated should be used instead of @java.lang.Deprecated.\n```\n\n``` basg\nScalastyle checks failed at following occurrences:\n[error] ... : override modifier should be used instead of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe java.net.URL class has a globally synchronized Hashtable, which limits the throughput of any single executor doing lots of calls to parse_url(). Tests have shown that a 36-core machine can only get to 10% CPU use because the threads are locked most of the time.\n\nThis patch switches to java.net.URI which has less features than java.net.URL but focuses on URI parsing, which is enough for parse_url().\n\nNew tests were added to make sure a few common edge cases didn't change behaviour.\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16826\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI've kept the old URL code commented for now, so that people can verify that the new unit tests do pass with java.net.URL.\n\nThanks to @srowen for the help!\n","created_at":"2016-08-04T00:08:46Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T20:30:59Z","closed_at":"2016-08-05T19:57:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31dcb6d02ab6bab4bbda0aa4832567d37bc10085","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ff8200714cc919ac99b681c4e452640e5936a71","head":{"label":"sylvinus:master","ref":"master","sha":"4ff8200714cc919ac99b681c4e452640e5936a71","user":{"login":"sylvinus","id":410452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDQ1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/410452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus","html_url":"https://github.com/sylvinus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64251416,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDI1MTQxNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sylvinus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sylvinus","id":410452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDQ1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/410452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus","html_url":"https://github.com/sylvinus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvinus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sylvinus/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16862\n\n`BufferedInputStream` used in `UnsafeSorterSpillReader` uses the default 8k buffer to read data off disk. This PR makes it configurable to improve on disk reads. I have kept the default value to be same as it was before (8k) so there would not be any change in current behavior.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI am relying on the existing unit tests.\n## Performance\n\nAfter deploying this change to prod and setting the config to 1 mb, there was a 12% reduction in the CPU time and 19.5% reduction in CPU reservation time.\n","created_at":"2016-08-03T03:20:21Z","updated_at":"2016-08-20T05:27:07Z","closed_at":"2016-08-20T03:17:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4baa95ce8d5a22a763f9a380fe90bbe74c347475","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14475/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14475/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14475/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/950bb21d1f8f3e98b6a8ef00606c9b6c3e30f659","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:spill_buffer","ref":"spill_buffer","sha":"950bb21d1f8f3e98b6a8ef00606c9b6c3e30f659","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch introduces SQLQueryTestSuite, a basic framework for end-to-end SQL test cases defined in spark/sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests. This is a more standard way to test SQL queries end-to-end in different open source database systems, because it is more manageable to work with files.\n\nThis is inspired by HiveCompatibilitySuite, but simplified for general Spark SQL tests. Once this is merged, I can work towards porting SQLQuerySuite over, and eventually also move the existing HiveCompatibilitySuite to use this framework.\n\nUnlike HiveCompatibilitySuite, SQLQueryTestSuite compares both the output schema and the output data (in string form).\n\nWhen there is a mismatch, the error message looks like the following:\n\n```\n[info] - blacklist.sql !!! IGNORED !!!\n[info] - number-format.sql *** FAILED *** (2 seconds, 405 milliseconds)\n[info]   Expected \"...147483648 -214748364[8]\", but got \"...147483648   -214748364[9]\" Result should match for query #1 (SQLQueryTestSuite.scala:171)\n[info]   org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException:\n[info]   at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:495)\n[info]   at org.scalatest.FunSuite.newAssertionFailedException(FunSuite.scala:1555)\n[info]   at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.assertResult(Assertions.scala:1171)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a test infrastructure

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR improves ORCFileFormat to handle cases when schema stored in the ORC file does not match the schema stored in metastore. \n\nORC Data written by Hive-1.x had virtual column names (HIVE-4243). This is fixed in Hive-2.x, but for data stored using Hive-1.x spark would throw exceptions. To mitigate this, \"spark.sql.hve.convertMetastoreOrc\" was disabled via SPARK-15705.  However, that would incur\nperformance penalties as it would go via HiveTableScan and HadoopRDD.  This PR fixes this issue.\n\nRelated tickets:\nSPARK-15705 : Change the default value of spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreOrc to false.\nSPARK-15705 : Spark won't read ORC schema from metastore for partitioned tables\nSPARK-16628 : OrcConversions should not convert an ORC table represented by MetastoreRelation to HadoopFsRelation if metastore schema does not match schema stored in ORC files\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing by setting \"spark.sql.hve.convertMetastoreOrc=true\" and querying data stored via Hive-1.x in ORC format. Also ran unit-tests related to sql.\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\n","created_at":"2016-08-03T02:25:40Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T09:00:46Z","closed_at":"2017-11-07T09:00:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe038c6843c4c41b528e055bffdc0b179cdb2756","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/046e0c433997b71c85635535b5039e0405cabd13","head":{"label":"rajeshbalamohan:SPARK-14387.2","ref":"SPARK-14387.2","sha":"046e0c433997b71c85635535b5039e0405cabd13","user":{"login":"rajeshbalamohan","id":323339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzMzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan","html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49923428,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTkyMzQyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rajeshbalamohan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rajeshbalamohan","id":323339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzMzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan","html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn 2.0, we verify the data type against schema for every row for safety, but with performance cost, this PR make it optional. \n\nWhen we verify the data type for StructType, it does not support all the types we support in infer schema (for example, dict), this PR fix that to make them consistent.\n\nFor Row object which is created using named

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is follow-up for #14378. When we add `transformSchema` for all estimators and transformers, I found there are tests failed for `StringIndexer` and `VectorAssembler`. So I moved these parts of work separately in this PR, to make it more clear to review.\nThe corresponding tests should throw `IllegalArgumentException` at schema validation period after we add `transformSchema`. It's efficient that to throw exception at the start of `fit` or `transform` rather than during the process.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nModified unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-08-02T07:44:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-06T09:06:45Z","closed_at":"2016-08-05T21:09:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"206fc4996facd9fb654e47f2f310808264efbb9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9dee09e70ab54d074261b93b8e364cf30ba97d59","head":{"label":"yanboliang:transformSchema","ref":"transformSchema","sha":"9dee09e70ab54d074261b93b8e364cf30ba97d59","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix the typo of `TreeEnsembleModels` for PySpark, it should `TreeEnsembleModel` which will be consistent with Scala. What's more, it represents a tree ensemble model, so  `TreeEnsembleModel` should be more reasonable. This should not be used public, so it will not involve  breaking change.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo new tests, should pass existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDesign doc: https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12845016/de-duplicating%20subqueries.pdf\r\n\r\nThe subqueries in SparkSQL will be run even they have the same physical plan and output same results. We should be able to deduplicate these subqueries which are referred in a query for many times.\r\n\r\nThis change is motivated by the attempt to improve the performance of CTE subqueries. However, it is not limited to CTE but can be applied to other subqueries in general. Note that because CTE provides the scope information, we can better utilize it to find common subqueries among the whole query plan.\r\n\r\nFor the other subqueries, we rely on `sameResult` to decide if two subqueries are the same common subquery. As we know, `sameResult` doesn't guarantee to determine two given plans will produce the same results, so it is possibly two non-CTE subqueries which produce the same results are not considered as common subquery.\r\n### Compared to existing result reusing rule ReuseExchange\r\n\r\nThe planning rule `ReuseExchange` can find out duplicated exchanges in the spark plan and reuse the same exchange for all the references. So we already have it to reuse Broadcast and Shuffle. Why do we need this PR to reuse duplicated subqueries?\r\n\r\nThe mean we rely on to find the duplicated exchanges is `sameResult`. Quoted from its comments:\r\n\r\n> Since its likely undecidable to generally determine if two given plans will produce the same results, it is okay for this function to return false, even if the results are actually the same.\r\n\r\nThat's said, for some cases (if not most cases), the query plan can't meet the requirement of `sameResult` to reuse Shuffle or Broadcast, even the two plans are actually producing the same results. That is what we observed when benchmarking on TPC-DS queries.\r\n\r\nHowever, CTE subqueries provide the good scope information (i.e., the subquery alias) we can utilize to find duplicated query plans. E.g., for a query like:\r\n\r\nWITH cte AS (SELECT \\* FROM src) SELECT \\* FROM cte a JOIN cte b\r\n\r\nIt is guaranteed that `a` and `b` are the same, and we can reuse the same result.\r\n\r\nBesides, there are operators and situations which don't involve Exchange and we still need to de-duplicate the same subqueries.\r\n### Eliminating SubqueryAlias\r\n\r\nPreviously, we eliminate all `SubqueryAlias` at the beginning of `Optimizer`. Now it is changed to only eliminate the `SubqueryAlias` which is only referred once in the whole query plan. This is performed by the new `EliminateOneTimeSubqueryAliases`.\r\n### De-duplicate common SubqueryAlias\r\n\r\nAnother new rule `DedupCommonSubqueries` is introduced to de-duplicate common subqueries before optimization.\r\n\r\nEach `SubqueryAlias` has a child logical plan representing the subquery. We generate the executed plan for the logical plan and attach it to a  `CommonSubquery` operator which is just a wrapper for the executed plan.\r\n\r\nNote that we will search if any same logical plan exists. So for any distinct subquery logical plan, we will have only one executed plan shared between many `CommonSubquery`. Once the executed plan is executed, its result will be kept and shared between these `CommonSubquery` too.\r\n\r\nNote that we will only keep the common subqueries at the highest level in the query. That is said we will strip the common subqueries wrapped in other common subquery. That will simplify the logic to optimize filter/projection pushdown between such nested common subqueries. And the common subquery at the highest level should be the most expensive one to de-duplicate.\r\n### Modifying sameResult of SubqueryAlias\r\n\r\nThis PR override the default `sameResult` method in `SubqueryAlias`. If two `SubqueryAlias` have the child logical plans generating the same results, the `sameResult` on them should return `true`.\r\n### Optimization regarding common subqueries and operators on them\r\n\r\nIt is possibly that we have a logical plan including a common subquery like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJoin\r\n  Filter [year = 2000]\r\n    SubqueryAlias a\r\n      ...\r\n  Filter [year = 2001]\r\n    SubqueryAlias b\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptimization rules that push down `Filter` would work for it because the additional `SubqueryAlias`. We know `Filter` and `Project` pushdown can improve the query performance a lot. So we introduce a new optimization rule `OptimizeCommonSubqueries`.\r\n\r\nSimply said, the rule finds the common subqueries. For each common subquery, we optimize all subqueries producing the same results with the operator on them. We consider two cases. First, all subqueries have a `Project` on them. Second, all subqueries have a `Filter` on them.\r\n\r\nFor Project pushdown, we concatenate all project lists and push down it to all subqueries. For Filter pushdown, we concatenate all filtering conditions with a `Or` expression and push down it to all subqueries. For example, the above query plan would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJoin\r\n  Filter [year = 2000]\r\n    SubqueryAlias a\r\n      Filter [year = 2000 or year = 2001]\r\n      ...\r\n  Filter [year = 2001]\r\n    SubqueryAlias b\r\n      Filter [year = 2000 or year = 2001]\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the two subqueries have the same filter operator pushed down. So they are still common subqueries and the results can be reused.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis problem was found in [PARQUET-251](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-251) and we disabled filter pushdown on binary columns in Spark before. We enabled this after upgrading Parquet but it seems there is potential incompatibility for Parquet files written in lower Spark versions.\n\nCurrently, this does not happen in normal Parquet reader. However, In Spark, we implemented a vectorized reader, separately with Parquet's standard API. For normal Parquet reader this is being handled but not in the vectorized reader.\n\nIt is okay to just pass `FileMetaData`. This is being handled in parquet-mr (See https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/commit/e3b95020f777eb5e0651977f654c1662e3ea1f29). This will prevent loading corrupt statistics in each page in Parquet.\n\nThis PR replaces the deprecated usage of constructor.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A\n","created_at":"2016-08-02T04:40:46Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:39:49Z","closed_at":"2016-08-06T03:42:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8fb853a1ff05d59ee86f6d695a5e463c60206cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50cc80c8c63f2cbf87d0898f8d4b30c724336e2c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16847","ref":"SPARK-16847","sha":"50cc80c8c63f2cbf87d0898f8d4b30c724336e2c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd an `install.spark` function to the SparkR package. User can run `install.spark()` to install Spark to a local directory within R if no existing one found.\n\nIt tries to search for installation files in three ways, in the following order.\n1. user provided mirror site in `mirrorUrl`\n2. mirror site suggested from apache website\n3. hardcoded backup option\n\nIf the user calls `sparkR.session()` and no spark package found, it will install automatically.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen reading from Parquet table, Spark updates row level metrics like recordsRead, bytesRead.\nThe implementation is not very efficient. It may take 20% of read them to update these metrics.\n\nTest benchmark:\n\n```\n// Generates parquet table with nested columns\nspark.range(100000000).select(struct($\"id\").as(\"nc\")).write.parquet(\"/tmp/data4\")\n\ndef time[R](block: => R): Long = {\n    val t0 = System.nanoTime()\n    val result = block    // call-by-name\n    val t1 = System.nanoTime()\n    println(\"Elapsed time: \" + (t1 - t0)/1000000 + \"ms\")\n    (t1 - t0)/1000000\n}\n\nval x = ((0 until 20).toList.map(x => time(spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/data4\").filter($\"nc.id\" < 100).collect()))).sum/20\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisiting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor non-partitioned parquet table, if the vectorized parquet record reader is not being used, Spark 2.0 adds an extra unnecessary memory copy to append partition values for each row.\n\nThere are several typical cases that vectorized parquet record reader is not being used:\n1. When the table schema is not flat, like containing nested fields.\n2. When `spark.sql.parquet.enableVectorizedReader = false`\n\nBy fixing this bug, we get about 20% - 30% performance gain in test case like this:\n\n```\n// Generates parquet table with nested columns\nspark.range(100000000).select(struct($\"id\").as(\"nc\")).write.parquet(\"/tmp/data4\")\n\ndef time[R](block: => R): Long = {\n    val t0 = System.nanoTime()\n    val result = block    // call-by-name\n    val t1 = System.nanoTime()\n    println(\"Elapsed time: \" + (t1 - t0)/1000000 + \"ms\")\n    (t1 - t0)/1000000\n}\n\nval x = ((0 until 20).toList.map(x => time(spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/data4\").filter($\"nc.id\" < 100).collect()))).sum/20\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAfter a few times warm up, we get 26% performance improvement\n\nBefore fix: \n\n```\nAverage: 4584ms, raw data (10 tries): 4726ms 4509ms 4454ms 4879ms 4586ms 4733ms 4500ms 4361ms 4456ms 4640ms\n```\n\nAfter fix: \n\n```\nAverage: 3614ms, raw data(10 tries): 3554ms 3740ms 4019ms 3439ms 3460ms 3664ms 3557ms 3584ms 3612ms 3531ms\n```\n\nTest env: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, Intel SSD

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimplify struct creation, especially the aspect of `CleanupAliases` which missed some aliases when handling trees created by `CreateStruct`.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n\r\n1. A failing test (create struct with nested aliases, some of the aliases survive `CleanupAliases`).\r\n2. A fix that transforms `CreateStruct` into a `CreateNamedStruct` constructor, effectively eliminating `CreateStruct` from all expression trees.\r\n3. A `NamePlaceHolder` used by `CreateStruct` when column names cannot be extracted from unresolved `NamedExpression`.\r\n4. A new Analyzer rule that resolves `NamePlaceHolder` into a string literal once the `NamedExpression` is resolved.\r\n5. `CleanupAliases` code was simplified as it no longer has to deal with `CreateStruct`'s top level columns.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nrunning all tests-suits in package org.apache.spark.sql, especially including the analysis suite, making sure added test initially fails, after applying suggested fix rerun the entire analysis package successfully.\r\n\r\nmodified few tests that expected `CreateStruct` which is now transformed into `CreateNamedStruct`.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to @hvanhovell for assisting with this PR.","created_at":"2016-08-01T22:13:06Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T01:54:20Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T16:16:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1bb02c4f54ee443f7204e99ff0f32b4abe21e816","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9b89e315f83a792d62d02d56f46448d339a705e8","head":{"label":"eyalfa:SPARK-16839_redundant_aliases_after_cleanupAliases","ref":"SPARK-16839_redundant_aliases_after_cleanupAliases","sha":"9b89e315f83a792d62d02d56f46448d339a705e8","user":{"login":"eyalfa","id":1131833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE4MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1131833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa","html_url":"https://github.com/eyalfa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64462239,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDQ2MjIzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"eyalfa/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eyalfa","id":1131833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE4MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1131833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa","html_url":"https://github.com/eyalfa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eyalfa/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is a part of [SPARK-16576](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16576) that moves logicalPlan SQL generation code from SQLBuilder into logical operators.\n\nLike `Expression`, this PR adds `sql` function for `LogicalPlan` and `NonSQLPlan` trait. The method will be `abstract` method. All logical plan should implement that or use trait `NonSQLPlan` explicitly.\n\n``` scala\n/**\n * Returns SQL representation of this plan. For the plans extending [[NonSQLPlan]],\n * this method may return an arbitrary user facing string.\n */\ndef sql: String\n```\n\nThis PR updates testsuites including`LogicalPlanToSQLSuite` and `ExpressionToSQLSuite` in order to test new `sql` function, but does not remove `SQLBuilder` and its usage in `views.scala` of `sql/core`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe following pull request addresses the new feature request described in SPARK-16258.\nIt automatically('by default') appends grouping keys to output `DataFrame`.\n\nI've also tried to solve the problem by adding an optional flag in `gapply` that states if the key is required or not. However, the optional flag needs to be passed as an argument through a number of methods which is not necessarily elegant and leads to some issues such as \"The number of parameters should not exceed 10\" in '..../logical/object.scala:290'\n\nSince this pull request already appends the grouping key automatically, I was thinking if we really need to pass 'key' as R functions input argument - function(key, x) {....} Isn't it superfluous ?\nI'd be happy to hear your thoughts on that.\n\nThanks!\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTest cases in R.\n","created_at":"2016-08-01T01:04:39Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:23Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b2b55347f094f388bbeaa65842f8b6347c3223c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARKR","name":"SPARKR","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/44ee864d1a787115ab9591fcc095bd560fb6a55f","head":{"label":"NarineK:gapply-add-key-attach-option","ref":"gapply-add-key-attach-option","sha":"44ee864d1a787115ab9591fcc095bd560fb6a55f","user":{"login":"NarineK","id":12010601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDEwNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12010601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK","html_url":"https://github.com/NarineK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42900480,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkwMDQ4MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"NarineK/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NarineK","id":12010601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDEwNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12010601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK","html_url":"https://github.com/NarineK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NarineK/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, we are using `hive.default.fileformat` for specifying the default file format in CREATE TABLE statement. Multiple issues exist:\n- This parameter value is not from `hive-site.xml`. Thus, even if users change the hive.default.fileformat in `hive-site.xml`, Spark will ignore it. To change the parameter values, users have to use Spark interface, (e.g., by a SET command or API). \n- This parameter is not documented. \n- This parameter value will not be sent to Hive metastore. It is being used by Spark internals when processing CREATE TABLE statement. \n- This parameter is case sensitive. \n\nSince this is being used by Spark only, it does not make sense to use a parameter starting from `hive`. we might follow the other Hive-related parameters and introduce a new Spark parameter here. It should be public. Thus, this PR is to replace `hive.default.fileformat` by `spark.sql.default.fileformat`. It also makes it case insensitive.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases\n","created_at":"2016-07-31T21:08:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T14:05:48Z","closed_at":"2016-11-07T03:24:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14430/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14430/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14430/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b64edc41dca6e0600ecb40d685d3a7001cb8a3d","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:setHive","ref":"setHive","sha":"7b64edc41dca6e0600ecb40d685d3a7001cb8a3d","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs of Scala 2.11.x there is no longer a org.scala-lang:jline version aligned to the scala version itself. Scala console now uses the plain jline:jline module. Spark's  dependency management did not reflect this change properly, causing Maven to pull in Jline via transitive dependency. Unfortunately Jline 2.12 contained a minor but very annoying bug rendering the shell almost useless for developers with german keyboard layout. This request contains the following chages:\n- Exclude transitive dependency 'jline:jline' from hive-exec module\n- Remove global properties 'jline.version' and 'jline.groupId'\n- Add both properties and dependency to 'scala-2.11' profile\n- Add explicit dependency on 'jline:jline' to  module 'spark-repl'\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Running mvn dependency:tree and checking for correct Jline version 2.12.1\n- Running full builds with assembly and checking for jline-2.12.1.jar in 'lib' folder of generated tarball\n","created_at":"2016-07-31T13:26:58Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T00:09:23Z","closed_at":"2016-08-04T00:09:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43a363690c4d6124a53c466d5cfaca2b909f0b15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14429/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14429/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14429/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/35cc6c3f62ff9895f2786df73c56f46ba890497a","head":{"label":"stsc-pentasys:SPARK-16770","ref":"SPARK-16770","sha":"35cc6c3f62ff9895f2786df73c56f46ba890497a","user":{"login":"stsc-pentasys","id":6389280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODkyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6389280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys","html_url":"https://github.com/stsc-pentasys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64546741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDU0Njc0MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"stsc-pentasys/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stsc-pentasys","id":6389280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODkyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6389280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys","html_url":"https://github.com/stsc-pentasys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stsc-pentasys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stsc-pentasys/spark","description":"Mirror
