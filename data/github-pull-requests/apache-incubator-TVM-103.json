Most likely any external codegen needs some memoization. It would be better to take care of this in the Relay side once for all, so that there would be no chance of forgetting to do memoization and having a bad time (which happened to me). \r\n\r\nplease

PR fixes an issue with the AnnotateTarget -> MergeCompilerRegions -> PartitionGraph flow. When the output of a subgraph is accessed multiple times by other nodes in the relay program, that output is duplicated in the subgraph function output tuple. Added test case `test_duplicate_outputs` as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the partitioned graph before this fix. You can see that the Tuple in the `test_duplicate_outputs_0` subgraph has repeated the result of `abs` 3 times because it is accessed by 3 different nodes in the main function.\r\n```\r\ndef @test_duplicate_outputs_0(%test_duplicate_outputs_0_i0: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], Inline=1, Compiler=\"test_duplicate_outputs\", global_symbol=\"test_duplicate_outputs_0\", Primitive=1) ->

@test_duplicate_outputs_0(%test_duplicate_outputs_0_i0: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], Inline=1, Compiler=\"test_duplicate_outputs\", global_symbol=\"test_duplicate_outputs_0\", Primitive=1) ->

https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5310 which prevents a similar bug in which the input args to a subgraph are duplicated.","created_at":"2020-04-13T19:10:06Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T20:33:59Z","closed_at":"2020-04-15T20:33:32Z","merged_at":"2020-04-15T20:33:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"09eb50820b1629f77531acaad16701bf572293f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

use ObjectRef and their sub-classes extensively throughout our codebase.\r\nEach of ObjectRef's sub-classes are nullable, which means they can hold nullptr\r\nas their values.\r\n\r\nWhile in some places we need nullptr as an alternative value. The implicit support\r\nfor nullptr in all ObjectRef creates additional burdens for the developer\r\nto explicitly check defined in many places of the codebase.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is unclear from the API's intentional point of view whether\r\nwe want a nullable object or not-null version(many cases we want the later).\r\n\r\nBorrowing existing wisdoms from languages like Rust. We propose to\r\nintroduce non-nullable ObjectRef, and Optional<T> container that\r\nrepresents a nullable variant.\r\n\r\nTo keep backward compatiblity, we will start by allowing most ObjectRef to be nullable.\r\nHowever, we should start to use Optional<T> as the type in places where\r\nwe know nullable is a requirement. Gradually, we will move most of the ObjectRef\r\nto be non-nullable and use Optional<T> in the nullable cases.\r\n\r\nSuch explicitness in typing can help reduce the potential problems\r\nin our codebase overall.\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\n- Introduce _type_is_nullable attribute to ObjectRef\r\n- Introduce Optional<T>\r\n- Change String to be non-nullable.\r\n- Change the API of function->GetAttr to return Optional<T>\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-12T22:08:10Z","updated_at":"2020-04-13T17:57:50Z","closed_at":"2020-04-13T17:49:49Z","merged_at":"2020-04-13T17:49:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc75de9d680ada8a8ac4b258a60c3f70de1c2e07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5314/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5314/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5314/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3db3ad87e0e9bdb8ec05cc907cc28f76eeb58f0a","head":{"label":"tqchen:optional","ref":"optional","sha":"3db3ad87e0e9bdb8ec05cc907cc28f76eeb58f0a","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.co

PR\r\n\r\n- Removes the duplicated outputs to the followed subgraphs. Previously, there would be two outputs from A to (B, C) if both B and C use the output from A where actually one is enough.\r\n\r\n- Enables MobileNet test on DNNL by allocating the large constant array on the static section instead of the heap and then assigning then one by one. Note the compilation time would be slightly longer (< 2mins on a P2 instance).\r\n\r\n- Fixes the way we used to save the intermediate output by directly caching and returning it in the post order

`lower_warp_memory` lowers memory bound to \"warp\" scope into the warp shuffle intrinsic. Currently, this pass only supports the situation where the extent of `threadIdx.x` equals to the warp size. However, CUDA's `__shfl` has a 3rd parameter `width` to shuffle variables in half (or 1/4, 1/8, 1/16) of a warp. This PR uses this extra parameter to enable Pass `lower_warp_memory` when the extent of `threadIdx.x` is less than the warp size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n1. Add a 3rd parameter `width` and a 4th parameter `warp_size` to TVM intrinsic `tvm_warp_shuffle`. The 4th parameter `warp_size` is used to help a Code Generator to decide whether a `width` is legal. For example, the OpenCL backend dose not support the `width` parameter, so it has to check whether `width == warp_size`. Since currently `lower_warp_memory` is the only pass that utilize `tvm_warp_shuffle`, this change will not break any dependencies.\r\n2. Code Generators that lowers `tvm_warp_shuffle` are modified. Currently, the only two affected Code Generators are CUDA and OpenCL.\r\n3. In `lower_warp_memory`, find the value of `width` first, and then alter the IR base on `width`, instead of based on `warp_size`. Then, it generate the modified `tvm_warp_shuffle` intrinsic.\r\n4. A test which runs `lower_warp_memory` with 1/2 warp size is added.\r\n\r\nCan @tqchen, @ZihengJiang or @ajtulloch make a review or suggest any other

PR builds on the control flow support added in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4964 and aims to support more realistic recurrent networks than the simple one in #4964. Specifically the goal is to enable translating LSTM models in the PyTorch repo https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/benchmarks/fastrnns described in [their blog post](https://pytorch.org/blog/optimizing-cuda-rnn-with-torchscript/).\r\n\r\nTranslating these models requires taking care of dynamic lists and tensor shape. I added necessary support in the Torch frontend using prelude List ADT, static Tensor array https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5103, and Any. Previously we can only translate \"tensors in, tensors out\" type of models, but now we can ingest more complex inputs such as list of tuple of tensors. \r\n\r\nSee the new test cases for the kinds of models we can support now. I added some variants of LSTMs:\r\n* LSTM with layer normalization\r\n* Bidirectional\r\n* Stacked\r\n* Stacked and Bidirectional\r\n\r\nThe result of translating three layer stacked bidirectional LSTMs is dumped [here](https://gist.github.com/masahi/7754387797169380c32c8f93a9cbe9e3). Even though this model has three loop nest,\r\n```\r\nfor layer in num_layers:\r\n    for dir in [\"forward\", \"backward\"]:\r\n        seq_len = input.size(0)\r\n        for i in seq_len:\r\n              ...\r\n```\r\nthe two outer loops are unrolled by Torchscript. So in the Relay IR dump, there are 3 (layers) x 2 (direction) while loops.\r\n\r\nplease review @kevinthesun @zhiics @MarisaKirisame @icemelon9 @jwfromm @wweic @alexwong \r\ncc @tqchen @jroesch

PR is a pretty direct port of the conv2d tensorcore schedules introduced in [PR #5099](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5099) to conv3d. In my early testing I've found this new schedule to be up to 10X faster than the default conv3d schedule. I also snuck one little adjustment into the conv3d winograd schedule that helps for smaller workloads. Given that tensorcore support is currently only for `NHWC` and `NDHWC` layouts, I've also added support for converting to these layouts using the `ConvertLayout` pass.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-08T23:06:41Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:57:24Z","closed_at":"2020-04-13T17:49:18Z","merged_at":"2020-04-13T17:49:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"3df8d560f2b6d34ba43a069cd5809560d2c96983","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-coreml-runtime/6309\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a runtime to load and execute CoreML models from TVM.  To run CoreML inference via RPC, please setup [iOS TVM RPC](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/tree/master/apps/ios_rpc) beforehand.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for a baseline benchmark measurement.  In addition, we could extract a subgraph and offload it to CoreML with this runtime - it would be important for optimization on iOS since using CoreML is the only way to leverage Apple's Neural Engine.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @ZihengJiang @FrozenGene  Could you help to review

we are working on TRT support with BYOC infra, we added some features and fixed some bugs in AnnotateTarget and MergeCompilerRegion passes. Here are the change logs:\r\n\r\n**Refactor 1**: Both AnnotateTarget and MergeCompilerRegion passes output a graph with all ops annotated. Ops that will be handled by TVM will also be annotated with target \"default\".\r\n - Accordingly, we don't need AnnotateRestDefault anymore.\r\n - Accordingly, we don't remove default annotation at the end of MergeCompilerRegion.\r\n - A workaround that adds a temporary pass to remove all default annotations. A TODO was added to remind us improving partition graph pass later.\r\n - Fixed the issue that AnnotateRestDefault mis-annotated composite functions (because we integrate this pass into AnnotateTarget.)\r\n - Fixed the namespace of MergeCompilerRegion.\r\n - Fixed type propagation and tuple bug in AnnotateTarget pass (@trevor-m ).\r\n\r\n**Refactor 2**: Support multiple runs for AnnotateTarget. Users may run AnnotateTarget multiple times because different targets may need the Relay graph at different stage (e.g., before or after QnnCanonicalize pass). This refactor makes sure AnnotateTarget pass can handle a Relay graph that has been annotated.\r\n\r\n**Refactor 3**:  Support Multiple Targets in AnnotateTarget pass. In case more than one targets can take the same Relay graph, we intend to run AnnotateTarget once to annotate all of them to open global optimization opportunities for future developments.\r\n- Now AnnotateTarget takes either a target string or a list of targets. AnnotateTarget will invoke target specific op-based rule functions in order.\r\n- Accordingly, now regions in AnnotateRegionSet also have target attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @zhiics, @trevor-m,

PR introduces RValue reference support the PackedFunc calling convention to address the above issue. Specifically, when an argument is a r-value reference, we will use a assign a different type code(`kObjectRValueRefArg`), and pass `Object**`  (the address to the Object pointer) instead through the values array. The callee can choose to move out this Object pointer and set the original Object pointer from the caller side to be nullptr.\r\n\r\nWe also add move support to the python side. This enhancement will enable copy on write optimizations through out the TVM stack.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-08T01:32:13Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T00:00:42Z","closed_at":"2020-04-11T00:07:21Z","merged_at":"2020-04-11T00:07:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"b72dd9d935ce284d480fd6084f4c9deaee1f9367","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

PR includes two changes to support composite functions as part of the BYOC flow. First, 'check' functions have been added to the MergeComposite pass. Currently you can only do structural pattern matches which don't test any attributes or tensor sizes. The check function accepts the matching expression and can implement arbitrary logic to test whether that match should be supported. See the new test for an example which queries convolution layout.\r\n\r\nThe other change enables the annotation of composite functions in the AnnotateTarget pass. For a composite function to be recognised, you must name it according to the convention:\r\n\r\n{compiler}.{composite_name}\r\neg.

PR includes two fixes to AnnotateTarget pass and testcases for each.\r\n\r\n1. Include TupleNode in annotation when args are also supported. This prevents Tuple from breaking a model into multiple subgraphs when all ops are supported by the external codegen. This is needed to support annotation of concatenate op. Added `test_tuple` test for this fix.\r\n\r\n2. AnnotateTarget is mutating the graph by adding `compiler.begin` and `compiler.end` nodes. The nodes from this **modified graph** are then passed to the registered FTVMAnnotateTarget python functions. Therefore since the modified nodes did not have type information  yet, the python annotation functions could not access the checked_type of the args. I fixed this by manually copying checked_type when new nodes are created in the AnnotateTarget pass. However, we should consider refactoring this pass so that only the unmodified original nodes are passed to FTVMAnnotateTarget functions. Added `test_type_propagation` for this. Without this fix, the testcase would give the error: `ValueError: The type checker has not populated the checked_type for this node`.","created_at":"2020-04-02T18:04:45Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T22:51:35Z","closed_at":"2020-04-03T22:51:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6494899f2aa4b052dc585ab1c591a3e943f5393a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2e191e5676a6d3e619be888c46834f00b8945a39","head":{"label":"trevor-m:annotate-target-fix-type","ref":"annotate-target-fix-type","sha":"2e191e5676a6d3e619be888c46834f00b8945a39","user":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":204561313,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDQ1NjEzMTM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"trevor-m/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m/tvm","description":"Open
