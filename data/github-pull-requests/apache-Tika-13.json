Your help is appreciated!\n\nBefore opening the pull request, please verify that\n* there is an open issue on the [Tika issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TIKA) which describes the problem or the improvement. We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met. If you have any questions how to fix your problem or about using Tika in general, please sign up for the [Tika mailing list](http://tika.apache.org/mail-lists.html).

[mockito-core](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) from 4.11.0 to 5.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases\">mockito-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Mockito 5: prepare for future JDK versions</h1>\n<p>For a while now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<p>There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new <code>mockito-subclass</code> artifact (published <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass\">on Maven Central</a> along with all our other artifacts).</p>\n<h2>Update the minimum supported Java version to 11</h2>\n<p>Mockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.\nSimilar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.\nThe primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.\nLately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.\nAdditionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798\">issues with the <code>SecurityManager</code></a>.\nSince we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>What should I do if I still run JDK 8?</h3>\n<p>For JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.\nThis is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.\nThe changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.\nHowever, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.</p>\n<h2>New <code>type()</code> method on <code>ArgumentMatcher</code></h2>\n<p>One of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/ArgumentMatcher.html\"><code>ArgumentMatcher</code> interface</a>.\nThe interface allows you to define a custom matcher, which you can pass into method arguments to provide more targeted matches.\nOne major shortcoming of the <code>ArgumentMatcher</code> was the lack of varargs support.</p>\n<!-- raw

We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.

We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.

We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.
