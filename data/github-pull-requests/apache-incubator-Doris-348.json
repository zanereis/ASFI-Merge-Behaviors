Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDoris's Routine Load realizes the import of data from Kafka to Doris, and make a feature of real-time synchronization of data from Pulsar to Doris based on Pulsar IO.\r\n1. The custom abstract class DorisAbstractSink<T> implements the interface org.apache.pulsar.io.core.Sink.\r\n\r\n2. The DorisGenericRecordSink class inherits the abstract class DorisAbstractSink<T>, and the specified source data format is org.apache.pulsar.client.api.schema.GenericRecord.\r\n\r\n3. Implement the open and write methods, initialize the configuration file in open(), and implement the logic of inserting data in write().\r\n\r\n4. Construct JsonArray through Stream Load, and then flush data to Doris.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-19T09:03:40Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T02:47:34Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T02:47:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04757180a53cca490229148036b98d52c8dcde8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1099563192,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk5NTYzMTky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/feature","name":"kind/feature","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\nAdd transaction for the operation of insert. It will cost less time than non-transaction(it will cost 1/1000 time) when you want to insert a amount of rows.\r\n### Syntax\r\n\r\n```\r\nBEGIN [ WITH LABEL label];\r\nINSERT INTO table_name ...\r\n[COMMIT | ROLLBACK];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\ncommit a transaction:\r\n```\r\nbegin;\r\ninsert into Tbl values(11, 22, 33);\r\ncommit;\r\n```\r\nrollback a transaction:\r\n```\r\nbegin;\r\ninsert into Tbl values(11, 22, 33);\r\nrollback;\r\n```\r\ncommit a transaction with label:\r\n```\r\nbegin with label test_label;\r\ninsert into Tbl values(11, 22, 33);\r\ncommit;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n```\r\nbegin:  begin a transaction, the next insert will execute in the transaction until commt/rollback;\r\ncommit:  commit the transaction, the data in the transaction will be inserted into the table;\r\nrollback:  abort the transaction, nothing will be inserted into the table;\r\n```\r\n### The main realization principle:\r\n```\r\n1. begin a transaction in the session. next sql is executed in the transaction;\r\n2. insert sql will be parser and get the database name and table name, they will be used to select a be and create a pipe to accept data;\r\n3. all inserted values will be sent to the be and write into the pipe;\r\n4. a thread will get the data from the pipe, then write them to disk;\r\n5. commit will complete this transaction and make these data visable;\r\n6. rollback will abort this transaction\r\n```\r\n### Some restrictions on the use of update syntax.\r\n1. Only ```insert``` can be called in a transaction.\r\n2. If something error happened, ```commit``` will not succeed, it will ```rollback``` directly;\r\n3. By default, if part of insert in the transaction is invalid, ```commit``` will only insert the other correct data into the table.\r\n4. If you need ```commit``` return failed when any insert in the transaction is invalid, you need execute ```set enable_insert_strict = true``` before ```begin```.\r\n \r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n    [Update] Support update syntax\r\n\r\n    The current update syntax only supports updating the filtered data of a single table.\r\n\r\n    Syntax:\r\n\r\n     * UPDATE table_reference\r\n     *     SET assignment_list\r\n     *     [WHERE where_condition]\r\n     *\r\n     * value:\r\n     *     {expr}\r\n     *\r\n     * assignment:\r\n     *     col_name = value\r\n     *\r\n     * assignment_list:\r\n     *     assignment [, assignment] ...\r\n\r\n    Example\r\n    Update unique_table\r\n         set v1=1\r\n         where k1=1\r\n\r\n    New Frontend Config: enable_concurrent_update\r\n    This configuration is used to control whether multi update stmt can be executed concurrently in one table.\r\n    Default value is false which means A table can only have one update task being executed at the same time.\r\n    If users want to update the same table concurrently,\r\n      they need to modify the configuration value to true and restart the master frontend.\r\n    Concurrent updates may cause write conflicts, the result is uncertain, please be careful.\r\n\r\n    The main realization principle:\r\n    1. Read the rows that meet the conditions according to the conditions set by where clause.\r\n    2. Modify the result of the row according to the set clause.\r\n    3. Write the modified row back to the table.\r\n\r\n    Some restrictions on the use of update syntax.\r\n    1. Only the unique table can be updated\r\n    2. Only the value column of the unique table can be updated\r\n    3. The where clause currently only supports single tables\r\n\r\n    Possible risks:\r\n    1. Since the current implementation method is a row update,\r\n         when the same table is updated concurrently, there may be concurrency conflicts which may cause the incorrect result.\r\n    2. Once the conditions of the where clause are unsatisfactory, it is likely to cause a full table scan and affect query performance.\r\n       Please pay attention to whether the column in the where clause can match the index when using it.\r\n\r\n    [Docs][Update] Add update document and sql-reference\r\n\r\n    Fixed #6229\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe current JoinReorder algorithm mainly sorts according to the star model,\r\nand only considers the query association relationship between the table and the table.\r\nThe problems are following:\r\n1. Only applicable to user data whose data model is a star model, data of other models cannot be sorted.\r\n2. Regardless of the cost of the table, it is impossible to determine the size of the join table relationship,\r\n   and the real query optimization ability is weak.\r\n3. It is impossible to avoid possible time-consuming joins such as cross joins by sorting.\r\n\r\nThe new JoinReorder algorithm mainly introduces a new sorting algorithm for Join\r\nThe new ranking algorithm introduces the cost evaluation model to Doris.\r\n\r\nThe sorting algorithm is mainly based on the following three principles:\r\n1. The order is: Largest node, Smallest node. . . Second largest node\r\n2. Cross join is better than Inner join\r\n3. The right children of Outer join, semi join, and anti join do not move\r\n\r\nPlanNode's cost model evaluation mainly relies on two values: cardinality and selectivity.\r\ncardinality: cardinality, can also be simply understood as the number of rows.\r\nselectivity: selectivity, a value between 0 and 1. Predicate generally has selectivity.\r\nThe cost model generally calculates the final cardinality of a PlanNode based on the pre-calculated\r\ncardinality of PlanNode and the selectivity of the predicate to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can configure \"enable_cost_based_join_reorder\" to control the opening and closing of JoinReorder.\r\nWhen the configuration is turned on, the new sorting algorithm will take effect, when it is turned off,\r\nthe old sorting algorithm will take effect, and it is turned off by default.\r\n\r\nThe new sorting algorithm currently has no cost base evaluation for external tables (odbc, es)\r\nand set calculations (intersect, except). When using these queries, it is not recommended to enable cost base join reoder.\r\nWhen using these queries, it is not recommended to enable cost base join reoder.\r\n\r\nAt the code architecture level:\r\n1. The new sorting algorithm occurs in the single-node execution planning stage.\r\n2. Refactored the init and finalize phases of PlanNode to ensure that PlanNode planning\r\n   and cost evaluation have been completed before the sorting algorithm occurs.\r\n\r\nChange-Id: I6a89b20d70ff1d49909900f39337fa31cc8efd1e\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [x] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n#6206 \r\n\r\nAt present, our image file does not have file header/footer. When we need to change the image format (such as adding different journal versions to the image), there is no way to distinguish different image formats.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we suggest adding file header and footer to the image. By the new image format, we can freely distinguish and define different image reading ways.\r\n\r\nThe format of the image is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Image Format:\r\n * |- Image --------------------------------------|\r\n * | - Magic String (4 bytes)                     |\r\n * | - Header Length (4 bytes)                    |\r\n * | |- Header -----------------------------|     |\r\n * | | |- Json Header ---------------|      |     |\r\n * | | | - version                   |      |     |\r\n * | | | - other key/value(undecided)|      |     |\r\n * | | |-----------------------------|      |     |\r\n * | |--------------------------------------|     |\r\n * |                                              |\r\n * | |- Image Body -------------------------|     |\r\n * | | Object a                             |     |\r\n * | | Object b                             |     |\r\n * | | ...                                  |     |\r\n * | |--------------------------------------|     |\r\n * |                                              |\r\n * | |- Footer -----------------------------|     |\r\n * | | | - Checksum (8 bytes)               |     |\r\n * | | |- object index --------------|      |     |\r\n * | | | - index a                   |      |     |\r\n * | | | - index b                   |      |     |\r\n * | | | ...                         |      |     |\r\n * | | |-----------------------------|      |     |\r\n * | | - other value(undecided)             |     |\r\n * | |--------------------------------------|     |\r\n * | - Footer Length (8 bytes)                    |\r\n * | - Magic String (4 bytes)                     |\r\n * |----------------------------------------------|\r\n */\r\n```\r\n1. Magic Nuumber\r\nOne image format is identified by one magic string and one version field. The magic string is save in the first 4 bytes and last 4 bytes in the images.\r\n\r\n2. Image Header:\r\nThe version is save in the header with json format now.\r\n\r\n3. Image Body:\r\nEqual to the original image.\r\n\r\n4.Image Footer:\r\nImage footer stores the file offset(index) of many image objects. If necessary, we can read some objects in the image by the footer.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #6206 ) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-12T13:37:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-27T05:36:53Z","closed_at":"2021-07-27T05:36:53Z","merged_at":"2021-07-27T05:36:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1f597910338af09cf762f95d98d734b25c2685c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1992285151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkyMjg1MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/meta-version-change","name":"kind/meta-version-change","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe log4j-config.xml will be generated at startup of FE and also when modifying FE config.\r\nBut in some deploy environment such as k8s, the conf dir is not writable.\r\n\r\nSo change the dir of log4j-config.xml to Config.custom_conf_dir.\r\n\r\nAlso fix some small bugs:\r\n\r\n1. Typo \"less then\" -> \"less than\"\r\n2. Duplicated `exec_mem_limit` showed in SHOW ROUTINE LOAD\r\n3. Allow MAXVALUE in single partition column table.\r\n4. Add IP info for \"intolerate index channel failure\" msg.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn the previous implementation, we will eliminate non-surviving BEs in the Coordinator phase.\r\nBut for Spark or Flink Connector, there is no such logic, so when a BE node is down,\r\nit will cause the problem of querying errors through the Connector.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-12T03:54:18Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T03:18:06Z","closed_at":"2021-07-13T03:17:50Z","merged_at":"2021-07-13T03:17:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"d79cdc829ffcc742a9331fb4705fa93bce1dbd85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nStep 1 and 2 of #5902 \r\nThis CL mainly changes:\r\n\r\n1. Support setting tags for BE nodes:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    alter system add backend \"1272:9050, 1212:9050\" properties(\"tag.location\": \"zoneA\");\r\n    alter system modify backend \"1272:9050, 1212:9050\" set (\"tag.location\": \"zoneB\");\r\n    ```\r\n    And for compatibility, all BE nodes will be set a \"default\" tag when upgrading: `\"tag.location\": \"default\"`.\r\n\r\n2. Create a new class `ReplicaAllocation` to replace the previous `replication_num`.\r\n\r\n    `ReplicaAllocation` represents the allocation of the replicas of a tablet. It contains a map from \r\n    Tag to number of replicas.\r\n    For example, if user set a table's replication num to 3, it will be converted to a ReplicaAllocation\r\n    like: `\"tag.location.default\" : \"3\"`, which means the tablet will have 3 replicas and all of them will be\r\n    allocated in BE nodes with tag \"default\";\r\n\r\n3. Support create table with replication allocation:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    CREATE TABLE example_db.table_hash\r\n    (\r\n    k1 TINYINT\r\n    )\r\n    DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(k1) BUCKETS 32\r\n    PROPERTIES (\r\n        \"replication_allocation\"=\"tag.location.zone1:1, tag.location.zone2:2\"\r\n    );\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Also support set replica allocation for dynamic tables, and modify replica allocation at runtime.\r\n\r\n    For compatibility, user can still set \"replication_num\" = \"3\", and it will be automatically converted to:\r\n    ` \"replication_allocation\"=\"tag.location.default:3\"`\r\n\r\n4. Support tablet repair and balance based on Tag\r\n\r\n    1. For tablets of non-colocate table, most of the logic is the same as before,\r\n       but when selecting the destination node for clone, the tag of the node will be considered.\r\n       If the required tag does not exist, it cannot be repaired.\r\n       Similarly, under the condition of ensuring that the replicas are complete, the tablet will be\r\n       reallocated according to the tag or the replicas will be balanced.\r\n\r\n       Balancing is performed separately within each resource group.\r\n\r\n    2. For tablets of colocate table, the backends sequence of buckets will be splitted by tag.\r\n       For example, if replica allocation is \"tag.location.zone1:1, tag.location.zone2:2\",\r\n\r\n       And zone1 has 2 BE: A, B; zone2 has 3 BE: C, D, F\r\n\r\n       there will be 2 backend sequences: one is for zone1, and the other is for zone2.\r\n       And one posible seqeunces will be:\r\n\r\n\r\n       zone1: [A]   [B]   [A]   [B]\r\n       zone2: [C, D][D, F][F, C][C, D]\r\n\r\n5. Support setting tags for user and restrict execution node with tags:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    set property for 'cmy' 'resource_tags.location' : 'zone1, zone2';\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    After setting, the user 'cmy' can only query data stored on backends with tag zone1 and zone2,\r\n    And query can only be executed on backends with tag zone1 and zone2\r\n\r\n\r\n    For compatibility, after upgrading, the property `resource_tags.location` will be empty,\r\n    so that user can still query data stored on any backends.\r\n\r\n6. Modify the Unit test frame of FE so that we can created multi backends with different mocked IP in unit test.\r\n\r\n    This help us to easily test some distributed cases like query, tablet repair and balance\r\n\r\nThe document will be added in another PR.\r\n\r\nAlso fix a bug described in #6194 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency.

 `select @@version_comment …` right after login, when there is no backend available, the login will fail.\r\n\r\nI make this pr to support login when no be available, so we can add backend or modify some configuaration using GUI sql tools, especially the first setup time.\r\n\r\nThis pr is working at precondition that，sql tools only query very simple information that fe can handle, there is no

Proposed changes\r\nFix issue:#6116\r\n\r\n- `RuntimeFilterGenerator` is used to generate Runtime Filter and assign it to the node that uses Runtime Filter in the query plan.\r\n\r\n- `RuntimeFilter` represents a filter in the query plan, including the specific properties of the filter, the binding method of expr and tuple slot, etc.\r\n\r\n- `RuntimeFilterTarget` indicates the filter information provided to ScanNode, including target expr, whether to merge, etc.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAlter doing schema change job, Doris will check all rowsets of the new tablet.\r\nIt will first get all versions of the new tablet by calling `rowset->list_version()`,\r\nthan get rowset of each version by calling `tablet->get_rowset_by_version()`,\r\n\r\nBut these 2 calls are not protected by tablet meta lock, so there may be some undefined behavior.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #6119 ) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T11:40:43Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T01:19:11Z","closed_at":"2021-07-01T01:19:11Z","merged_at":"2021-07-01T01:19:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a5f0f859da09adaa34246a1b9424c3d657811d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes
