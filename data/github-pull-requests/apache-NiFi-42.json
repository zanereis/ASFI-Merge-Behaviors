In addition, I changed the NiFi UI deps to use lodash instead of lodash-core. I did this because lodash-core is still using an older version of lodash and there is no indication they will update to utilize the 4.17.21 release (see [current open issues](https://github.com/Sylvain59650/lodash-core/issues)).\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Also there were \"file exists\" validators on filenames that only have to exist on the target system not the NiFi system, so I changed those as well. I tried on both Livy for Spark 1/2 and Livy for Spark 3 using the Livy 0.7.0 API.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9471 Corrects `PutKudu` usage of `DataTypeUtils.toString()` by passing the Record Field format pattern instead of the Record Field name as the second argument of the `toString()` method. This avoids a potential `IllegalArgumentException` when `DataTypeUtils.toString()` attempts to use the pattern to create a `SimpleDateFormat` for formatting Date and Timestamp objects as strings.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9457 Updates String to Timestamp conversion in `PutKudu` to support optional fractional seconds with up to microsecond resolution.\r\n\r\nThe Kudu `UNIXTIME_MICROS` type uses `java.sql.Timestamp` objects with up to microsecond precision, but the `DataTypeUtils.toTimestamp()` method does not support microsecond resolution due to the internal use of `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` for parsing Strings to `java.util.Date` objects prior to conversion to `java.sql.Timestamp`.\r\n\r\nThe solution includes a new `ObjectTimestampFieldConverter` class with generalized support for converting objects of various types to `java.sql.Timestamp`. The converter follows a similar approach to `DataTypeUtils.toTimestamp()` but uses `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` and `java.time.LocalDateTime` for parsing Strings. This approach is not yet suitable for generalized use, but it works for `PutKudu` since the conversion in `buildPartialRow` does not support user-provided format patterns.\r\n\r\nUsing the custom timestamp pattern for Record `TIMESTAMP` fields together with `DateTimeFormatter` allows `PutKudu` to support both current String-based timestamps using the default format as well as String-based timestamps that include microseconds. Unit tests for `PutKudu` illustrate the supported behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9448 Improves Site-to-Site HTTP client processing for extend transaction exception handling.\r\n\r\nAs part of sending or receive files over an HTTP S2S connection, the `SiteToSiteRestApiClient` starts a background command to request extension of the current transaction on a periodic basis. In situations when the underlying HTTP connection pool throws an `IllegalStateException`, the background command attempts to close the parent `SiteToSiteRestApiClient`. This behavior short-circuits potential retry attempts that might otherwise be allowed according to the configured timeout settings.\r\n\r\nThese changes include refactoring the background command to a separate `ExtendTransactionCommand` class for easier testing. With the main `SiteToSiteRestApiClient` already wrapping an Apache HttpComponents `HttpClient` instance and connection pool, the refactored `ExtendTransactionCommand` reuses the same client and connection pool as opposed to creating a new instance of `SiteToSiteRestApiClient`. Additional changes include a null check in `PeerSelector` to avoid a potential `NullPointerException` when the Peer Persistence property is not configured. This pull request also removes the `SiteToSiteClientIT` as it does not provide significant value beyond the existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSHA: 5aced2b4bc66d2dd85b1507755fff2b1fb8c4a64\r\n\r\nThe hashmap does not have a guaranteed iteration order, in the process of ```BulletinMerger.mergeBulletins()``` (line-78), the order of [copyOfBulletin1, bulletinEntity1] in the list can be eithter ```copyOfBulletin1``` first or ```bulletinEntity1``` first. The ```mergeBulletins()``` will keep the most recent bulletin with the larger time, and because all BulletinEntity are created from the function ```createBulletin()```(line-38) and have the same time property in this test, ```mergeBulletins()``` will just keep the first in the list. So sometimes bulletinEntity1 will be returned instead of ```copyOfBulletin1```, which results in the failure (line-80): ```assertTrue(bulletinEntities.contains(copyOfBulletin1));```\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is replacing ```LinkedHashMap``` with ```Hashmap``` to insure the determinism. After this change, the order will always be ```bulletinEntity1``` before the ```copyOfBulletin1``` and the merge results will always contain ```bulletinEntity1``` instead of ```copyOfBulletin1```. So I also change the assertion to ```assertTrue(bulletinEntities.contains(bulletinEntity1)```;\r\n\r\n// another fix can be using Thread.sleep() between the variable declaration of ```copyOfBulletin1``` and ```bulletinEntity1```, in this case, they should have different ```time``` property, and the code won't be flaky anymore\r\n\r\nThe way to reproduce the flaky test failure:\r\n - 0.Environment setup: Maven 3.6.0 and Java 1.8.0_292\r\n - 1.clone the repo:\r\n   > git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-cassandra\r\n  cd spring-data-cassandra\r\n  git checkout 5aced2b4bc66d2dd85b1507755fff2b1fb8c4a64\r\n\r\n - 2.run with [Nondex tool](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) (which explores different behaviors of under-determined APIs and reports test failures)\r\n   >  mvn install -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-framework-cluster -am -DskipTests\r\n  mvn -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-framework-cluster edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:debug -Dtest=org.apache.nifi.cluster.manager.BulletinMergerTest#mergeBulletins\r\n \r\n  - 3.then we can get the test failure:\r\n    > [INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   BulletinMergerTest.mergeBulletins:80 expected [true] but found [false]\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\nAnd ```BulletinMergerTest.mergeBulletins``` line-80 is :\r\n```assertTrue(bulletinEntities.contains(copyOfBulletin1));```\r\nin this case, the ```bulletinEntities``` did not contain ```copyOfBulletin1``` but ```bulletinEntity1```.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-05T02:19:46Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T18:32:03Z","closed_at":"2021-12-09T18:32:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90fa71d5290aec5b9faa8fe301c26d6f7409392c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/b3b8ddf4043d2cc7c9d030e468997f9b92c96d4c","head":{"label":"LeoYimingLi:BulletinMergerTest-patch-1","ref":"BulletinMergerTest-patch-1","sha":"b3b8ddf4043d2cc7c9d030e468997f9b92c96d4c","user":{"login":"LeoYimingLi","id":46290389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjkwMzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46290389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoYimingLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":426713194,"node_id":"R_kgDOGW8gag","name":"nifi","full_name":"LeoYimingLi/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LeoYimingLi","id":46290389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjkwMzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46290389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoYimingLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoYimingLi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LeoYimingLi/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9435 Adds `includedRegistries` and `includedNames` as optional query parameters to the Flow Metrics REST API method to support filtering returned metrics. Both query parameters can be provided multiple times to include multiple selected elements. Specifying the `includedRegistries` parameter performs initial filtering and `includedNames` filters the metric family names from the selected registries.\r\n\r\nThe `includedRegistries` parameter supports the following four values based on the current Prometheus Collector Registries:\r\n\r\n- NIFI\r\n- JVM\r\n- BULLETIN\r\n- CONNECTION\r\n\r\nThe `includedNames` parameter supports any of the metric family names returned from any of the collector registries, such as `nifi_jvm_heap_usage` for the `JVM` registry or `nifi_total_bytes_written` from the `NIFI` registry.\r\n\r\nThese optional parameters preserve the current default behavior while also supporting a reduced response for NiFi deployments with a large number of configured components.\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements include removing redundant `required = false` annotation property settings in `FlowResource` and streamlining several inline function definitions.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-03T22:27:52Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T20:59:24Z","closed_at":"2022-01-13T20:59:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c30f0bbc4ede7e79657346601b7831e23615e055","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/32dc0d3d97019cc5d2faa525ec7b715355203990","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9435","ref":"NIFI-9435","sha":"32dc0d3d97019cc5d2faa525ec7b715355203990","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

make sure that we only cancel its active transaction if the transaction belongs to the appropriate connection. Also ensure that when we do cancel a transaction / call its failure callback, we purge the collection of any FlowFiles that have been sent in that transaction.

Also updated MiNiFi to use the same version of Swagger that NiFi does. Unit tests are not included as the API classes are basically beans.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

To indicate when a value contains leading/trailing whitespace, an icon with a tooltip will show next to the value in processor and controller services configurations.\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n- go to configurations in a processor or controller service\r\n- enter a property value with leading and/or trailing whitespace\r\n- you should see an info icon and tooltip show to the right of the value\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

This behavior leads the ExecuteSQL and ExeccuteSQLRecord processors for a large heap usage. Caching a small amount of records (defined by fetch size) in client side of the connation and retrieving the next data block when exhausted is possible only if auto committing is set to false. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32428342/143688260-8ba6defa-ea15-4c62-a163-f15024009ad0.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new property for above mentioned two processors to enable/disable auto-committing in the connection.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

a single onTrigger\r\n\r\nMergeRecord processed the FlowFiles in multiple onTrigger-s and it needed an extra onTrigger call\r\n(with no incoming FFs) to realize that no more FFs are available and it is time to send the merged FF downstream.\r\nIt was not compatible with Stateless Runtime which does not trigger the flow any more if no FFs available.\r\n\r\nAlso changed \"unschedule\" logic in StandardProcessorTestRunner: @OnUnscheduled methods were called immediately after\r\nthe 1st FlowFile was processed. Unschedule the processor only at the end of the execution (onTrigger finished)\r\nand only if stopOnFinish has been requested by the test case.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9391\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9394 Removes the `TimerFilter` and `RequestLogger` classes along with associated configuration from the NiFi web application. These components are redundant with the implementation of standard HTTP Request Logging for [NIFI-9291](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5527).\r\n\r\nThe `RequestLogger` provides logging for unencrypted HTTP requests, which are not present in the default configuration as of NiFi 1.14.0. The `TimerFilter` tracks request duration and custom HTTP request headers that cluster nodes use for request replication, but the class logs messages at the debug level. These custom headers can be logged, along with request duration, using a custom log format defined using `nifi.web.request.log.format` in `nifi.properties`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9399 Updates the `TransformXml` Processor to apply the `Secure Processing` property to configured XSLT sources.\r\n\r\nThe implementation uses `XmlUtils.createSafeReader()` to wrap the XSLT `StreamSource` in an `XMLStreamReader` configured with external entity resolution disabled. Updated unit tests verify intended behavior for both input XML and configured XSLT sources. Additional changes include updating Saxon HE from 9.6.0-5 to 10.6, and removing the unused `XsltValidator` private static class.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Using a CacheBuilder from Guava and buckets from Bucket4j, this processor can read a bucket key from the record or the default value given by the attribute, and check if the rate limit is respected. You have several parameters to configure the rate limiter like, refill tokens, refill period, bandwidth capacity, max size bucket, and expire duration. All of which have specific descriptions reusing the apache documentation of the Bucket4j library. \r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9393 Updates the component mapping process to set the `Scheduled State` for Input Ports, Output Ports, and Remote Group Ports when downloading a Flow Definition as JSON from a Process Group.\r\n\r\nChanges include updating the Standard Process Group to disable Input Ports, Output Ports, and Remote Group Ports when uploading a Flow Definition with those components having a Scheduled State of `DISABLED`. These changes preserve `DISABLED` status when downloading and uploading Flow Definitions, aligning with similar capabilities supported through Templates.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdds `nifi.stateless.status.task.schedule` to the NiFi Stateless Engine configuration, allowing the `LogComponentStatuses` background task schedule to be configurable or omitted altogether if the property is blank.  Exposed this setting to `ExecuteStateless` under a new property named `Status Task Schedule`.\r\n\r\nIf the property is omitted completely from the stateless.properties configuration, a default of 1 minute (the previous value) is used.  If the property is empty, the status logging task is not scheduled at all.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-5821 Updates the allowable value definitions for the `Script Engine` property in `ExecuteScript` and related processors to include the Language Version, Engine Name, and Engine Version in the property description. This approach maintains compatibility with current property value definitions based on Language Name and adds important runtime details about the selected script engine.\r\n\r\nFor example, with the `python` Language Name, the associated property description reads as follows:\r\n\r\n`python 2.7 [jython 2.7.1]`\r\n\r\nThe runtime Java Virtual Machine and supporting libraries drive the associated version numbers.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9291 Introduces standardized HTTP request logging for the NiFi HTTP server. The configuration introduces a new standard log file named `nifi-request.log` and a new logger named `org.apache.nifi.web.server.RequestLog`, both of which can be configured using the standard `logback.xml`. This capability provides configurable request tracking beyond the current optional logging based on custom filters.\r\n\r\nThe implementation leverages the Jetty `CustomRequestLog` and `Slf4jRequestLogWriter` classes to provide configurable formatting and output destinations. The request log format can be configured using a new property named `nifi.web.request.log.format` that defaults to the Combined Log Format, which is the de facto standard for many web servers and log processing systems.\r\n\r\nThe implementation also includes custom Servlet Filter classes to track the Spring Security authenticated username and make it available to the Jetty `CustomRequestLog`. The updated section of the Administrator's Guide describes the new format configuration property and links to the Jetty documentation that describes supported message codes.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

This enables a \"data drift\" scenario, when data comes in meant for new target tables, or if fields are added at the source.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9376 Updates the NiFi Administrator's Guide section `Encrypted Passwords in Flows` to remove the reference to a default hard-coded password when the `nifi.sensitive.props.key` is empty. NiFi 1.14.0 removed this feature and requires a value to be specified for `nifi.sensitive.props.key`. Changes include additional details describing the generation of a random value on standalone installations, and the requirement for a shared value in clustered installations.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

The changes in ##5476 for NIFI-9259 is created for record-based data, while this one can be used for data without schema._\r\n\r\n#### This is how I tested:\r\n\r\n1. Use a GeneraFlowFile processor to generate flowfiles with attributes “lat” and “lon”.\r\n\r\n2. Use a UpdateAttribute processor to update an attribute “geohash”: \r\n    - Tested with combinations of different parameters.\r\n    - For checking the presentation of its documentation, checked the expression-language-guide.html under nifi/nifi-assembly/target/nifi-1.16.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/nifi-1.16.0-SNAPSHOT/docs/html. Also checked the doc when writing the expression in this step 2.\r\n\r\n3. Use a LogAttribute processor to log what has been generated. And I compared this results to the results generated by GeohashRecord Processor, making sure they are identical. \r\n\r\nTesting the decoding functions are very similar to the above process.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9372 Removes unnecessary spaces in the NiFi application startup log. Additional changes include logging bootstrap root key messages at the debug level instead of the informational level. The updated startup log message reads as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarted Application Controller in 17.181 seconds (17181323450 ns)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new `NiFiTest` class replaces the `NiFiGroovyTest` to avoid calling protected and private methods on the `NiFi` class.  The new test class includes more lenient log message evaluation to avoid strict dependence on exact log messages.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

VersionedDataflow using JSON as well as XML, and prefers the JSON representation on load, if it's available. This also results in the need for the cluster protocol to exchange its representation of the dataflow to using JSON. Rather than re-implementing all of the complex logic of Flow Fingerprinting, updated to just inherit the cluster's flow.\r\n\r\n- Note that while the following list of changes may at first seem to be a long list of unrelated improvements, refactorings all gathered into a single PR, it needed to be done this way. Changing flow persistence from XML to JSON meant that the Cluster Coordinator will now provide the flow as a JSON instead of an XML. This breaks our Flow Fingerprint mechanism for determining if a node should be allowed to join a cluster. Rather than re-implement all of the logic for Flow Fingerprinting based on JSON it made more sense and is simpler to just use the synchronization logic we already have for dealing with Versioned Components. These changes made it easier then to inherit a cluster flow, even if there are conflicts because this synchronization logic is more robust and includes starting/stopping components as necessary. Because of this change, now nodes will be able to rejoin even with conflicts so it didn't make sense to continue the requirement that the cluster cannot be updated if a node is not part of the cluster, so that check was removed. I looked at separating these changes out into separate Jiras/PRs but doing so would have greatly complicated things because of all of the interdependencies of these tasks, so I kept it all as a single PR. Below is a more comprehensive list of changes/improvements/refactorings that were necessary as part of this changeset:\r\n\r\n- Moved logic to synchronize Process Group with Versioned Process Group into a new ProcessGroupSynchronizer class instead of having all of the logic within StandardProcessGroup. This significantly improves readability and avoids importing things into the StandardProcessGroup that are not actually part of the ProcessGroup.\r\n- Reworked versioned components to use an instance id. This is important when synching an existing component to a cluster's component rather than a Versioned Flow.\r\n- Renamed StandardFlowSynchronizer to XmlFlowSynchronizer; introduced new StandardFlowSynchronizer that delegates to the appropriate (Xml or Versioned)FlowSynchronzer\r\n- Updated to allow import of VersionedProcessGroup even if not all bundles are available - will now use ghost components\r\n- Introduced a VersionedDataflow object to hold controller-level services, reporting tasks, parameter contexts, templates, etc.\r\n- Allow mutable requests to be made while nodes are disconnected. Also fixed issue in AbstractPolicyBasedAuthorizer that caused ClassNotFoundException / NoClassDefFoundError if the authorizations were changed and then a node attempts to rejoin the cluster. The Authorizer was attempting to use XmlUtils, which is in nifi-security-utils and so so by madking nifi-security-utils a provided dependency of nifi-framework-api, but this doesn't work, because nifi-framework-api is loaded by a higher-level classloader, so the classloader that loads AbstractPolicyBasedAuthorizer will never have the appropriate classloader to provide nifi-security-utils. Addressed this by copying the code for creating a safe document builder from XmlUtils to AbstractPolicyBasedAuthorizer.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n  contributor license agreements.

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9371 Removes the `synchronized` keyword from methods in `StandardProcessorNode` that interact with the `activeThreads` ConcurrentHashMap. As a result of changes in #5509 for NIFI-9365, the ConcurrentHashMap provides synchronization around changes to the collection of active threads, making the synchronization unnecessary at the method level.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include replacing several `System.out.println()` statements with SLF4J `Logger.info()` in `nifi-system-test-suite` classes.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is
