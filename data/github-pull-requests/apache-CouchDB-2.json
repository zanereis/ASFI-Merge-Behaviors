when replicator updated replication documents and the user overrode `couch_db:check_is_admin(Db)` such that the replicator app was not admin, the replicator would end up creating conflicts in the updated replicator docs. This was the result of running the after_doc_read/2 [1] callback, which would strip the credentials and then create a random RevId to replace the real RevId.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, make sure `after_doc_read/2` is skipped when it's the replicator application itself doing the doc reads. This is similar to what we do in the `before_doc_update/3` callback, so we just mirror the same behavior in `after_doc_read/2`.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in order to prevent users from pretending to be the replicator app by using the <<\"_replicator\">> role, switch the replicator role to be an atom --`replicator`. It's impossible for users to create atom roles, so this should ensure only replicator application can set that.\r\n\r\nHowever, just checking the `replicator` role is not enough to prevent conflicts. Since we're updating the docs on shard files directly (even for clustered databases) the internal replicator or the read_repair process may still read the documents via the `after_doc_read/2` callback and then proceed to update the patched doc body across the other copies. Thus, we skip the `after_doc_read/2` callback if it's called by the internal replicator.\r\n\r\nIn case of read_repair, there is nothing we can do to detect if the document we just read (interactively) may have been passed through the `after_doc_read/2` callback, so we opt to use only the internal replicator to spread `_replicator` changes between copies.\r\n\r\n[1] The `after_doc_read/2` callback is from a time when it was impossible to have multiple `_replicator` db and everyone was sharing a single db instance. In that case we added a feature so users cannot see each others' replication credentials unless they were admin or the \"owner\" of the replication doc. Today users may create their own `$prefix/_replicator` db, however, for compatibility we also maintain the `after_doc_read/2` callback (probably until CouchDB

Couch Stats Resource Tracker\r\n\r\nThis is a rework of PR: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4812\r\n\r\n## Overview and Motivation\r\n\r\nCouch Stats Resource Tracker (CSRT) is a new engine for tracking the amount of\r\nresource operations induced by processes within CouchDB's Erlang VM. This PR\r\nspecifically targets coordinator processes and RPC workers induced by said\r\ncoordinator processes, but the underlying stats collection framework is designed\r\nto be usable by anything consuming resources in CouchDB, such that we can extend\r\nthis out to background jobs like indexing, compaction, and replication. The long\r\nterm stretch goal is to be able to account for all system level activity induced\r\nby CouchDB, but the practical goal is to be able to understand where and why\r\nmost of the resources in the system are being utilized, at a request/job level\r\ngranularity.\r\n\r\nThis PR is primarily motivated by the current lack of visibility into\r\nidentifying _what_ operations are inducing large quantities of work. We have\r\nnode/cluster level visibility into the amounts of IO operations being induced,\r\nbut we lack the ability to identify what request/operation induced that\r\nworkload.\r\n\r\nThis is especially problematic when dealing with large fold operations that do\r\nlocal filtering (eg filtered `_changes` feeds or filtered `_find` queries)\r\nbecause these operations lack the normal coordinator induced rate limiting that\r\nresults naturally from funneling individual results back to the coordinator node\r\nto sort and process. In the local filtering case, we essentially do a direct\r\nfold over the shard and invoke a filter function on that doc to find a matching\r\nresult, but in the event the docs fail to match this is essentially a local\r\ntight loop over the shard that when run in parallel can easily dominate IO\r\noperations. The `_find` logic has been extended to generate `report`'s to log\r\nand identify the heavy hitter requests, especially the degenerative `_find`\r\nqueries that do a full database scan and find zero results to return.\r\n\r\n## Approach in this PR and differences from mango reports\r\n\r\nThis PR takes the idea of the mango reports and creates a unified framework for\r\ntracking these statistics in real time allowing for global querying of node and\r\ncluster level resource usage in the live processes. This PR reflexes an\r\nopinionated deviation from the approach in the mango reports, and instead of\r\nintroducing new stats tracking, it proposes the core approach of:\r\n\r\n> Any stat worth tracking for reporting system usage is clearly worth tracking\r\n> properly as a proper CouchDB metric.\r\n\r\nSo instead of embedding new stats like in the mango find reports, this system\r\nhooks into the `couch_stats:increment_counter` logic to piggy back off of the\r\nstats being collected in real time by the process doing the work, and then\r\nfunnels those updates into an ets table keyed off of the local process, and\r\njoined at a cluster level by the coordinator ref, allowing for cluster level\r\naggregation of individual http requests, live. These tracked stats are forwarded\r\nback to the coordinator process by way of embedding in the `rexi` RPC messages\r\nsuch that long running find queries and other heavy weight processes can be\r\nidentified and tracked.\r\n\r\nWe then log a report detailing the total resources induced by the http request\r\nso we can retroactively identify which requests are consuming the most\r\nresources. The reporting by default is configured to only happen at the\r\ncoordinator level, but if you're able to handle the log volume it can be enabled\r\nfor all workers too. Down the road a nice feature would be supporting writing\r\nreports directly to ClickHouse, some binary format, or even just a terse text\r\nformat to allow for increased report volumes; currently high throughput report\r\ngeneration for coordinator and all rpc workers on high Q databases is\r\nsubstantial in data volume, but there's much room for optimization given the\r\nverbose nature of the current reports and how well they gzip up.\r\n\r\n## New metrics introduced\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above mentioned philosophy of properly tracking the stats\r\nworth tracking, this PR introduces a handful of new stats, predominantly in one\r\nof two forms, listed below. I've also included sample screenshots of the new\r\nmetrics plotted during a 30 minute benchmark run that started with an empty\r\ncluster and aggressively created new databases/indexes/documents while growing\r\nworker count progressively during that run. All http traffic was ceased after 30\r\nminutes, and you can clearly see the phase change in operations when that\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n1) Core stats for previously missing metrics\r\n\r\neg new stats for counting `couch_btree` reads and writes on kp/kv nodes\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1422\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 5 53 42 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523ca54f-ad1c-4a04-8b45-de1c2af158e8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n2) RPC work induced\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that we should be tracking 1-3 things for all induced RPC work:\r\n\r\n  1) RPC worker spawned type\r\n  2) RPC worker docs processed\r\n  3) RPC worker docs returned\r\n\r\nItem 1) is the primary item for core RPC work, this allows us to see the volume\r\nof RPC workers spawned over time per node. Items 2) and 3) are specific to\r\naggregate operations, with 3) specific to aggregate operations that can perform\r\nlocal filtering.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that we can a) see the types of work being induced on nodes over\r\ntime, observe how much documents are being processed by the aggregate worker\r\noperations, and then b) directly observe major discrepancies between docs\r\nprocessed and docs returned, as that's indicative of a missing index or poorly\r\ndesigned workflows.\r\n\r\nHere's a full cluster view of all nodes rpc traffic:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1425\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 5 53 23 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79fc7f6e-143b-4a63-a518-c43297683733\">\r\n\r\nIn the case of our benchmark above, the workload was evenly distributed so all\r\nnodes performed similarly. This is a lot of data, but can easily be aggregated\r\nby node or type to identify non-homogeneous workloads. Here's a simpler view\r\nshowing per node RPC workloads:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1423\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 5 53 32 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f93ed420-66a1-4ce4-a86b-aec8632b6d7e\">\r\n\r\n \r\n## Tracking table for accumulating and querying metrics\r\n\r\nThe central tracking table is a global ets table utilizing `read_concurrency`,\r\n`write_concurrency`, and `distributed_counters`, which results in an\r\nimpressively performant global table in which all processes update their local\r\nstats. Writes are isolated to the process doing the work, so there is no\r\ncontention of parallel writes to the same key. Aggregations are performed\r\nagainst the full ets table, but updates are constrained to a given key are\r\nconstrained to the corresponding worker process.\r\n\r\n### Previous design that failed to scale\r\n\r\nIn previous PR I attempted to utilize a singular `gen_server` for monitoring the\r\nprocesses and performing some cleanup operations. This was optimized down to\r\n_only_ being a dedicated server doing `handle_call({monitor, Pid},..) ->\r\nmonitor_pid(), {reply, ok, State}). handle_info({DOWN, ..., REF, ...}) ->\r\nets:delete(maps:get(Ref, RefToPid))` and that was insufficient to handle the\r\nload. I tried various approaches but I was able to melt a singular `gen_server`\r\neasily. It's necessary to have a process monitor outside of the local process\r\nbecause coordinator/worker processes can and will get killed mid operation,\r\ntherefore `after` clause/function based approaches are insufficient.\r\n\r\nEven with that minimal of a workload, I was able to melt the `gen_server`:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"569\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 3 45 15 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d64327-f4ee-4ef8-a71c-48c3126c8099\">\r\n\r\nand that's with it _really_ doing a minimum workload:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"736\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 5 19 37 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d70f99c5-a984-4b35-aa80-aaee34d07e80\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was my final attempt to make a singular `gen_server` architecture, but with\r\n80 core nodes I'm now fully convinced it's no longer viable to do singular\r\n`gen_server` systems in hot code paths and we must take more distributed\r\napproaches, either by way of sharding the servers or fully distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Distributed tracker appraoch in CSRT v2\r\n\r\nIn the case of CSRT, I engaged a fully distributed approach that spawns a\r\ndedicated monitor process when a CSRT context is created by a coordinator or\r\nworker. This monitor process handles the lifetime of a given entry in the ets\r\ntable so that we delete the worker entry when the worker is done. This dedicated\r\nmonitor process also generates the report afterwards. Switching to the dedicated\r\nmonitor approach eliminated the scaling issues I encountered, and the current\r\narchitecture is able to readily handle max throughput load.\r\n\r\nThe CSRT context is created in the coordinator process directly in\r\n`chttpd:process_request_int`, and in the worker process directly in the\r\nspawned process's initialization of `rexi_server:init_p`. The context is\r\nbasically just `erlang:put(?CONTEXT_MARKER, {self(), make_ref()})` which is then\r\nthe ets key used for tracking the coordinator process while it handles the given\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nThe `make_ref()` ensures that the coordinator processes that are reused in the\r\nMochiweb worker pool distinguish between individual http requests. More\r\ngenerally, this allows a long lived process to isolate subsets of its own work.\r\nThis is essential if we want to add the ability to funnel the CSRT context\r\nthrough IOQ/couch_file/couch_mrview/etc to accumulate \r\n\r\n### A note on PidRef vs nonce for identification\r\n\r\nCurrently we don't funnel the coordinator's PidRef across the wire and instead\r\nrely on the `nonce` as a global aggregator key, and then the coordinator\r\naggregations happen directly when the RPC responses are received and the deltas\r\nare extracted. We could add this fairly easily in `rexi:cast_ref`, but I do\r\nwonder if we'd be better off skipping the ref entirely and instead using\r\n`{self(), Nonce}` as the key given we already funnel it around. That won't work\r\nfor background operations, so we'd need a `make_ref()` fallback for tracking\r\nthose jobs, but I do like the idea of consolidating down to using the `nonce`\r\ngiven it's already the unique reference to the request inducing the workload,\r\nand we already send it over the wire ubiquitously for all coordinator/worker\r\noperations through `rexi:cast_ref`.\r\n\r\n### Context creation and lifecycle\r\n\r\nWe create the initial context in\r\n`chttpd:process_request_int`/`rexi_server:init_p` for the coordinator/workers,\r\nrespectively, and then we progressively fill in the details for things like\r\ndbname/username/handler_fun so that we can track those data points naturally as\r\nthey arise in the request codepath, for example adding the chttp_db handler when\r\nentering those functions, or setting the username after `chttpd_auth:authorize`\r\nreturns. Similarly, in `fabric_rpc` we piggy back off of\r\n`fabric_rpc:set_io_priority` called by every callback function to cleanly set\r\nthe dbname involved in the RPC request. We could also extend this to track the\r\nddoc/index involved, if any.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to make it easy for the local process to update its global tracked\r\nstate at the appropriate points in the codebase so we can iteratively extend out\r\nthe tracking throughout the codebase. Background indexing and compaction are\r\napt targets for wiring in CSRT and we could even extend the `/_active_tasks`\r\njobs to include status about resource usage.\r\n\r\nWhen we initiate the context, for workers, coordinators, or any future job\r\ntypes, we spawn a dedicated tracking monitor process that sits by idly until it\r\ngets a `stop` message from normal lifecycle termination, or it gets a `DOWN`\r\nmessage from the process doing work. In either case, the tracker process cleans\r\nup the corresponding ets table entry (the only form of two processes writing to\r\nthe same key in the ets tracker, but handed off with no interweaving) and then\r\nconditionally generates a `report` to log the work induced.\r\n\r\nThe default, when CSRT is enabled, is to log a report for the coordinator\r\nprocess totalling the tracked work induced by the RPC workers to fulfill the\r\ngiven request. It's configurable to also log workers, and there's some\r\nrudimentary filtering capabilities to allow for logging of only a specific rpc\r\nworker type, but this could be improved upon considerably. In general, the\r\nvolume of these logs can be sizable, for example a singular http view request\r\nagainst a Q=64 database on a healthy cluster induces 196 RPC workers, all\r\ninducing their own volume of work and potentially logging a report. A compact\r\nform or additional filtering capabilities to log interesting reports would be\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\n## Status and next steps\r\n\r\nOverall I'm happy with the performance of the core tracking system, the modern\r\nETS improvements with distributed counters on top of atomic increments are\r\n_really_ impressive! I had the test suite fully passing recently but I've done a\r\ndecent bit of cleanup and restructuring recently so I haven't checked out a full\r\nCI run in a minute, I'll see how it looks on this PR and address anything that\r\ncomes up. I'd like to start getting a review here and see what folks think, I\r\nthink the structure of the code is in a good place to discuss and get feedback\r\non. A few next steps to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] add more tests\r\n- [ ] add Dialyzer specs `couch_stats_resource_tracker.erl` at the very least\r\n- [ ] fix `time` tracking, the `tnow()` is not a `positive_integer()`\r\n- [ ] add some standard query functions using ets:fun2ms\r\n  - The parse transform makes these more challenging to handle dynamically, so\r\n    let's add a handful of standard performant functions, eg:\r\n    - sort_by({dbname, shard, user}, ioq_calls)\r\n    - sort_by(user, ioq_calls)\r\n    - sort_by({user, request_type}, docs_processed)\r\n    - sort_by({request_type, user}, docs_processed)\r\n    - sort_by(user, get_kv_nodes)\r\n    - etc\r\n- [ ] think about additional filtering on logs:\r\n  - skip report fields with zero values?\r\n  - set minimum thresholds for reports?\r\n  - allow skipping of some coordinator reports? eg welcome handler\r\n- [ ] design on metrics namespacing from `rexi_server:init_p`\r\n  - eg `should_increment([M, F, spawned])` vs\r\n    - `should_increment([rexi_rpc, M, F, spawned]`\r\n    - or `should_increment([couchdb, rpc_worker, M, F, spawned]`\r\n\r\n## Sample report\r\n\r\nFiltered

Windows users decide to disable SpiderMonkey, it is likely the case they do not have it installed either.  In those scenarios it makes no sense to check for the presence of the static libraries.  Instead, `configure.ps1` fails to proceed untruly, which has to be fixed.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nOn Windows the following invocation of `configure.ps1` should just work when no SpiderMonkey is installed:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n.\\configure.ps1 -DisableSpiderMonkey\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the current version of [`apache/couchdb-glazier`](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-glazier) will just install SpiderMonkey unconditionally.  Before testing with that, it must be made sure that the SpiderMonkey installation is not

Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nThe `wait_tagged_idle_count/1` function already [performs an assertion](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/main/src/couch/test/eunit/couchdb_os_proc_pool.erl#L654) on the idle count, so the final `?assertEqual` is both redundant, and also apparently racy based on this test failure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n::in function couchdb_os_proc_pool:if_no_tagged_process_found_new_must_be_spawned/1 (test/eunit/couchdb_os_proc_pool.erl, line 397)\r\nin call from

latest version of Clouseau now fixes the incompatibility issue with OTP 26 and later (*), so pull that in and remove the related checks.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, replace SLF4J Simple with [Logback Classic](https://logback.qos.ch/) since that has been the standard logging backend for a while.  Note that Clouseau is still shipped with SLF4J API 1.7, which supports Logback up to 1.2 only.\r\n\r\n(*) Thanks @jaydoane!\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nConfigure with Clouseau enabled (UNIX-like systems, including macOS):\r\n\r\n```console\r\n./configure --with-clouseau\r\n```\r\n\r\nor on Windows:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n.\\configure.ps1 -WithClouseau\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRun the Mango tests (which should automatically utilize Clouseau):\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmake mango-test\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the Elixir search tests (which should automatically utilize Clouseau):\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmake elixir-search\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should all work with Erlang/OTP 25, 26, and 27.  However, Elixir (1.17.2) did not seem to work for me with OTP 27, but that is a different issue.  The Mango tests still passed for me on OTP 27.\r\n\r\nTo check if Logback works as expect, you can take a look at the contents of the `dev/logs/clouseau1.log` file after Clouseau has been started up alongside CouchDB, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```console\r\ndev/run -a adm:pass -n 1 --with-clouseau\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-16T11:53:07Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T16:08:36Z","closed_at":"2024-08-21T08:57:49Z","merged_at":"2024-08-21T08:57:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a617ed2f993a4166c96e90753600d83f37bd2e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/b721c5f60ac335a3c686c79f4f440933de6e6aff","head":{"label":"pgj:chore/clouseau/2.23.1","ref":"chore/clouseau/2.23.1","sha":"b721c5f60ac335a3c686c79f4f440933de6e6aff","user":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":589935401,"node_id":"R_kgDOIymzKQ","name":"couchdb","full_name":"pgj/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pgj/couchdb","description":"Seamless

calling insert multiple times for the same db, created multiple tree entries and only one map entry. Fix this by ensuring the cache can never be inconsistent as a result of performing any number of inserts or updates.\r\n\r\nThis should fix the function clause described in #5168. A detailed example on how this double insert leads to the function clause follows:\r\n\r\n * Calling insert twice for database `Db` might make the cache look something like this:\r\n```\r\n{gb_tree([{100, Db}, ..., {200, Db}, ...]), #{..., Db => 200, ...}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n * During traversal when closing, if the first entry (100) is idle, we'd try to update it (bump it). But when bumping, we'd pick out `200` as the key to delete from the `Tree`, instead of 100! So we'd delete 200 and may bump to some higher number like `300`.\r\n\r\n * To recap, at this point the iterator would be stopped at `{100, Db}` with the rest of iterator tree looking like `[..., {200, Db}, ...]` and the `Tree` accumulator will look something like `[{100, Db}, ..., {300, Db}, ...]`.\r\n\r\n * The iterator continues traversing and reaches the `{200, Db}` entry. If it's idle, it will try to delete it from the `Tree`.

`couch_lru` could crash with a ```function_clause gb_trees:delete_1(...,nil)``` error, indicating that we tried to remove an non-existent entry from the tree. That happened because we were updating the cache, which updated the tree object from it, but traversing iterator was not updated. As a result the two trees got out of \"sync\" and entries we were expecting to be there were now gone.\r\n\r\nThe solution, as suggested by Russell, is to just create a new iterator if from the updated cache.\r\n\r\nWe further observed that as a result of this fix, the iterator itself became un-necessary, since every path through the function updates the tree, so required creating a new iterator. As a result it makes sense to just fetch the next key value pair with [larger/2](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gb_trees.html#larger/2). Because `larger/2` is present in OTP 27+ only, create local compat function until then.\r\n\r\nAlso take the opportunity to replace the dict with maps, to hopefully get a gain a bit of performance.\r\n\r\nCo-author: Russell Branca\r\nCo-author: Robert Newson\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-02T22:52:18Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T16:20:26Z","closed_at":"2024-08-03T22:33:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a16971215349f9d56725fcfb28150790581aba80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5165/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5165/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5165/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/530297be874ca14db9210f9a1dcf06bbf9ffeaea","head":{"label":"apache:fix-gb-trees-function-clause-in-couch-lru","ref":"fix-gb-trees-function-clause-in-couch-lru","sha":"530297be874ca14db9210f9a1dcf06bbf9ffeaea","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

we performed cleanup only for specific errors such as `ddoc_updated`, and `insufficient_storage`. In case of other errors, or timeouts, there was a chance we would leak workers waiting to be either started or canceled. Those workers would then wait around until the 5 minute rexi timeout fires, and then they emit an error in the logs. It's not a big deal as that happens on errors only, and the processes are all waiting in receive, however, they do hold a Db handle open, so they can waste resources from that point of view.\r\n\r\nTo fix that, this commit extends cleanup to other errors and timeouts.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in case of timeouts, we log fabric worker timeout errors. In order to do that we export the `fabric_streams` internal `#stream_acc` record to every `fabric_streams` user. That's a bit untidy, so make the timeout error return the defunct workers only, and so, we can avoid leaking the `#stream_acc` record outside the fabric_streams module.\r\n\r\nRelated to
