Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, when users want to use the cold hot separation feature, they need to create resource first and then use created resource to create storage policies. However, for some historical reasons, the BE side will save the properties of resource in the `StoragePolicy`, and construct a `FileSystem` object for each storage policy, store the `FileSystem` object with storage policy name as key in global `FileSystemMap`. For the cooldowned remote rowsets, the storage policy name is recorded to find the location of the data in remote storage. The disadvantages of this design are:\r\n1. Multiple storage policies are likely to use the same resource, but BE will construct `FileSystem` objects for each storage policy, resulting in a waste of memory resources.\r\n2. FE drop storage policy will cause the cooldowned rowset to be unable to find the remote path through the storage policy name, resulting in data loss. It is more appropriate for rowset to index the remote path through the resource id.\r\n3. The inconsistency between BE's implementation and FE semantics of storage policy may lead to difficulties in future development and maintenance.\r\n\r\nNote that because the value stored by rowset to locate the remote storage is changed from storage policy name to resource id, the data cooldowned by the storage policy in the previous versions cannot be accessed, which means this PR does not consider compatibility of cold hot feature with previous versions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the mechanism for FE to synchronize storage policies to BE has been updated to reduce network overhead. BE periodic report tablets with resources and storage policies in BE's memory, and FE receives the tablet report from BE, then calculates the difference of resources and storage policies between BE and FE, and sends these diffs to BE for synchronization.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #15850 \r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nAfter opening the project in Intellij Idea, we can see the cause. It is because Apache Maven of which the version is 3.8.1 or newer blocks http repositories by default. Therefore, we can fix this issue by adding a https repository which contains this package in `pom.xml`.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\norg.pentaho:pentaho-aggdesigner-algorithm:pom:5.1.5-jhyde failed to transfer from http://0.0.0.0/ during a previous attempt. This failure was cached in the local repository and resolution is not reattempted until the update interval of maven-default-http-blocker has elapsed or updates are forced. Original error: Could not transfer artifact org.pentaho:pentaho-aggdesigner-algorithm:pom:5.1.5-jhyde from/to maven-default-http-blocker (http://0.0.0.0/): Blocked mirror for repositories: [datanucleus (http://www.datanucleus.org/downloads/maven2, default, releases), glassfish-repository (http://maven.glassfish.org/content/groups/glassfish, default, disabled), glassfish-repo-archive (http://maven.glassfish.org/content/groups/glassfish, default, disabled), apache.snapshots (http://repository.apache.org/snapshots, default, snapshots)]\r\n\r\nSince Maven 3.8.1 http repositories are blocked.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n- Check that Maven settings.xml does not contain http repositories\r\n- Check that Maven pom files do not contain http repository http://www.datanucleus.org/downloads/maven2\r\n- Check that Maven pom files do not contain http repository http://maven.glassfish.org/content/groups/glassfish\r\n- Check that Maven pom files do not contain http repository http://maven.glassfish.org/content/groups/glassfish\r\n- Check that Maven pom files do not contain http repository http://repository.apache.org/snapshots\r\n- Add a mirror(s) for http://www.datanucleus.org/downloads/maven2, http://maven.glassfish.org/content/groups/glassfish, http://maven.glassfish.org/content/groups/glassfish, http://repository.apache.org/snapshots that allows http url in the Maven settings.xml\r\n- Downgrade Maven to version 3.8.1 or earlier in settings\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-12T04:01:14Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T14:16:37Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T12:25:54Z","merged_at":"2023-01-17T12:25:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d863a18c35b231bf8341526397808ef03993b22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4975604266,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBfSlxs8AAAABKJGyKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/dev/1.2.2-merged","name":"dev/1.2.2-merged","color":"0AC704","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/15851/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/15851/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/15851/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/9d056989ac638123fd56e88eb2a3a7bf7abfb64f","head":{"label":"adonis0147:regression","ref":"regression","sha":"9d056989ac638123fd56e88eb2a3a7bf7abfb64f","user":{"login":"adonis0147","id":1443003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147","html_url":"https://github.com/adonis0147","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444722431,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoHs_w","name":"doris","full_name":"adonis0147/doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adonis0147","id":1443003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147","html_url":"https://github.com/adonis0147","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adonis0147/doris","description":"Apache

Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ✓] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ✓] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ✓] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ✓] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ✓] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\nThis PR is one part of our bulk load implementation, which provide the tool to build the segment file of a tablet in an external way.\r\nIt's support build local and HDFS, which means you need provide the meta file and the data file like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./segment_builder --meta_file=/path/to/hdr/88409.hdr --data_path=/path/to/data/file --format=parquet --is_remote=false\r\n\r\nll /path/to/data/file\r\nxxx1..gz.parquet\r\nxxx2..gz.parquet\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIf the file all from the HDFS, the path should be the HDFS path. Currently only support parquet.\r\n\r\nSince from internal we use the privately-owned HDFS lib, **so this PR HDFS related code may not work**.  I don't have such open source HDFS environment to test it.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10161171/211814188-f70afdd1-b973-48cc-be7e-db39dc5a036a.png)\r\n\r\nFrom above picture you can see the final work flow:\r\n1. Read the hdr file from the meta path, do some validation and system initialization.\r\n2. Build the HDFS scanner, and read the parquet file from HDFS directly, and generate the segment file on local disk.\r\n3. At last upload the segment file to HDFS, same path with the hdr file, and all these files will be used by the load segment statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n(@morningman edit)\r\nI sorted out the main process for easy review:\r\n\r\n1. `BuilderHelper::initial_build_env()`\r\n\r\n\tInitialize some objects necessary to start a BE instance\r\n\r\n2. `BuilderHelper::open()`\r\n\r\n\tOpen the `StorageEngine` object. And check that the relevant directories are correct, etc.\r\n\r\n3. `BuilderHelper::build()`\r\n\r\n\t1. Read header file from HDFS or local file\r\n\t2. Generate `TabletMeta` and `Tablet` object according to header\r\n\t3. Collect the list of data files that need to be read\r\n\t4. Create `BuilderScannerMemtable` and call `doSegmentBuild(files)`\r\n\r\n\t\t1. Generate `BrokerScanNode` and initialize it.\r\n\t\t2. Generate `DeltaWriter` and initialize it\r\n\t\t3. Loop through the `BrokerScanNode` to read the file and write to the `DeltaWriter`\r\n\t\t4. When the reading is complete, close the `DeltaWriter`\r\n\t\t5. Call `revise_rs_metas` to modify `tablet_meta`\r\n\r\n\t5. After the writing is completed, a new header file is generated\r\n\t6. Upload segment file and header file to HDFS if

and **Sort**, which time cost is O(log(n)), I don't think it's a good way.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to insert data into memtable:\r\n\r\n1. insert into skiplist: **O(log(n))**, when need flush, the data is already sorted\r\n2. insert into a block(append only): **O(1)**, when need flush, sort once.\r\n\r\nthis pr implement way2 for duplicate table: **append data to a block and sort when need

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\njava-udf-jar-with-dependencies.jar is almost 400MB, because it depends on fe-core, so it will\r\ncontains all jars in fe-core, which is too large.\r\n\r\nActually, java udf jar is only depends on Type related class in fe-core, so I moved these classes\r\nto fe-common, so that java udf jar can only depends on fe-common.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the size of jar reduce from 358M to 90MB\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAs part of [Inverted Index DSIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DORIS/DSIP-023%3A+Add+inverted+index+for+full+text+search) steps, we'd like to contribute our inverted index implementations step by step.\r\nFirst of all we need to introduce clucene to doris thirdparty libs, because inverted index implementations are based on lucence API and index file format, also we add our features and performance improvements base on clucene, so we need to maintain the repo ourselves\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n##

and **Sort**, which time cost is O(log(n)), I don't think it's a good way.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to insert data into memtable:\r\n\r\n1. insert into skiplist: **O(log(n))**, when need flush, the data is already sorted\r\n2. insert into a block(append only): **O(1)**, when need flush, sort once.\r\n\r\nthis pr implement way2 for duplicate table: **append data to a block and sort when need

segment (#14174)\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: freemandealer <freeman.zhang1992@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n# Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCheck will fail because _segid_statistics_map.find(_num_segcompacted) == _segid_statistics_map.end().\r\nHere the check is ensuring _segid_statistics_map has no existing entry indexed by _num_segcompacted.\r\n\r\nWhen will _segid_statistics_map add an entry? The answer is:\r\n\r\nafter a segment is flushed, or\r\nafter segcompacting, or\r\nafter renaming the big segments which need not segcompact.\r\nWe note a segment that has never been played by segcompaction as 'raw_seg'. When these raw segments are compacted, their records will be erased from _segid_statistics_map and 'new_seg' (compacted results) will be added to the map as a replacement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nFor 7 raw segments 'oooOOoo' ('O' for the big segment while 'o' for the small), we break it into four parts: 1) ooo , 2)O, 3)O, 4)oo.\r\nGroup 1 will be compacted to form 'new_seg_1-3', and raw_seg_1, raw_seg_2, raw_seg_3 are wiped out.\r\nGroup 2 will be renamed from 'raw_seg_4' to 'new_seg_2' and add it to the map.\r\nGroup 3 will be renamed from 'raw_seg_5' to 'new_seg_3' and add it to the map.\r\nGroup 4 will be compacted to form 'new_seg_6-7', and raw_seg_6, raw_seg_7 are wiped out.\r\nFinally, we rename 'new_seg_1-3' to 'new_seg_1' and 'new_seg_6-7' to 'new_seg_4'. So we end up having new_seg_1, new_seg_2, new_seg_3, and new_seg_4.\r\n\r\nBut for those who start with one or more big segments, the problem happens.\r\nTake 'OOoooo' as an example. We break them into 3 groups: 1) O, 2) O, 3) oooo.\r\nGroup 1 will be renamed from 'raw_seg_1' to 'new_seg_1' and add it to the map. Coz it is the first segment that is big, filenames get lined up -- src filename & dst filename are the same (ignore the raw/new sign that are only used to distinguish in this comment).\r\n\r\nThe case should be carefully handled. We do not need to actually rename it but we should count it as handled. If we miss counting (increase _num_segcompacted), the following group 2 will still want to be renamed as 'new_seg_1', but 'new_seg_1' is already in the map, causing the check to fail at last.\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n~~Issue Number: close #xxx~~\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nOn macOS, we need some extra libraries to build the codebase, therefore two packages were introduced to the project. They are `binutils` and `gettext`. \r\n\r\nIt takes a lot of time to build these packages completely. This PR introduces a way to build the needed libraries and other stuff are skipped to build. It can save the time to build the third-party libraries on macOS.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nIn #15037, I modified the build script of libgsasl to enable GSSAPI,\r\nbut it is still wrong, because the PATH does not include the `thirdparty/installed/bin`,\r\nso when building libgsasl, it will report error:\r\n`WARNING: MIT Kerberos krb5-config not found, disabling GSSAPI`\r\n\r\nbut `krb5-config` is in `thirdparty/installed/bin`.\r\n\r\nWithout GSSAPI, the libhdfs3 can not access hdfs with kerberos authentication.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick
