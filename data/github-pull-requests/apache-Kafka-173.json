KAFKA-3857\n\nChanges proposed in this pull request:\n\nThe following additional log cleaner metrics have been added.\n1. num-runs: Cumulative number of successful log cleaner runs since last broker restart.\n2. last-run-time: Time of last log cleaner run.\n3. num-filthy-logs: Number of filthy logs. A non zero value for an extended period of time indicates that the cleaner has not been successful in cleaning the logs.\n\nA note on num-filthy-logs: It is incremented whenever a filthy topic partition is added to inProgress HashMap. And it is decremented once the cleaning is successful, or if the cleaning is aborted. Note that the existing LogCleaner code does not provide a metric to check if the clean operation is successful or not. There is an inProgress HashMap with topicPartition  => LogCleaningInProgress entries in it, but the entries are removed from the HashMap even when clean operation throws an exception. So, added an additional metric num-filthy-logs, to differentiate between a successful log clean case and an exception case.\n\nThe code is ready. I have tested and verified JMX metrics. There is one case I couldn't test though. It's the case where numFilthyLogs is decremented in 'resumeCleaning(...)' in LogCleanerManager.scala Line 188. It seems to be a part of the workflow that aborts the cleaning of a particular partition. Any ideas on how to test this

patch fixes two issues:\n1. Subsequent regex subscriptions fail with the new consumer.\n2. Subsequent regex subscriptions would not immediately refresh metadata to change the subscription of the new consumer and trigger a rebalance.\n\nThe final note on the JIRA stating that a later created topic that matches a consumer's subscription pattern would not be assigned to the consumer upon creation seems to be as designed. A repeat \n`subscribe()` to the same pattern or some wait time until the next automatic metadata refresh would handle that case.\n\nAn integration test was also added to verify these issues are fixed

After calling MemoryRecords.close() method, hasRoomFor() method should return false.\n\nThis is a backport to the 0.9.0

worker nodes, the TaskIds they are carrying with) is not changed, we really just want to keep the old task assignment.\n\nAdd the code to check whether the node topology is changing or not:\n- when the prevAssignedTasks from the old clientStates is the same as the new task list\n- when there is no new node joining (its prevAssignTasks would be either empty or conflict with some other nodes)\n- when there is no node dropping out (the total of prevAssignedTasks from other nodes would not be equal to the new task list)\n\nWhen the topology is not changing, we would just use the old mapping.\n\nI also added the code to check whether the previous assignment is balanced (whether each node's task list is within [1/2 average -- 2 \\* average]), if it's not balanced, we will still start the a new task assignment.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T23:14:25Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T11:42:27Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T22:20:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e3c7ca9c5c2f46fd37a7f6887dc811ff3c5c862","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/1543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/1543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/720bbdf1785b79a299499eccbc17dec84804849f","head":{"label":"HenryCaiHaiying:upstream","ref":"upstream","sha":"720bbdf1785b79a299499eccbc17dec84804849f","user":{"login":"HenryCaiHaiying","id":7378943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzg5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7378943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying","html_url":"https://github.com/HenryCaiHaiying","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56541090,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjU0MTA5MA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"HenryCaiHaiying/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HenryCaiHaiying","id":7378943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzg5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7378943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying","html_url":"https://github.com/HenryCaiHaiying","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryCaiHaiying/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HenryCaiHaiying/kafka","description":"Mirror

believe this will cause clients to defensively prune their cluster metadata in all cases. It doesn't address why a client without a Pattern subscription would receive a response containing all topics and partitions for the cluster (which is still undesirable, but I am guessing would require a fix for the broker.)\n\nIn my own testing, this restored the amount of heap required to 0.8 consumer levels.\n\nI am concerned that I do not 100% understand all the uses of this class. My assumption is that only topics that have been added are expected in the response and that the two unit test modifications I needed to make were oversights.\n\nI am also assuming that this behavior was only applied to the pattern matching case to avoid a small amount of (presumed) unnecessary work and not for correctness reasons.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T20:24:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T20:49:52Z","closed_at":"2016-06-22T20:49:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3a6e4ee14b6c11d1e952a5fd394a96ffa6a1582","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/1541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/1541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bf4f316d0478c417d045b3f25fc5bbe585d6e7b9","head":{"label":"spredfast:remove-extra-metadata","ref":"remove-extra-metadata","sha":"bf4f316d0478c417d045b3f25fc5bbe585d6e7b9","user":{"login":"spredfast","id":521232,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjUyMTIzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/521232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast","html_url":"https://github.com/spredfast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":10821732,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgyMTczMg==","name":"kafka-1","full_name":"spredfast/kafka-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"spredfast","id":521232,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjUyMTIzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/521232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast","html_url":"https://github.com/spredfast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spredfast/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/spredfast/kafka-1","description":"Mirror
