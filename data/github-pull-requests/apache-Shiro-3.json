href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.9 - 24 Sep 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.8 - 19 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2483\">#2483</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.7 - 13 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2471\">#2471</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.6 - 29 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2449\">#2449</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.8 - 19 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2483\">#2483</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.7 - 13 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2471\">#2471</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.6 - 29 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2449\">#2449</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning.

<strong>Hazelcast IMDG 4.0</strong>.</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n</table>\n<h1>New Features</h1>\n<h2>Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise New Features:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Persistent Memory Integration:</strong> Added support for persistent memory, such as Intel(R) Optane(TM) DC, to be  used by Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store feature. See the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/index.html#using-persistent-memory\">Using Persistent Memory section</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encrypting Data in Hot Restart Store:</strong> Provided a framework and implementation to encrypt data in Hot Restart stores (&quot;at rest&quot;) for data held in distributed structures. See the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#encryption-at-rest\">Encryption at Rest section</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>X.509 Certificate Authentication:</strong> Added support for credential retrieval by the members from the X.509 certificates configured on the clients. See the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#tls-authentication-type\">Security chapter</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Out of the Box LDAP Configuration:</strong> Introduced a new LDAP login module where you do not need to provide your own JAAS login module for this purpose. See the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#ldap-authentication-type\">Security chapter</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CP Subsystem Persistence:</strong> Implemented persistency for Hazelcast's CP (Consistency &amp; Partition Tolerance) subsystem. See the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#cp-subsystem-persistence\">CP Subsystem Persistence section</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hazelcast IMDG Open Source New Features:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CP Subsystem Development Mode:</strong> Introduced <code>UNSAFE</code> mode for the CP data structures. This way, you do not need to have at least three IMDG members to use CP subsystem: you can benefit from its functionalities using only one or two members. See the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#cp-subsystem-unsafe-mode\">CP Subsystem Unsafe Mode section</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bitmap Indexes:</strong> Introduced this feature to significantly lower index memory usage for low-cardinality columns and also to speed up the queries and lower memory requirements for them when the queries have multiple predicates acting on the same bitmap index. Note that bitmap indexes usage, currently, is a good fit for array/collection attribute indexing, rather than regular single-valued attributes. See the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#bitmap-indexes\">Bitmap Indexes section</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<h2>Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separating WAN Publisher Configuration:</strong> The previously known <code>wan-publisher</code> (or <code>WanPublisherConfig</code>) has been separated into two configuration elements to be used for built-in and custom WAN publishers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>batch-publisher</code> (or <code>WanBatchPublisherConfig</code>)</li>\n<li><code>custom-publisher</code>  (or <code>WanCustomPublisherConfig</code>)\nSee the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/index.html#defining-wan-replication\">Defining WAN Replication section</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tracking WAN Synchronization Events:</strong> Management Center, logs and diagnostics now report the progress of a WAN synchronization. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15221\">#15221</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improvements in the JAAS Authentication Mechanism:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aligned with JAAS best practices.</li>\n<li>Added support for the standard JAAS callbacks, i.e., <code>NameCallback</code> and <code>PasswordCallback</code></li>\n<li>Avoided automatic deserialization of custom credentials in the client protocol.</li>\n<li>Introduce the concept of security roles to distinguish between (a single) connecting side identity and its privileges.</li>\n<li>Used <code>Credentials</code> object only for authentication to prevent secrets leaks.</li>\n<li>Cleaned up the <code>Credentials</code> interface.\nSee the <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#jaas-authentication\">JAAS Authentication section</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improvements in the Security Configuration:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replaced the <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> configuration by simple <code>&lt;cluster-name&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed the <code>group-password</code> configuration.</li>\n<li>Introduced the concept of security realms on the members. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15651\">#15651</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.7 - 13 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2471\">#2471</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.6 - 29 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2449\">#2449</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.6 - 29 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2449\">#2449</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning. The system call is now disabled for these machines. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2434\">#2434</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.3 - 19 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the CodeQL Action could not write diagnostic messages on Windows. This issue did not impact analysis quality. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2430\">#2430</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.2 - 14 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2417\">#2417</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.1 - 13 Aug 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported. Please migrate to a macOS runner if this affects you. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2403\">#2403</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2408\">#2408</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385\">#2385</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dependabot-action\"><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2376\">#2376</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning. The system call is now disabled for these machines. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2434\">#2434</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.3 - 19 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the CodeQL Action could not write diagnostic messages on Windows. This issue did not impact analysis quality. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2430\">#2430</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.2 - 14 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2417\">#2417</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.1 - 13 Aug 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported. Please migrate to a macOS runner if this affects you. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2403\">#2403</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2408\">#2408</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385\">#2385</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dependabot-action\"><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2376\">#2376</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server.
