SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change the behavior of our UI. Originally, we had the switch and the rest of the form fields as part of the SSHTunnelForm, however, that stops us from extending the behavior of the switch itself if needed. With these changes we introduce a new registry extension and make use of it if provided. Also we add a new test to cover such scenario.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Implement a new extension and place it in the new registry\r\n2. Provide such extension to the frontend\r\n3. Your extension of the switch should be displayed and not the default one\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a continuation of #22945 to clean up the pivot and rename operators. Since generic x-axis relies on using `series_columns` to distinguish which columns are used for series groupings, we should always first check if `series_columns` is populated, and only afterwards check for `columns`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSomewhat akin to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22413, this PR optimizes the PUT operation for the RESTful API `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` endpoint.\r\n\r\nThough updates are sparse in nature, i.e., per [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/21a2e7bc91125ffab2ddc62d6cee7a7e9a51840d/superset/dao/base.py#L166-L167) where only the specified properties are updated, from a dataset perspective all the columns and metrics must be specified‚Äîeven if one is only updating a subset‚Äîotherwise the undefined (unseen) columns and metrics will be deleted per [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/21a2e7bc91125ffab2ddc62d6cee7a7e9a51840d/superset/datasets/dao.py#L221-L222) and [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/21a2e7bc91125ffab2ddc62d6cee7a7e9a51840d/superset/datasets/dao.py#L262-L263) respectively.\r\n\r\nFor large datasets (like Airbnb's uber virtual dataset‚Äîcomprising of thousands of columns and metrics) these updates are rather expensive (and thus slow) given that the create, update, and delete operations work‚Äîcourtesy of a for loop‚Äîon a single entity (which could be sparse in nature) at a time. In our production environment this request times out as NGINX is configured with a 300 second (5 minute) timeout.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is to use bulk logic (courtesy of SQLAlchemy) for the create, update, and delete operations which significantly improves the performance, i.e., for the dataset in question (with sparsely defined columns/metrics containing only the minimum attributes, i.e., name, ID, etc.) the time for the PUT operation for the RESTful API `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` endpoint reduced from ~ 590 seconds to ~ 45 seconds‚Äîa ~ 1,200% increase in performance.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.

SUMMARY\r\nIn existing code, there is a consensus that the cte alias should be '__cte'.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a few problems.\r\n1. cte_alias is defined in multiple places in the code, both in [base.py](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b410dbb5dd510f1ed1dce6b2d0e114dda263eedb/superset/db_engine_specs/base.py#L89) and [helpers.py](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b410dbb5dd510f1ed1dce6b2d0e114dda263eedb/superset/models/helpers.py#L101)\r\n2. Developers of DB engine specs cannot specify their own cte_alias.\r\n\r\nMy fix:\r\n1. Change base.py and make cte_alias an attribute of BaseEngineSpec\r\n2. Make all other usages of cte_alias refre back to the engine spec.\r\n\r\nThis will solve the outlined problems because\r\n1. All changes to CTE_ALIAS will now be automatically propagated\r\n2.  Developers can now overwrite cte_alias in their db_engine_spec\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate chart from dataset that has a CTE\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes two issue with virtual dataset duplication:\r\n- Any calculated columns become non-calculated columns in the duplicated dataset.  The calculated column name becomes the non-calculated column name, which is likely not an actual column on the data and the column is therefore invalid.  The SQL is lost and syncing columns from source deletes them (unless their names correspond to actual columns on the table.\r\n- All columns have their descriptions removed.\r\n\r\nThese issues were caused by the duplication command not passing the `expression` or `description` fields when creating the new DB objects for the columns in the duplicated dataset.  This PR passes those fields.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/216119858-0889c5d4-2689-452b-b631-919bcb73a0c3.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/216119881-bfe5b345-0d97-41bc-9798-5a61e97240a0.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Create a virtual dataset with:\r\n  - A non-calculated column w/o a description\r\n  - A non-calculated column w/ a description\r\n  - A calculated columns w/o a description\r\n  - A non-calculated column w/ a description\r\n- Duplicate the dataset and confirm that all columns were duplicated correctly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user applied a time range native filter, the filter would not call \"unfocus\" action (in Chrome) or \"unhover\" action (in Safari) which caused the charts not in scope of that filter to stay greyed out.\r\nThis PR fixes that behaviour by manually calling those actions after clicking \"Save\" or \"Cancel\" buttons in the time range modal.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/216053067-b16c17fd-aad2-4c64-aa26-1502e56890e9.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/216053089-413e25a8-75ef-48d2-ae84-eaa2b14ee41c.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add 2 charts compatible with time filters to a dashboard\r\n2. Add a time range filter that has only 1 of added charts in scope\r\n3. Set the filter and close the modal\r\n4. Verify that both charts are not greyed out\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

(:issue:`2702`)\n<h2>v4.4.3 (2023-01-30)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.3\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tox will now expand self-referential extras discovered in package deps to respect local modifications to package\nmetadata. This allows a package extra to explicitly depend on another package extra, which previously only worked with\nnon-static metadata - by :user:<code>masenf</code>. (:issue:<code>2904</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.4.2 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.2</p>\n<pre><code>- Allow the user configuration file (default ``&lt;appdir&gt;/tox/config.ini``) to be overridden via the\n  ``TOX_USER_CONFIG_FILE`` environment variable. Previously tox was looking at the ``TOX_CONFIG_FILE`` to override the\n  user configuration, however that environment variable is already used to override the main configuration - by\n  :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2890`)\n<h2>v4.4.1 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.1\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In tox 4.4.0 <code>constrain_package_deps</code> was introduced with a default value of <code>True</code>.

see! üò¨ \r\n>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/215923574-d68f971d-1a8c-468b-92f9-9f16a11d9b16.png)\r\n\r\nIn a recent release, we noticed a significant regression in CSV downloads from SQL Lab, where people who used to download hundreds of thousands of rows of results within our 5 minute webserver timeout were no longer able to. After digging into datadog traces, I saw that gunicorn was killing the process it was stuck here:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/215923746-697c5e1a-2c6e-4b89-8c8c-0349c59e38c5.png)\r\n\r\nLooking into the code, this is in the middle of a scary O(N^2) loop that iterates through every cell of the csv output (which as mentioned before could be on the order of millions of cells) and escapes string values if necessary: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/utils/csv.py#L42-L80\r\n\r\nSo something changed in performance here, and after digging in further, I noticed that we upgraded pandas in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22217. Since in every loop we update a value in a dataframe in pandas, I took a trip over to the pandas repo and found this issue reporting a performance regression in 1.5.1 (we upgraded to 1.5.2) where someone was also updating a dataframe in a loop: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/49729. This issue was resolved with the fix backported to 1.5.3, thus this PR upgrades pandas to 1.5.3.\r\n\r\nI sure hope this works.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI\r\n\r\nto: @john-bodley @ktmud

This allows a package extra to explicitly depend on another package extra, which previously only worked with\n  non-static metadata - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2904`)\n<h2>v4.4.2 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.2\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow the user configuration file (default <code>&lt;appdir&gt;/tox/config.ini</code>) to be overridden via the\n<code>TOX_USER_CONFIG_FILE</code> environment variable. Previously tox was looking at the <code>TOX_CONFIG_FILE</code> to override the\nuser configuration, however that environment variable is already used to override the main configuration - by\n:user:<code>masenf</code>. (:issue:<code>2890</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.4.1 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.1</p>\n<pre><code>- In tox 4.4.0 ``constrain_package_deps`` was introduced with a default value of ``True``. This has been changed back to\n  ``False``, which restores the original behavior of tox 4.3.5 - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2897`)\n<h2>v4.4.0 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Features - 4.4.0\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Test environments now recognize boolean config keys <code>constrain_package_deps</code> (default=true) and <code>use_frozen_constraints</code> (default=false),\nwhich control how tox generates and applies constraints files when performing <code>install_package_deps</code>.</p>\n<p>If <code>constrain_package_deps</code> is true (default), then tox will write out <code>{env_dir}{/}constraints.txt</code> and pass it to\n<code>pip</code> during <code>install_package_deps</code>. If <code>use_frozen_constraints</code> is false (default), the constraints will be taken\nfrom the specifications listed under <code>deps</code> (and inside any requirements or constraints file referenced in <code>deps</code>).\nOtherwise, <code>list_dependencies_command</code> (<code>pip freeze</code>) is used to enumerate exact package specifications which will\nbe written to the constraints file.</p>\n<p>In previous releases, conflicting package dependencies would silently override the <code>deps</code> named in the configuration,\nresulting in test runs against unexpected dependency versions, particularly when using tox factors to explicitly test\nwith different versions of dependencies - by :user:<code>masenf</code>. (:issue:<code>2386</code>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.0</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes 5 warnings in `superset-frontend/src/explore/components/controls/FilterControl/AdhocFilterOption/AdhocFilterOption.test.tsx`. There was one act error and the other four were because the tests needed a redux provider. I also changed the tests to use `useDnd` from Superset's test helper's `render` function instead of wrapping the provider in the setup function.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- cd into `superset-frontend`\r\n- run `npm run test superset-frontend/src/explore/components/controls/FilterControl/AdhocFilterOption/AdhocFilterOption.test.tsx`\r\n- Observe that only one warning is left in the test.\r\n  - There were 6 warnings initially\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR bundles a few miscellaneous updates for the Table component:\r\n- Enables use of the `rowKey` prop from the AntD table.  This prop allows the user to specify a selector string (property name) or selector function to identify/return the key for each table row given the row's record object.  Without it, all row records must contain a unique `key` property.\r\n- Adds documentation to Storybook about cell content selectors and page indexing.\r\n- Fixes a potentially-invalid CSS line.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- These updates don't have user-facing implications, but feel free to proofread the updated Storybook page.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is

SUMMARY\r\nWhen any random user clones a dashboard without clone charts, the original owner of the chart cannot update the chart.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"806\" alt=\"Notification_Center\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/215570499-d3960798-7f11-4d4b-8e29-95170747e5ba.png\">\r\n\r\n> For example, create a chart and link to two dashboards owned by different users. Set the dashboard who owned by the secondary owner to draft. Update the chart by the primary owner.\r\n> Please see the [test spec](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22896/files#diff-8b0aeaa2773ac70adc8318be6818e75848e8da5f6ee05838dda7c92c2ad29ed4R707-R732) for this example\r\n\r\nIt's caused by the #21497 which starts passing the linked `dashboards` ids and the following validation logic triggered.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/7bd2afd724799be2d5ca3edb90c5b95a56609211/superset/charts/commands/update.py#L107-L110\r\n\r\nThe main problem is base `find_by_ids` applies `base_filter` which excludes the dashboard without ownership under draft status. (see the following logs)\r\n\r\n```\r\nsuperset_app           | SELECT dashboards.uuid AS dashboards_uuid, dashboards.created_on AS dashboards_created_on, dashboards.changed_on AS dashboards_changed_on, dashboards.id AS dashboards_id, dashboards.dashboard_title AS dashboards_dashboard_title, dashboards.position_json AS dashboards_position_json, dashboards.description AS dashboards_description, dashboards.css AS dashboards_css, dashboards.certified_by AS dashboards_certified_by, dashboards.certification_details AS dashboards_certification_details, dashboards.json_metadata AS dashboards_json_metadata, dashboards.slug AS dashboards_slug, dashboards.published AS dashboards_published, dashboards.is_managed_externally AS dashboards_is_managed_externally, dashboards.external_url AS dashboards_external_url, dashboards.created_by_fk AS dashboards_created_by_fk, dashboards.changed_by_fk AS dashboards_changed_by_fk\r\nsuperset_app           | FROM dashboards\r\nsuperset_app           | WHERE dashboards.id IN (__[POSTCOMPILE_id_1]) AND (dashboards.id IN (SELECT dashboards.id\r\nsuperset_app           | FROM dashboards JOIN dashboard_user AS dashboard_user_1 ON dashboards.id = dashboard_user_1.dashboard_id JOIN ab_user ON ab_user.id = dashboard_user_1.user_id\r\nsuperset_app           | WHERE ab_user.id = %(id_2)s) OR dashboards.id IN (SELECT dashboards.id\r\nsuperset_app           | FROM dashboards LEFT OUTER JOIN (dashboard_slices AS dashboard_slices_1 JOIN slices ON slices.id = dashboard_slices_1.slice_id) ON dashboards.id = dashboard_slices_1.dashboard_id\r\nsuperset_app           | WHERE dashboards.published IS true AND true) OR dashboards.id IN (SELECT favstar.obj_id\r\nsuperset_app           | FROM favstar\r\nsuperset_app           | WHERE favstar.user_id = %(user_id_1)s AND favstar.class_name = %(class_name_1)s))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the `DashboardsNotFoundValidation` checks the existence, this commit adds the `skip_base_filter` option on find_by_ids as `find_by_id` has and use the option for DashboardsNotFoundValidation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/7bd2afd724799be2d5ca3edb90c5b95a56609211/superset/dao/base.py#L56-L63\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n- Before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/215229495-51c51f7b-0e46-4577-8e7d-7686274c86fa.mov\r\n\r\n- After:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/215229482-acf97753-3589-4e92-8eb0-9e347ce7b297.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR removes some global CSS that conflicts with FAB dropdowns.  FAB version was bumped in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22580, and the new version includes markup that certain global CSS styles in `superset.less` now apply to, causing a visual bug with dropdown menus.  The global CSS was introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3241 to style the `VisualizeModal` component.  This component was removed in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5523, so I believe these global styles are no longer used anywhere in the app (though if anyone knows otherwise, definitely let me know).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![localhost_9000_rowlevelsecurityfiltersmodelview_add](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/215122002-121c7349-1a43-4c90-93cb-611beb6c33e6.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![localhost_9000_rowlevelsecurityfiltersmodelview_add (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/215122037-d29e80e4-e0d7-408b-bd4c-5af5fa237ff0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRefactors the use of `BaseApi`:\r\n\r\n- Adds global Superset overrides to `BaseApi`\r\n- Removes unnecessary `include_route_methods`, since what you write is what you get on these classes\r\n- Adds `statsd_metrics` to `BaseApi` endpoints, these endpoint should send metrics also and follow the same convention \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- call an API endpoint for example `api/v1/chart/` and make sure the metric sent is the same has before:\r\n```\r\n2023-01-27 14:10:04,819:DEBUG:superset.stats_logger:[stats_logger] (incr) ChartRestApi.get_list.success\r\n2023-01-27

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds cross filtering functionality to Echarts Graph and World Map.\r\nAdditionally, before user could only click on the edge of Graph chart to open a context menu for Drill By. This PR enables also clicking on nodes.\r\n\r\nKnown issue - In graph chart, the selection after clicking gets cancelled after hovering on any other node or edge. This has yet to be fixed\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/215102016-5e2ed689-fae5-4355-9f3c-a9c2a4069400.mov\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/215102065-9e5dfe3f-4148-491a-94c5-ea66dda942b3.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add Graph and World Map to a dashboard\r\n2. If dashboard has cross filtering enabled, clicking on a country (in World Map) or on a node (in Graph) should enable cross filtering.\r\n3. Clicking again on value that emits a cross filter should remove that filter\r\n4. If dashboard has cross filtering disabled, clicking shouldn't do anything\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

Previously tox was looking at the ``TOX_CONFIG_FILE`` to override the\n  user configuration, however that environment variable is already used to override the main configuration - by\n  :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2890`)\n<h2>v4.4.1 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.1\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In tox 4.4.0 <code>constrain_package_deps</code> was introduced with a default value of <code>True</code>. This has been changed back to\n<code>False</code>, which restores the original behavior of tox 4.3.5 - by :user:<code>masenf</code>. (:issue:<code>2897</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.4.0 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Features - 4.4.0</p>\n<pre><code>- Test environments now recognize boolean config keys ``constrain_package_deps`` (default=true) and ``use_frozen_constraints`` (default=false),\n  which control how tox generates and applies constraints files when performing ``install_package_deps``.\n<p>If <code>constrain_package_deps</code> is true (default), then tox will write out <code>{env_dir}{/}constraints.txt</code> and pass it to\n<code>pip</code> during <code>install_package_deps</code>. If <code>use_frozen_constraints</code> is false (default), the constraints will be taken\nfrom the specifications listed under <code>deps</code> (and inside any requirements or constraints file referenced in <code>deps</code>).\nOtherwise, <code>list_dependencies_command</code> (<code>pip freeze</code>) is used to enumerate exact package specifications which will\nbe written to the constraints file.</p>\n<p>In previous releases, conflicting package dependencies would silently override the <code>deps</code> named in the configuration,\nresulting in test runs against unexpected dependency versions, particularly when using tox factors to explicitly test\nwith different versions of dependencies - by :user:<code>masenf</code>. (:issue:<code>2386</code>)</p>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.0\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When parsing command lines, use <code>shlex(..., posix=True)</code>, even on windows platforms, since non-POSIX mode does not\nhandle escape characters and quoting like a shell would. This improves cross-platform configurations without hacks or\nesoteric quoting.</p>\n<p>To make this transition easier, on Windows, the backslash path separator will not treated as an escape character unless\nit preceeds a quote, whitespace, or another backslash chracter. This allows paths to mostly be written in single or\ndouble backslash style.</p>\n<p>Note that <strong>double-backslash will no longer be escaped to a single backslash in substitutions</strong>, instead the double\nbackslash will be consumed as part of command splitting, on either posix or windows platforms.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nsimilar to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22628, pyathena values for emojis and accents when there are null values are not being parsed correctly. This changes the stringify function to use a built in pandas method, which solves the issues. \r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes some numpy typing errors that are unrelated to this bug, but were failing CI.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"496\" alt=\"Clipboard 2023-25-01 at 7 45 12 PM\"

This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{\npath: &quot;/&quot;,\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,\nchildren: [{\nindex: true,\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently we're checking temporal types based on the `TemporalType` enum. This implicitly assumes that the native temporal datatype on all databases is one of the following:\r\n```\r\n\"DATE\"\r\n\"DATETIME\"\r\n\"SMALLDATETIME\"\r\n\"TEXT\"\r\n\"TIME\"\r\n\"TIME WITH TIME ZONE\"\r\n\"TIMESTAMP\"\r\n\"TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is obviously not an exhaustive list. For instance, Snowflake has a datatype `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` which is not covered (see a recent hotfix for this: #22872). Luckily we already have a method `BaseEngineSpec.get_column_spec` which makes it possible to infer the correct types based on the native type that is backed by a set of overridable regexes. This matching logic correctly identifies `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, along with a host of other similar types. See this code for details: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/8226110be8bea6f1b06ce02def7ea56df44e6b50/superset/db_engine_specs/base.py#L200-L316 \r\n\r\nTo leverage this logic, this PR replaces all references to `TemporalType` in `convert_dttm` with calls to `get_column_spec` to more accurately infer the SQLA type from the native column type string. To ensure this extensive refactor doesn't introduce any regressions, full test coverage is added for all specs that have a `convert_dttm` method. In addition, several legacy unit tests in the integration test suite are migrated to the unit test suite, resulting in 8 deleted legacy test suites and 12 added unit tests. This will marginally speed up CI, but more importantly, it will make it easier to improve and maintain the associated logic going forward, as we now have comprehensive test coverage for this critical piece of code.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCleaning up tech debt from intial SIP-68 work to move towards having newer models (Table, Dataset) to run in explore. Since we are deprioritizing that work, refactoring the ExploreMixin to power `SqlaTable` and `Query` which are legacy models.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nValues for `WEBDRIVER_BASEURL` must end with a slash for the cache warmup to work. Our mdx files sometimes show example values without a trailing slash, which is quite confusing. We can adapt the `fetch_url` task to handle either case (trailing or non-trailing slash) by using our existing util function `get_url_path(...)`.\r\n\r\nRelated to this (`WEBDRIVER_BASEURL`): We stopped using `SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_PROTOCOL`, `SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_ADDRESS`, `SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_PORT` with https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21076. I'm removing the keys from the base config as there does not seem to be any immediate need for them: We already have `WEBDRIVER_BASEURL` (and the `_USER_FRIENDLY` variant), which are in use all over the project.\r\n\r\n### TESTING\r\n\r\nAdded an integration test to ensure the URL is generated correctly.\r\n\r\nFull-text search for the deleted config keys :)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

To make login more reliable and clearer, this PR:\r\n- Removes all `Bearer ${TokenName}` authentication headers.  `TokenName` wasn't being set anywhere, so this header was always sent as `Bearer undefined`.\r\n- Creates reliable login steps in `support/index.ts`.  For each spec file, `cy.login()` will be called once at the beginning and then the resulting session cookie will be preserved for the whole spec file.\r\n- Removes all `cy.login` and `cy.preserveLogin` calls in all spec files and in other Cypress commands.  Now that `login` is called before each spec and the cookie is preserved throughout the whole file, there shouldn't be any need for any additional `login` or `preserveLogin` calls.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR enables the new create dataset flow in dataset view, the `+ -> Data` menu in the app header, chart creation, and database creation. On the create dataset page (`/dataset/add/`), user is brought to their previous page when the cancel button is clicked and the create chart view when the create dataset button is clicked.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes all the issues introduced in the original iteration of this PR: #22610 \r\n\r\n- Issues fixed: \r\n  - Slow loading navigating to and from SQL Lab\r\n  - Disappearing top nav in SQL Lab\r\n  - Create Dataset menu disabled in top nav's `+` menu\r\n  - Error message occurs when you go to the \"create dataset\" page after you've deleted a newly connected dataset\r\n  - Already existing datasets are not marked as \"already exists\" in dataset creation page\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Check all areas in Superset where user can create a dataset, it should bring you to the new create dataset page: `/dataset/add`\r\n  - All creation spots: `+ Dataset` button in dataset view, the `+ -> Data` menu in the app header, chart creation, and database creation.\r\n  - There should no longer be an Add Dataset modal in any area of the app\r\n- On the new create dataset page, ensure that:\r\n  - Cancel button brings you to the previous page you were on\r\n  - Create Dataset button brings you to the create chart view with the newly created dataset selected\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ]

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR resolves some typing and props issues in the Table component:\r\n- Removes some unused type/interface definitions and type annotations\r\n- Imports some types directly from AntD rather than redefining them\r\n- Removes uses of `any`\r\n- Makes the `Table` component type and its corresponding `TableProps` interface generic, requiring the `RecordType` type variable.  This makes `Table` more compatible with the AntD components/types it extends.\r\n- Stops `TableProps` from inheriting from its AntD counterpart.  Our `Table` component only knows how to handle a subset of the properties in the AntD `TableProps`, but it currently accepts every prop defined in AntD `TableProps`.\r\n- Fixes support for the `onRow` prop, which is described in Storybook but isn't currently working.\r\n- Updates imports so we're only importing things that are exposed in `antd/lib/table`, `antd/lib/config-provider`, and `antd/lib/pagination`\r\n- Fixes the jsdoc for the `selectionType` prop\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- There should be no user-facing changes\r\n- Check that Storybook \"Actions\" tab now registers actions\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature
