This is now fixed.\r\n- Mixed charts were not working because `frozenset` can't serialize nested dictionaries. I added a custom function that serializes to JSON in order, so we can compare sets of metrics.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nCreate an embedded dashboard with a mixed chart and a native filter. Or import this file:\r\n\r\n[dashboard_export_20240319T101212.zip](https://github.com/apache/superset/files/14651748/dashboard_export_20240319T101212.zip)\r\n\r\nEnable embedding in the dashboard. Set up a simple app with RLS:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    payload = {\r\n        \"user\": {\r\n            \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n            \"first_name\": \"admin\",\r\n            \"last_name\":

SUMMARY\r\nThe current explore drag-and-drop (DND) indicator only highlights the drop allow zone, and users can recognize the disallowed zone when they try to drop an item there. However, this UX can be challenging when the current dragging item is not droppable in the entire zone, as there is no highlighting to indicate this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/68d359bf-e8b7-44ff-bafb-e1b2055a0d48\r\n\r\nThis lack of feedback can lead users to believe that the DND functionality is not working, until they mouse over the zone.\r\n\r\nThis commit aims to address this UX issue by implementing changes. Now, all droppable zones will be highlighted when dragging, and a different color scheme will indicate which zones are available and which are unavailable for dropping. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/0f795241-9eeb-4a53-92c2-00a6a8d3d282\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the commit also updates the drag over feedback to align with the changes made to the dashboard's DND UX(#26699). This way, users can have a consistent and improved drag-and-drop experience, with clear usability feedback.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAfter selecting an custom_width value for a PNG screenshot, the value was stored, even though it was not needed.

file creation was constructed outside of the map generator jupyter notebook. Up on completion of #27455 pr it is [suggested](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27455#issuecomment-1998398195) to add italy regions process to the map generator notebook file. Regions are created from dataframe itself since it provides region - region code information. In 2019 [major changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:IT) applied on italy region information thus natural earh data directly used to create regions. This is more dynamic than creating custom dictionary as the natural-earth data updated maps will follow (this is only valid for countries that has ISO codes for all granulartiy, countries such as Turkey uses NUTS codes thus it requires custom dictionary). \r\n\r\nAlong with italy regions some code improvements also added. When plotting all the maps in earlier stages of notebook, process fails due to missing country-regions. This was fixed and those countries are shown in the center of the mini-plot for corresponding country.  New italy gejson file committed , \".ts\" file remained same. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### The old italy regions geojson file plot\r\n\r\n![original_italy_region](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15057168/4a4322c7-d3ad-40ac-ac5c-faac2d610751)\r\n\r\n#### New italy regions geojson file plot\r\n\r\n![new italy region](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15057168/f78cf545-3742-4cae-bbc0-b54282faed9f)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nAirbnb had previously overridden an option to disable ad-hoc metrics with commit #17202.\r\nHowever, with the D&D option now enabled, users can accidentally drop an ad-hoc metric, thus gaining access to the previously disabled (tab) option.\r\nTo address this, the commit includes a condition to check whether the item being dropped is among the saved metrics, preventing such cases.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds an option to disable the drill to detail feature per database. This is useful for databases that don't support atomic-level queries or contain large amounts of data not suitable for this type of operation.\r\n\r\nDuring the planning phase of 4.0, the proposal to deprecate the `DRILL_TO_DETAIL` feature flag was rejected for the same reasons this PR is introducing this configuration. The hope is that with this new feature, we can deprecate the feature flag in the next major release. @mattitoo \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of [SIP-117](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26786):\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce `SQLScript` and `SQLStatement`, and replace any simple calls to `sqlparse` with calls to the new classes (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26767).\r\n- [X] Implement a custom `SQLStatement` class for `Kusto`, since [it doesn't use conventional SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) (this PR).\r\n- [ ] Implement `insert_rls_in_predicate` and `insert_rls_as_subquery` inside `SQLStatement`.\r\n- [ ] Implement `get_cte_query` inside `SQLStatement`.\r\n- [ ] Implement `apply_top_to_sql` in `SQLStatement`.\r\n- [ ] Replace `ParsedQuery` with `SQLScript` and `SQLStatement`.\r\n- [ ] Remove `sqlparse` from Superset.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of SIP-117 is to encapsulate all SQL parsing and manipulation logic inside two classes: `SQLScript` and `SQLStatement` (mostly the latter; `SQLScript` is just a lightweight collection of `SQLStatement` objects). This includes logic that currently lives inside the DB engine specs (eg, `parse_sql`, `apply_top_to_sql`, `get_cte_query`, etc.).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one of the DB engine specs currently supported by Superset is very unusual. The `KustoKqlEngineSpec` engine spec uses a language called KQL that is very different from SQL. In order to move the `parse_sql` method out of the DB engine spec this PR refactors the `SQLStatement` class, introducing a `BaseSQLStatement` base class that is used by `SQLStatement` (for dialects supported by `sqlglot`) and `KustoKQLStatement` (for KQL).\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a path forward for supporting non-SQL databases! I only added support for `KustoKqlEngineSpec` because it's already there, but IMHO we should deprecate it in the future. Supporting non-SQL databases adds a lot of complexity to Superset, and is a problem that is better solved orthogonally by writing a SQL adapter.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe are adding the implementation and usage of the AWS S3 upload feature in Apache Superset. This feature allows users to send reports directly to an AWS S3 bucket. There are three methods available for authentication: taking credentials from the user in the frontend, taking credentials from the superset_config.py file, or utilizing an AWS IAM role associated with the ECS task role.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n#### Installation and Setup\r\n\r\n- Ensure Apache Superset is installed and running.\r\n\r\n- Ensure S3 bucket policy is configured for interacting with AWS S3.\r\n\r\n- Configure Apache Superset to enable the AWS S3 upload feature.\r\n\r\n- Follow the method-specific setup instructions outlined below.\r\n\r\n#### Common Configuration for Enabling AWS S3 feature for all below method.\r\n\r\n- User should update the superset_config.py (docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config.py) file with following:\r\n\r\n- Uncomment the following code in superset_config.py.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# AWS S3 reporting - uncomment to use\r\n# FEATURE_FLAGS = {\"ALERT_REPORTS\": True, \"ENABLE_AWS\": True}\r\n#ALERT_REPORTS_NOTIFICATION_DRY_RUN = False\r\n# AWS Credentials\r\n#AWS_ACCESS_KEY = '####'\r\n#AWS_SECRET_KEY = '####'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Method 1: Frontend User Credentials\r\n\r\n1. When accessing the feature in the frontend, users will be prompted to enter their AWS credentials.\r\n\r\n2. Users should provide their AWS Access Key and the AWS Secret Access Key in the user interface itself.\r\n\r\n3. Ensure proper IAM policies are applied to the user's credentials to grant necessary permissions for uploading to the specified S3 bucket.\r\n\r\n#### Method 2: config.py Credentials\r\n\r\n1. Update the config.py file in your Apache Superset installation directory.\r\n\r\n2. Add the AWS credentials as configuration variables in superset_config.py.\r\n\r\n3. Ensure proper IAM policies are applied to the user's credentials to grant necessary permissions for uploading to the specified S3 bucket.\r\n\r\n#### Method 3: AWS IAM Role\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the ECS task running Apache Superset is associated with an IAM role.\r\n\r\n2. Configure the IAM role's permissions to allow uploading to the desired S3 bucket.\r\n\r\n3. Apache Superset will automatically use the IAM role associated with the ECS task for authentication when uploading to S3.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\nOnce setup has been done, the AWS S3 can be used for sending reports/alert directly to the S3 bucket using following0 AWS S3 method options:\r\n\r\n- AWS_S3_credentials\r\n\r\n- AWS_S3_pyconfig\r\n\r\n- AWS_S3_IAM\r\n\r\n¬∑ Navigate to settings, then on Alerts & Reports.\r\n\r\n¬∑ Create alert /report like we use to do with the Email or Slack.\r\n\r\n¬∑ In the Notification Method select S3.\r\n\r\n¬∑ Then select the available S3 method options: AWS_S3_credentials, AWS_S3_pyconfig, AWS_S3_IAM.\r\n\r\n¬∑ Fill the required aws credentials in case of AWS_S3_credentials else just give the bucket name to use.\r\n\r\nLike Email, we can also create the reports directly to the Aws S3 bucket from the dashboard and charts page. All three S3 method options would be available from the dashboard and charts page.\r\n\r\n¬∑ Navigate to any of the dashboard or Chart.\r\n\r\n¬∑ Create the report using Set up a S3 report and use any of the S3 method options available.\r\n\r\n¬∑ Generated report can be seen in the Alerts & Reports page.\r\n\r\nNote: If the User doesn‚Äôt enable the feature flag of ENABLE_AWS, but has ALERT_REPORTS set to True then Aws s3 option wouldn‚Äôt be available but he can still use the default Notification method from the Apache Superset i.e. of Email.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n<!--- Check

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSome people think Superset is slow. üôÉ They wait on a chart to render, not realizing that Superset is mostly idle waiting on the analytical database to run the query and return the results.\r\n\r\nYouTube has a nice feature called \"Stats for nerds\" when you right click on a [video](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-13 at 16-49-15 Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Music Video) - YouTube](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/7e49e4b5-fb91-4dfe-a7d0-723daca9ccaa)\r\n\r\nWe thought of adding a similar option for charts, so that users can see how much time is spent in different steps:\r\n\r\n- generating a query\r\n- running the query\r\n- fetching results\r\n- post-processing the results\r\n- converting the results to JSON\r\n- rendering chart\r\n\r\nCollecting this data is not easy because the Superset callstack is pretty deep. In order to do this I introduced a new Flask global called `telemetry` that can be used as a context manager:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask import g\r\n\r\nwith g.telemetry.add(\"Running query\"):\r\n    result = run_query(sql)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen instrumenting an exposed endpoint with the `show_telemetry` decorator the resulting JSON payload will include the telemetry data, in a format suitable to be rendered as a [flame graph](https://brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) or Gantt chart (formatted for readability):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl 'http://localhost:8089/api/v1/chart/data?form_data=%7B%22slice_id%22%3A98%7D&dashboard_id=12' -X POST ... | jq\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"telemetry\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"Running command\",\r\n      \"start\": 1710362199.5533068,\r\n      \"children\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"Executing query\",\r\n          \"start\": 1710362200.416116,\r\n          \"children\": [],\r\n          \"end\": 1710362210.498135\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"Fetching data from cursor\",\r\n          \"start\": 1710362210.4981928,\r\n          \"children\": [],\r\n          \"end\": 1710362210.498541\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"Loading data into dataframe\",\r\n          \"start\": 1710362210.504464,\r\n          \"children\": [],\r\n          \"end\": 1710362210.5063\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"end\": 1710362210.512182\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"JSON encoding\",\r\n      \"start\": 1710362210.512204,\r\n      \"children\": [],\r\n      \"end\": 1710362210.512265\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a next PR I'll add a way to visualize the data in the interface.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe SQL Lab bootstrap data, which includes all queries associated with every open editor tab, is quite large in size.\r\nThis has been causing a noticeable delay in the initial loading time for SQL Lab. It's important to note that these queries are solely used for maintaining a query history, so this update is designed to bypass these queries in the bootstrap data.\r\nInstead, we will use the Query API to fetch the same results when the Query History component loads, making the process more efficient.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"537\"

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently zero imputation, forward values and backwards values in advanced analytics only works correctly if the time index is completely missing - if the index is present, and there are null values for a specific series, they will not be imputed correctly.\r\n\r\nWhen doing zero imputation for a single series and the time index for the intermediate values is missing, the imputation works as expected:\r\n<img width=\"1338\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/2f3a2888-5289-45b9-b101-95e0284352f7\">\r\n\r\nHowever, with multiple series, it no longer works if the intermediate values are missing in one series for certain indices, but are present for the other. Notice the missing imputation for \"boy\" series:\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nZero imputation:\r\n<img width=\"1335\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/33d40e99-011f-405f-bf18-ae0b37c565cc\">\r\n\r\nForward values:\r\n<img width=\"1333\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/40a45807-38b8-4609-801e-b5a2665e2af3\">\r\n\r\nBackward values:\r\n<img width=\"1330\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/3bbbdb38-22e0-4a12-b257-fb742f6ae2ab\">\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the zero, backfill and forward fill are imputed correctly.\r\n\r\nZero imputation:\r\n<img width=\"1336\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/e3008e1a-7732-41f3-8513-3c52d195e434\">\r\n\r\nForward values:\r\n<img width=\"1336\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/7e26b0e6-c614-4c66-bf5f-607c5beadfb2\">\r\n\r\nBackward values:\r\n<img width=\"1341\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/d6ead2d4-46d4-44fe-9830-d9c68903f6bd\">\r\n\r\nNote, other methods, like linear interpolation were already working as expected.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a temporal chart with multiple series, where at least one temporal index is missing for one series\r\n2. Perform zero imputation, forward values or backward values filling\r\n3. Notice it doesn't work.\r\n4. Make the series with the missing indices the only series in the chart, and notice all above mentioned imputation methods work as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn the DeckGL map plugin we can only select a Mapbox style from the [predefined list](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2499a1cf5a7f298c1ee2f34b3d67ca1d18bb7457/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-deckgl/src/utilities/Shared_DeckGL.jsx#L373-L380) or [typing a new Mapbox style URL](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26031).\r\n\r\nThis change add support for tile server layer making use of Deck.gl [TileLayer](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/geo-layers/tile-layer). The well known [OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) layer provided by https://[abc].tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png is added to the list making easier for users not having a Mapbox account to have a background layer on map charts.\r\n\r\nIt has been tested with other tile server URL \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nChoose Mapbox, Openstreetmap or use a custom mapbox or tile URL\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1701393/5bc30c3e-5385-4cc6-9607-0abba8901fe4)\r\n\r\nOSM background

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nSelect the OpenStreetMap background layer or paste a tile server URL eg. `tile://https://tile.osm.ch/name-it/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`, `tile://https://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

an alternative formulation to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27464 by performing a two-phase approach for extracting tables from SQL which may contain Jinja templating, resulting in non-parsable SQL from SQLGlot's perspective. \r\n\r\nThe logic is outlined in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27464#issuecomment-1989433700.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPOC around simplifying our python dependency setup. Goal ultimately is to:\r\n* restore dependabot support \r\n* untangle complex nested dependencies / simplify\r\n* get out of the current impasse with pip-compile-multi - where we may have to bissect 30+ upgrades to figure out which one breaks the build\r\n\r\nFind more context here -> https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/27413\r\n\r\n\r\n### Simplify from 6 to 2 bundles -> `base.txt` and `development.txt`\r\nCurrently we have 6 bundles -> **base/development/testing/integration/docker/local**\r\nHere I'm aiming at bringing it down to 2 -> \r\n- a base/lean bundle\r\n- a development bundle (with everything)\r\n\r\nWhile the benefits of simplifying are clear, the tradeoff is having a more bloated setup for development. My stance here that having a more bloated dev setup is better than having 3-4 that are confusing and half-broken at times. Also note that while it's super important for the production dependencies to be pinned, it matters a bit less going into the longer tail of dependencies. \r\n\r\nI'm certain the current setup with 6 requirements files is overly engineered/complex and should be simplified. Is 2 the sweet spot? Do we need 3 to strike the right balance? Let's POC with 2 and see how it impacts CI / dev enviornments \r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a POC, if successful, next step could be to move away from\r\npip-compile-multi and onto a simpler pip-compile setup, and restore\r\ndependatot support.\r\n\r\n### What's in this PR\r\n\r\nI got pulled deeper than I expected in this PR, resulting in related\r\nside-quests that I took on and want to list out here so you understand\r\nwhat's in the 40 files touched by this PR:\r\n- Moved towards `pyproject.toml` the now-standard way to manage deps and project semantics.\r\n  This is compatible with dependabot and the ecosystem in general\r\n- created `requirements/pip-compile-superset.py` a simple utility/CLI that wraps pip-compile\r\n  commands and features around python dependency management, sure you can use pip-compile\r\n  directly, but this utility is a bit more opinionated (which files to generate with what input)\r\n- documented and spread the use of `pip-compile-superset.py`\r\n- Moved all `requirements/*.in` files into `pyproject.toml`\r\n- introducing a `setup-backend` github action to DRY the python-setup logic in one place.\r\n  now that is used consistently across a dozen+ actions, we have more consistency and can\r\n  ultimately tweak for more perf\r\n- moved all actions to use this reusable action\r\n\r\n### Mechanics\r\n- Moving to using the now standard `pyproject.toml` - as specified in PEP-517 & PEP-518\r\n- Using simple, basic `pip-compile` to\r\n  - build the simple `requirements/base.txt`\r\n  - build a more complex `requirements/development.txt`, by specifying many `--extra` that point to group of \"extra_requires\". This file is a superset of the base file, and contrarily to before, re-itemizes each dependency (pip-compile-multi was able to point one to another - so it'd be DRYer) \r\n\r\n### Composition in specific envs\r\nHow to use the existing constructs to build upon them in your own environment, like we do at Preset and Airbnb? What's the pattern to follow given these new mechanics. Listing out the needs/requirements around this:\r\n- allow \"extending\" the requirements with extra/external/arbitrary new libraries while specifying ranges \r\n- allow \"overriding\" rules for any library specified or inherited in the tree \r\n- reuse as much of the pinned list from the tested list, meaning we want to be as close to possible as `base.txt` except where specfied\r\n\r\nStep by step:\r\n- create a new `preset-prod-requirements.in` that references the `extra` you want, first line should be something like `-e .[hive,presto,mysql]`\r\n- add your rules on top, things like `cryptography>=3.0.0,<4.0.0` or `some-lib-only-me-needs`\r\n- copy the rich/tested `development.txt` output file as your target. `cp requirements/development.txt requirements/preset-prod-requirements.txt` so it becomes the basis for your environment.\r\n- compile with constraints `pip-compile -o preset-prod-requirements.txt preset-prod-requirements.in -c requirements/base.txt`. Note that the output here acts as an input as well, and that we're counting on the fact that our input file + the latest output file leads to a new deterministic output that fits the criteria above \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nLet CI play its course.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen creating a virtual dataset we pass the unprocessed SQL to security manager. If the SQL contains Jinja it might not be valid and might fail to parse, which causes the security manager to allow the query to run (see https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26748).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by processing the templated SQL before passing it to the security manager.

departmens, there is also need for Turkey's Regional map for geospatial statistical inference with organizational data. The regional polygons are created from city level polygon using geopandas. \r\n* Original city-wise polygons are acquired from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tur?\r\n* ISO 3166-2 code is presented for city level such as TR-34 (Istanbul). However, after some search, there seems to be less or no information about Turkey's ISO 3166-2 codes for regional information. Region information is obtained from Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) which has been widely used for Turkey since 2002. Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) provides board level information using NUTS codes which is of great benefit to oraganizations and companies. In view of the lack of ISO 3166-2 code information for Turkey at the region level and the wide use of NUTS codes, we associated 12 region polygons with NUTS representations for ISO and NAME_1 keys of geojson. For future if or when we can find ISO 3166-2 on region level, we can create new PR to change the data structure. Considering majority of the spatial data coming from TUIK, polygon will be easy to join with the TUIK data.\r\n\r\nRef= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:TR\r\nRef=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUTS_statistical_regions_of_Turkey\r\n\r\n* The data structure is as follows\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-03-09 18-22-37](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15057168/8373810d-6d1f-4257-9e23-f6b357c7f2d5)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Original regions geojson was 13MB of size which could crash superset on production. To mitigate that problem, we used simplify(tolerance=0.005, preserve_topology=True). After simplification the accuracy of the polygons are checked againts the original file with the area functions and the difference was -0.01, which is acceptible considering the size reduction from 13mb to 448kb. \r\n* The geojson file follows the same structure with Italy's regions such as \"urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84\". \r\n* Gejson file both tested with locally on python environment and with Apache Superset 3.1 version. Images are presented as follows.\r\n* Upon acceptance of the Region based feature addition. Sub regional data (26 region) and district level (973) polygons will be PR'ed with NUTS codes from TUIK institution. With these features complete granularity will be added to Apache superset for Turkey's locations. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n## Turkey's cities geojson file which is used to create regional based polygons.\r\n![turkey cities](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15057168/7f43194d-4bfc-45b1-b0ea-cc24c9d8a0d7)\r\n\r\n## Turkey's regional polygon file after merging cities into regions.\r\n### Base plot from matplotlib\r\n![turkey_regions](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15057168/523f346d-7836-4cc8-92c2-066bbf574b75)\r\n### Colored plot from matplotlib\r\n![turkey_regions_colored](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15057168/a59ec300-478a-4eba-af62-76dfcbc5664a)\r\n### Apache superset dev-environment test image on local test\r\n* test is conducted by creating a new table and iserting toy data that matches the ISO (NUTS) codes. \r\n![Screenshot from 2024-03-10 12-30-25](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15057168/12c7601d-ec90-48d8-ba6f-6f34f9b732b9)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

upgraded to `16.9.53`, and as a result, package-lock selected the `16.14.51` version.\r\n\r\n![feat_telemetry___Adding_Scarf_based_telemetry_to_Superset___26011__¬∑_apache_superset_8437a23](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/95622d6a-87c8-4c4b-9486-30506ccee9d9)\r\n\r\nHere at Airbnb, our internal dependencies are not yet compatible with `types/react@16.14.51`, thereby posing a hurdle for our release. We intend to explore compatibility with 16.14.51 in Superset 5.0 or later versions, although the timing is not ideal right now.\r\n\r\nThis commit modifies the `package-lock` to reflect the same version number as outlined in #26011.\r\nSimultaneously, we've also lowered @ant-design/icons@5.2.6 (#26727) to 5.0.1, due to its incompatibility with 16.9.53.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nnpm

SUMMARY\r\nfixes #24072 in which Microsoft SQL Server requires an order-by column in order for pagination to succeed.  In doing so, now the drilled data is always sorted by the 1st column in ascending order.  Previously it retained the dataset's sort order.\r\n\r\nBetter fixes outside of my ability might be:\r\n- Implement this on a per-database level\r\n- Sort by row number or the equivalent to functionally do nothing and preserve the underlying data order\r\n- Improve user controls for how drilled data displays, allowing the user to control which columns are shown and what the sort order is\r\n\r\nBut I think the harm introduced (re-sorting the drilled data) is outweighed by fixing this feature for MSSQL.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- CI\r\n- Sam deployed and manually tested the docker image\r\n\r\n**BEFORE

SUMMARY\r\nAfter the changes in this PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23762 color inconsistency on refreshes was reintroduced.\r\n\r\nFixes #16970\r\nFixes #26456\r\nFixes #28104\r\nFixes #25384 (specifically for metrics changing colors on refreshes. An additional fix is required for charts emitting only COUNT(*) as label and not specific ones)\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Fixes color inconsistency on refreshes\r\n- Fixes color inconsistency from chart in hidden tab to Explore\r\n- It helps avoiding color collisions by adding a usage tracker of the colors at the chart level\r\n- Deprecates AVOID_COLORS_COLLISION feature flag\r\n- Renames the shared labels color map to `LabelColorsMap` \r\n- Centralizes the logics of generating the colors map and color metadata\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Set a color scheme for a dashboard\r\n2. Refresh the dashboard\r\n3. Colors should not change\r\n4. Going from any chart in any tab to Explore, should carry the same colors forward\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR improve docker-compose support for development, testing and staging, but is taking a stance **against using docker-compose for production use cases**. The reality is that the challenges around building a functional dev setup and a stable production environment are intricately similar **yet intricately diverging**. More segmentation here will lead to more sanity on both sides and more safety. docker-compose is now 100% focussed on supporting development workflows: fast startup, fully loaded builds with testing/dev tools where needed, ROOT access in-Docker so that you can bash into docker to debug, debug flags on, ...\r\n\r\nFor production support, see our helm chart and installation docs.  \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNow. Currently our docker-compose setup pulls images that have been built\r\nrecently on the `master` branch (`apache/superset:${TAG:-latest`). While this works in most cases, it's\r\nnon-deterministic on not guaranteed to always work. For example if I\r\nmerge a PR to master that removes a certain python library for instance,\r\npeople in branches out there doing development that still have that\r\ndependencies are not going to work.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I change the docker-compose setup(s) to:\r\n- reference the local Dockerfile\r\n- point to the right cache location (apache/superset-cache:....)\r\n- make that DRY since it's repeated many times across the docker-compose\r\n  files\r\n- touch up both docker-compose.yml and docker-compose-non-dev.yml with\r\n  the same approach\r\n- don't download Chromium by default as we're booting up `superset-node`, that added significant\r\n  load time at every `docker-compose up` when in most cases we don't need that headless browser.\r\n  I think that's to support pupeteer, and can still be set with the env var `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD` that seemed declared, but orphaned as nothing reference it.\r\n- merging `docker/.env` and `docker/.env-non-dev` as it's all meant for development now\r\n\r\nThis should work across platforms, though I could only validate on `linux/arm64`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAs far as testing goes, I made sure this builds and that the resulting\r\nsetup is functional. I was also very fast in my experience, the cache\r\nwas clearly leveraged here.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-08T02:00:10Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:51:04Z","closed_at":"2024-03-11T20:15:03Z","merged_at":"2024-03-11T20:15:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1adede1ee670ad800c07aeb76f2f73799228960","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sfirke","id":7569808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Njk4MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7569808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke","html_url":"https://github.com/sfirke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfirke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":3815127807,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7jZjr_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/doc","name":"doc","color":"6f9eaf","default":false,"description":"Namespace

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWe keep seeing this error in Cypress:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe detected that the Chromium Renderer process just crashed.\r\n  \r\n  This is the equivalent to seeing the 'sad face' when Chrome dies.\r\n  \r\n  This can happen for a number of different reasons:\r\n  \r\n  - You wrote an endless loop and you must fix your own code\r\n  - You are running Docker (there is an easy fix for this: see link below)\r\n  - You are running lots of tests on a memory intense application\r\n  - You are running in a memory starved VM environment\r\n  - There are problems with your GPU / GPU drivers\r\n  - There are browser bugs in Chromium\r\n  \r\n  You can learn more including how to fix Docker here:\r\n  \r\n  https://on.cypress.io/renderer-process-crashed\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I go to [that URL](https://on.cypress.io/renderer-process-crashed), it doesn't actually say anything about how to fix Docker, but it does suggest turning on the `experimentalMemoryManagement` flag for Chromium based browsers. So... well... here goes nothing!\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nWell, CI should pass without that error, that's for sure!\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

file with chart name.\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen we download any chart as excel/csv file, the file doesn't have appropriate name. So for filename its like\r\n*  if the report is paginated it downloads zip folder, whose name is just timestamp for that we can make it like reportName_timstamp.zip.\r\n     * Inside that zip comes 2 files, one which contains the data that can be named as reportname_timestamp.csv and other one reportname_rowcount_timestamp.csv\r\n* In case report is not paginated we can directly name the file as reportname_timestamp.csv.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/48522685/c109e299-83c6-4df1-ab74-9fbc33089a1a)\r\nAfter\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/48522685/db7d5768-c300-4f8b-bd26-866ac7382e91)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/48522685/22da02ca-d814-40ae-bb3b-20fecd48f2da)\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a shared label color is used in the mixed series chart, there seems to be an issue where the label color, particularly in the 2nd series label, is not accurately rendered. This occurs because the mixed series passes the label color name with a ` (1)` suffix, which is not necessary according to the color algorithm.\r\nThis commit aims to address this issue by removing this redundant suffix from the color scale key. \r\n\r\n|![Screenshot 2024-03-05 at 4 28 04‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/4d3bac15-f933-4ae0-b01d-f080f886e155)|![Screenshot

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26766 restricted some CI workflows to run specifically on the `master` branch. This resulted in a problem for the release branches where running CI is really important when cherry-picking fixes into the branch. This PR adds a regex to allow CI to run on push events for release branches, restoring the previous behavior.\r\n\r\nCheck [filter-pattern-cheat-sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet) for details about the regex. Dots don't need to be escaped.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nRestricted CI workflows should run only on `master` and branches that match the regex.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nIn Advanced Analytics, if the Min Periods value is 5, the first row in the resulting `df_rolling` with a valid result will be row 4 (since counting starts at 0).  Right now the line `df_rolling = df_rolling[min_periods:]` truncates rows 0-4 -- that is, five rows -- throwing out the first rolling value that satisfies the min_periods requirement.\r\n\r\nCurrently the tooltip for Min Periods is misleading, this will make it true.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\nHere in Superset 3.1.1 you can see that the 5th bar should be eligible for a rolling average since Min Periods is 5.  But it's only beginning on the 6th bar that the line appears.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/7569808/aefae835-fb29-4c8c-985d-74c798798ed9)\r\n\r\nWhen I tell Superset to use 5-Period averages for the rolling window and min of 4 periods, this truncates the first 4 rows (due to the buggy off-by-one I'm fixing) and serves what I wanted.  27.4 is indeed the average of the first 5 periods and a valid result.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/7569808/e98dd0c5-dc25-48fe-91b7-c9da1a600e40)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nBuild a chart with rolling average in an ephemeral

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR intend to build query object for the time comparison in frontend rather than backend. The `datediff` implemented in [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27368), so `InheritedRange` is also supported in frontend.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify making query object, created `getTimeComparisonFiltersByQueryObject` and `getShiftedTimeRange` utils and removed previous frontend and backend relative codes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the Big Number with Time Comparison is rendered only horizontally and is not responsive in small containers. This PR refactors a lot of styles of the chart (table display -> flex) and implements a ResizeObserver which controls the flex direction - row for wide containers and column for narrow containers.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/71f08067-56e0-4b98-95e7-419286de6a5a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Big Number with Time Comparison chart\r\n2. Save and add to a dashboard\r\n3. Play with chart container's width and height - in large container the numbers should be displayed horizontally, and in small - vertically\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nThe PR introduced a new function in date time expression that is `datediff(<from>, <to>, [time unit],)`, it returns a integer, so the return value should apply in the `dateadd` function.\r\n\r\nThe basic form is:\r\n```\r\n# return value is 9\r\ndatediff(datetime('2018-01-01T00:00:00'), datetime('2018-01-10T00:00:00'))\r\n\r\n# return value is -9\r\ndatediff(datetime('2018-01-10T00:00:00'), datetime('2018-01-01T00:00:00'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `from` and `to` parameter is able to be set any date time expression:\r\n```\r\n# return value is -365\r\ndatediff(dateadd(datetime('2018-01-01T00:00:00'), 1, year), datetime('2018-01-10T00:00:00'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `datediff` also be in `dateadd` as a time delta\r\n```\r\n# return value is \"datetime(2017, 12, 23, 0, 0, 0)\"\r\ndateadd(\r\n    datetime('2018-01-01T00:00:00'),\r\n    datediff(datetime('2018-01-10T00:00:00'), datetime('2018-01-01T00:00:00')),\r\n    day,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe current behavior for updating assets via the API is inconsistent:\r\n* When updating dashboards and reports, the `owners` information wouldn't be modified unless it's part of the update payload\r\n* When updating datasets and charts, the `owners` information would be lost unless if included in the update payload\r\n\r\nThis scenario introduces issues as for example an admin updating the dataset description via the API would remove all owners.\r\n\r\nThis PR centralizes this logic to ensure consistency across charts, dashboards, datasets and reports (also DRYer).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTests added. To test through the UI:\r\n1. Create a new chart. \r\n2. Update its description via the API.\r\n3. Validate the `owners` configuration was not affected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-01T17:36:48Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:51:24Z","closed_at":"2024-03-06T16:40:41Z","merged_at":"2024-03-06T16:40:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"66bf70172f2cbd24b17b503588f2edbed0a63247","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5767284349,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABV8HGfQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v4.0","name":"v4.0","color":"83D477","default":false,"description":"Label

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27117 removed the following deprecated endpoint:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@deprecated(new_target=\"/sqllab\")\r\ndef sqllab(self) -> FlaskResponse:\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich was registered in Superset's initialization:\r\n\r\n```\r\nappbuilder.add_view_no_menu(SqlLab)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`superset init` uses the registered views to dynamically generate the permissions, in that case, `can_sqllab` was generated from that entry and it does not exist anymore in a fresh installation of Superset. Searching for [can_sqllab](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fsuperset%20can_sqllab&type=code) we can still find many references to it in the codebase, including the menu item that is missing. This PR adds that permission back using custom permissions.\r\n\r\nI also did a diff between 3.1 and 4.0 and found that the following permissions were removed:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncan_import_dashboards\r\ncan_my_queries\r\ncan_profile\r\ncan_sqllab\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only permission that is still referenced in the codebase is `can_sqllab`.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/27310\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCheck that the `SQL query` option appears in the global + menu.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nWe are introducing the same instant time comparison controls from `BigNumber with Time Comparison` plugin is using into the `Table Chart`. This will allow users to quickly compare numeric data in tables to fixed time ranges or a custom time range.\r\n\r\nSame as the previous work with `BigNumber with Time Comparison` chart, these changes are behind the experimental Feature Flag and will have no effect on current charts if the FF is OFF or if the control is not activated in the panel.\r\n\r\nDifferent from the `BigNumber with Time Comparison` , we wont have multiple queries built in the frontend sent to the API, instead, we're expanding the original queries to send a new field that would indicate whether or not the query should produce a JOINed query with between the ranges.\r\n\r\nAny new viz type we want to use these new controls, we must use single query approach, just `BigNumber with Time Comparison` should be using the multiple queries approach until a follow up PR updates it.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit of using single query and not multiple is that we can create the aforementioned JOIN statements to prepare correct results of queries, with the JOINS we can address comparison queries with Server Pagination for example which is not possible with running queries in isolation.\r\n\r\nThis PR must be followed by other non-blocking adjustments that are still in the work:\r\n1. Make use of a control that will display the time ranges use in both queries\r\n2. Make use of the `DATEDIFF` function to build the comparison time range\r\n3. Enhancements to UI with expand/collapse features and others\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNew metrics:\r\n<img width=\"1699\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 14 11 51\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/38889534/22c747a1-6f84-488f-89c2-59948565105d\">\r\n\r\nNew Metrics with Server Pagination:\r\n<img width=\"1699\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 14 13 01\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/38889534/9c1c8c83-c85e-4a0f-8a80-67cdb55373a9\">\r\n\r\nRegular Table if FF is OFF or the control is not being used:\r\n<img width=\"1699\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 14 14 25\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/38889534/bbf6a26b-9728-40db-9cb7-7cefe186c1df\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nDue to changing `metrics` control to `metric` in Big Number with Time Comparison chart, the existing charts were broken due to missing `metric` in form data. This PR adds a migration which takes the first item from `metrics` and applies it to the new `metric` control.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Revert commit fd4f9ac (`feat: Use standardized controls in Big Number with Time Comparison`)\r\n2. Create a Big Number with Time Comparison chart and save it\r\n3. Un-revert the commit\r\n4. Verify that now the chart is broken - no metric is added\r\n5. Run the migration\r\n6. Verify that the chart now works and `metric` control has a value\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

[reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) from 4.1.7 to 5.1.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases\">reselect's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.1.0</h2>\n<p>This <strong>minor release</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds a new <code>createSelector.withTypes&lt;RootState&gt;()</code> and <code>createStructuredSelector.withTypes&lt;RootState&gt;()</code> API</li>\n<li>Deprecates the <code>TypedStructuredSelectorCreator</code> type introduced in 5.0</li>\n<li>Aims to reduce false positives in <code>identityFunctionCheck</code> by only running if the output selector is passed one argument</li>\n<li>Fixes a bug with <code>weakMapMemoize</code>'s <code>resultEqualityCheck</code> when used with a primitive result.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><code>withTypes</code></h2>\n<p>Most commonly, selectors will accept the root state of a Redux store as their first argument. <code>withTypes</code> allows you to specify what that first argument will be ahead of creating the selector, meaning it doesn't have to be specified.</p>\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>// previously\nexport const selectPostById = createSelector(\n  [\n    (state: RootState) =&gt; state.posts.entities,\n    (state: RootState, id: number) =&gt; id,\n  ],\n  (entities, id) =&gt; entities[id],\n);\n// now\nexport const createAppSelector = createSelector.withTypes&lt;RootState&gt;();\n<p>export const selectPostById = createAppSelector(\n[(state) =&gt; state.posts.entities, (state, id: number) =&gt; id],\n(entities, id) =&gt; entities[id],\n);\n</code></pre></p>\n<h3>Known limitations</h3>\n<p>Due to a Typescript issue, inference of the output selector's parameters only works with <code>withTypes</code> when using an array of input selectors.</p>\n<p>If using the variadic version, you can either wrap your input selectors in an array instance (as above), or annotate the parameters manually.</p>\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>export const createAppSelector = createSelector.withTypes&lt;RootState&gt;();\n<p>export const selectPostById = createAppSelector(\n(state) =&gt; state.posts.entities,\n(state, id: number) =&gt; id,\n// parameters cannot be inferred, so need annotating\n(entities: Record&lt;number, Post&gt;, id: number) =&gt; entities[id],\n);\n</code></pre></p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce <code>identityFunctionCheck</code> false positives by <a href=\"https://github.com/Methuselah96\"><code>@‚ÄãMethuselah96</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/reselect/pull/660\">reduxjs/reselect#660</a></li>\n<li>Fix
