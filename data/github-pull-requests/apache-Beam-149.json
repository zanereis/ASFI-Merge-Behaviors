of changes:\r\n* added `py38`, `py38-cython` and `py38-cloud` tox suites (all suites pass)\r\n* made `preCommitPy38` a part of pythonPreCommit. I think it's acceptable to extend pythonPreCommit execution time and make sure the codebase supports Python 3.8 until we prioritize python versions.\r\n* `py37-docs` became a `py38-docs`\r\n* moved `formatter` task to py38\r\n\r\nI didn't change py37-lint to py38-lint, because this requires updating dependencies (for example, our current version of pycodestyle doesn't support Python 3.8)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Updates sql_test to require generating user types with an `id` field, which yields a name collision with the `id` added to generated NamedTuple types.\r\n- ~Modifies row_coder to extract values from NamedTuple instances as plain tuples, rather than using `getattr`. This fixes the above name collision.~ Dropped this change since it's not strictly necessary\r\n- Also, store schema id in an attribute called `_beam_schema_id` rather than `id` to avoid future name collisions.\r\n- Adds logic to set `_beam_schema_id` for provided (non-generated) user types as well as a test of this logic. This allows us to retrieve the same schema for the type in the future, rather than re-generating it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

if a file to stage is not found, the job will still launch, with no real chance of succeeding.\r\n\r\nThe value of `filesToStage` pipeline option (which is universal/global, since all options are universal/global) is used by `DataflowRunner` and `GcsStager` to mean \"files on classpath, with best-effort staging\".\r\n\r\nThis adds a check in `DataflowRunner` to fail if a file is not found.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of #11574. Includes an additional commit that ensures ExpansionService will never pick up PipelineOptions from `sys.argv` (the cause of [BEAM-9907](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9907)).\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that this PR does _not_ include support for passing pipeline options from Java to Python. This is more of a challenge since Java fails early for unknown options.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
