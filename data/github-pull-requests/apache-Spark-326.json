This was fixed by\r\n1. Refreshing peer cache in the block manager before trying to pro-actively replicate. This way the probability of replicating to a failed executor is eliminated.\r\n2. Explicitly stopping the block manager in the tests. This shuts down the RPC endpoint use by the block manager.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport a few cache related PRs: \r\n\r\n---\r\n[[SPARK-19093][SQL] Cached tables are not used in SubqueryExpression](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16493) \r\n\r\nConsider the plans inside subquery expressions while looking up cache manager to make\r\nuse of cached data. Currently CacheManager.useCachedData does not consider the\r\nsubquery expressions in the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n[[SPARK-19736][SQL] refreshByPath should clear all cached plans with the specified path](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17064)\r\n\r\nCatalog.refreshByPath can refresh the cache entry and the associated metadata for all dataframes (if any), that contain the given data source path.\r\n\r\nHowever, CacheManager.invalidateCachedPath doesn't clear all cached plans with the specified path. It causes some strange behaviors reported in SPARK-15678.\r\n\r\n---\r\n[[SPARK-19765][SPARK-18549][SQL] UNCACHE TABLE should un-cache all cached plans that refer to this table](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17097)\r\n\r\nWhen un-cache a table, we should not only remove the cache entry for this table, but also un-cache any other cached plans that refer to this table. The following commands trigger the table uncache: `DropTableCommand`, `TruncateTableCommand`, `AlterTableRenameCommand`, `UncacheTableCommand`, `RefreshTable` and `InsertIntoHiveTable`\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes some refactors:\r\n- use java.util.LinkedList to store the cache entries, so that it's safer to remove elements while iterating\r\n- rename invalidateCache to recacheByPlan, which is more obvious about what it does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A","created_at":"2017-03-16T18:07:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T15:17:20Z","closed_at":"2017-03-17T15:17:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60c0708df923e595091375dd84d5c5d962b62120","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11a8f31d5954c14eb8e546d001688f93357da676","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:backport-17097","ref":"backport-17097","sha":"11a8f31d5954c14eb8e546d001688f93357da676","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently JSON and CSV have exactly the same logic about handling bad records, this PR tries to abstract it and put it in a upper level to reduce code duplication.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is, we make the JSON and CSV parser to throw a BadRecordException, then the upper level, FailureSafeParser, handles bad records according to the parse mode.\r\n\r\nBehavior changes:\r\n1. with PERMISSIVE mode, if the number of tokens doesn't match the schema, previously CSV parser will treat it as a legal record and parse as many tokens as possible. After this PR, we treat it as an illegal record, and put the raw record string in a special column, but we still parse as many tokens as possible.\r\n2. all logging is removed as they are not very useful in practice.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the kerberized hadoop cluster, when Spark creates tables, the owner of tables are filled with PRINCIPAL strings instead of USER names. This is inconsistent with Hive and causes problems when using [ROLE](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization) in Hive. We had better to fix this.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"create table t(a int)\").show\r\nscala> sql(\"desc formatted t\").show(false)\r\n...\r\n|Owner:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support _not_ trimming the white spaces when writing out. These are `false` by default in CSV reading path but these are `true` by default in CSV writing in univocity parser.\r\n\r\nBoth `ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace` and `ignoreTrailingWhiteSpace` options are not being used for writing and therefore, we are always trimming the white spaces.\r\n\r\nIt seems we should provide a way to keep this white spaces easily.\r\n\r\nWIth the data below:\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.read.csv(Seq(\"a , b  , c\").toDS)\r\ndf.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+----+---+\r\n|_c0| _c1|_c2|\r\n+---+----+---+\r\n| a | b  |  c|\r\n+---+----+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.write.csv(\"/tmp/text.csv\")\r\nspark.read.text(\"/tmp/text.csv\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|a,b,c|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems this can't be worked around via `quoteAll` too.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.write.option(\"quoteAll\", true).csv(\"/tmp/text.csv\")\r\nspark.read.text(\"/tmp/text.csv\").show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+-----------+\r\n|      value|\r\n+-----------+\r\n|\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"|\r\n+-----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.write.option(\"ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace\", false).option(\"ignoreTrailingWhiteSpace\", false).csv(\"/tmp/text.csv\")\r\nspark.read.text(\"/tmp/text.csv\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------+\r\n|     value|\r\n+----------+\r\n|a , b  , c|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this case is possible in R\r\n\r\n```r\r\n> system(\"cat text.csv\")\r\nf1,f2,f3\r\na , b  , c\r\n> df <- read.csv(file=\"text.csv\")\r\n> df\r\n  f1   f2 f3\r\n1 a   b    c\r\n> write.csv(df, file=\"text1.csv\", quote=F, row.names=F)\r\n> system(\"cat text1.csv\")\r\nf1,f2,f3\r\na , b  , c\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `CSVSuite` and manual tests for Python.","created_at":"2017-03-16T08:07:15Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:43:37Z","closed_at":"2017-03-23T07:27:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d22daf5c1e5d22a351b1b413cecda45ea8304212","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e24bb6bc18fdca4075ba2646a27151360ed232c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-18579","ref":"SPARK-18579","sha":"8e24bb6bc18fdca4075ba2646a27151360ed232c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe previously hardcoded max 4 retries per stage is not suitable for all cluster configurations. Since spark retries a stage at the sign of the first fetch failure, you can easily end up with many stage retries to discover all the failures. In particular, two scenarios this value should change are (1) if there are more than 4 executors per node; in that case, it may take 4 retries to discover the problem with each executor on the node and (2) during cluster maintenance on large clusters, where multiple machines are serviced at once, but you also cannot afford total cluster downtime. By making this value configurable, cluster managers can tune this value to something more appropriate to their cluster configuration.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the following changes:\r\n1. Move `SparkHadoopWriter` to `core/internal/io/`, so that it's in the same directory with `SparkHadoopMapReduceWriter`;\r\n2. Move `SparkHadoopWriterUtils` to a separated file.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is merged, we may consolidate `SparkHadoopWriter` and `SparkHadoopMapReduceWriter`, and make the new commit protocol support the old `mapred` package's committer;\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by existing test cases.","created_at":"2017-03-15T12:04:10Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T06:42:03Z","closed_at":"2017-03-15T22:00:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2063814e8fe7030e3197bc0d88e0992f874b2724","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17304/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17304/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17304/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eee96782ab59108ae479a83cfc2476513bfc4c22","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:writer","ref":"writer","sha":"eee96782ab59108ae479a83cfc2476513bfc4c22","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `NullPointerException` in the generated code by Catalyst. When we run the following code, we get the following `NullPointerException`. This is because there is no null checks for `inputadapter_value`  while `java.lang.Long inputadapter_value` at Line 30 may have `null`.\r\n\r\nThis happen when a type of DataFrame is nullable primitive type such as `java.lang.Long` and the wholestage codegen is used. While the physical plan keeps `nullable=true` in `input[0, java.lang.Long, true].longValue`, `BoundReference.doGenCode` ignores `nullable=true`. Thus, nullcheck code will not be generated and `NullPointerException` will occur.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks the nullability and correctly generates nullcheck if

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch moves SQLConf from sql/core to sql/catalyst. To minimize the changes, the patch used type alias to still keep CatalystConf (as a type alias) and SimpleCatalystConf (as a concrete class that extends SQLConf).\r\n\r\nMotivation for the change is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a fetch failure occurs, the DAGScheduler re-launches the previous stage (to re-generate output that was missing), and then re-launches all tasks in the stage that haven't completed by the time the stage gets resubmitted (the DAGScheduler re-lanches all of the tasks whose output data is not available -- which is equivalent to the set of tasks that hadn't yet completed). This some times leads to wasteful duplicate task run for the jobs with long running task.\r\n\r\nTo address the issue following changes have been made.\r\n\r\nDag scheduler maintains a pending task list, which is a list of tasks that  have been submitted to the lower-level scheduler and they should not be resubmitted when rerun of the stage.\r\n\r\n1. When a fetch failure happens, the task set manager informs the dag scheduler to mark all the non-running tasks to the pending task list. However, the running tasks in the task set are not killed.\r\n2.

change modifies the way block data is encrypted to make the more\r\ncommon cases faster, while penalizing an edge case. As a side effect\r\nof the change, all data that goes through the block manager is now\r\nencrypted only when needed, including the previous path (broadcast\r\nvariables) where that did not happen.\r\n\r\nThe way the change works is by not encrypting data that is stored in\r\nmemory; so if a serialized block is in memory, it will only be encrypted\r\nonce it is evicted to disk.\r\n\r\nThe penalty comes when transferring that encrypted data from disk. If the\r\ndata ends up in memory again, it is as efficient as before; but if the\r\nevicted block needs to be transferred directly to a remote executor, then\r\nthere's now a performance penalty, since the code now uses a custom\r\nFileRegion implementation to decrypt the data before transferring.\r\n\r\nThis also means that block data transferred between executors now is\r\nnot encrypted (and thus relies on the network library encryption support\r\nfor secrecy). Shuffle blocks are still transferred in encrypted form,\r\nsince they're handled in a slightly different way by the code. This also\r\nkeeps compatibility with existing external shuffle services, which transfer\r\nencrypted shuffle blocks, and avoids having to make the external service\r\naware of encryption at all.\r\n\r\nThe serialization and deserialization APIs in the SerializerManager now\r\ndo not do encryption automatically; callers need to explicitly wrap their\r\nstreams with an appropriate crypto stream before using those.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these changes, some of the workarounds added in SPARK-19520\r\nare removed here.\r\n\r\nTesting: a new trait (\"EncryptionFunSuite\") was added that provides an easy\r\nway to run a test twice, with encryption on and off; broadcast, block manager\r\nand caching tests were modified to use this new trait so that the existing\r\ntests exercise both encrypted and non-encrypted paths. I also ran some\r\napplications with encryption turned on to verify that they still work,\r\nincluding streaming tests that failed without the fix for SPARK-19520.","created_at":"2017-03-14T21:39:55Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T18:12:12Z","closed_at":"2017-03-29T12:30:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1dd905b407ddd374acfe8c03575bcbc2fd2b5692","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17295/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17295/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17295/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a39cb23dae86d4289bf529c27dae21680620cab","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-19556","ref":"SPARK-19556","sha":"4a39cb23dae86d4289bf529c27dae21680620cab","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the following problem:\r\n````\r\nSeq((1, 2)).toDF(\"a1\", \"a2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"a\")\r\nSeq[(java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Integer)]((1, null)).toDF(\"b1\", \"b2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"b\")\r\n\r\n// The expected result is 1 row of (1,2) as shown in the next statement.\r\nsql(\"select * from a where a1 not in (select b1 from b where b2 = a2)\").show\r\n+---+---+\r\n| a1| a2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n+---+---+\r\n\r\nsql(\"select * from a where a1 not in (select b1 from b where b2 = 2)\").show\r\n+---+---+\r\n| a1| a2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n````\r\nThere are a number of scenarios to consider:\r\n\r\n1. When the correlated predicate yields a match (i.e., B.B2 = A.A2)\r\n1.1. When the NOT IN expression yields a match (i.e., A.A1 = B.B1)\r\n1.2. When the NOT IN expression yields no match (i.e., A.A1 = B.B1 returns false)\r\n1.3. When A.A1 is null\r\n1.4. When B.B1 is null\r\n1.4.1. When A.A1 is not null\r\n1.4.2. When A.A1 is null\r\n\r\n2. When the correlated predicate yields no match (i.e.,B.B2 = A.A2 is false or unknown)\r\n2.1. When B.B2 is null and A.A2 is null\r\n2.2. When B.B2 is null and A.A2 is not null\r\n2.3. When the value of A.A2 does not match any of B.B2\r\n\r\n````\r\n A.A1   A.A2      B.B1   B.B2    \r\n-----  -----     -----  -----\r\n    1      1         1      1    (1.1)\r\n    2      1                     (1.2)\r\n null      1                     (1.3)\r\n\r\n    1      3      null      3    (1.4.1)\r\n null      3                     (1.4.2)\r\n\r\n    1   null         1   null    (2.1)\r\n null      2                     (2.2 & 2.3)\r\n````\r\n\r\nWe can divide the evaluation of the above correlated NOT IN subquery into 2 groups:-\r\n\r\nGroup 1: The rows in A when there is a match from the correlated predicate (A.A1 = B.B1)\r\n\r\nIn this case, the result of the subquery is not empty and the semantics of the NOT IN depends solely on the evaluation of the equality comparison of the columns of NOT IN, i.e., A1 = B1, which says\r\n\r\n- If A.A1 is null, the row is filtered (1.3 and 1.4.2)\r\n- If A.A1 = B.B1, the row is filtered (1.1)\r\n- If B.B1 is null, any rows of A in the same group (A.A2 = B.B2) is filtered (1.4.1 & 1.4.2)\r\n- Otherwise, the row is qualified.\r\n\r\nHence, in this group, the result is the row from (1.2).\r\n\r\nGroup 2: The rows in A when there is no match from the correlated predicate (A.A2 = B.B2)\r\n\r\nIn this case, all the rows in A, including the rows where A.A1, are qualified because the subquery returns an empty set and by the semantics of the NOT IN, all rows from the parent side qualifies as the result set, that is, the rows from (2.1, 2.2 and 2.3).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the correct result set of the above query is\r\n````\r\n A.A1   A.A2\r\n-----  -----\r\n    2      1    (1.2)\r\n    1   null    (2.1)\r\n null      2    (2.2 & 2.3)\r\n````\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit tests, regression tests, and new test cases focusing on the problem being fixed.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-14T17:13:31Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T21:06:10Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T19:37:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83bd28fed4795802d4bff1c532db662abe984ca1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17294/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17294/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17294/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/507b2fa3743ae0e6a70547056b0600700d6f602e","head":{"label":"nsyca:18966","ref":"18966","sha":"507b2fa3743ae0e6a70547056b0600700d6f602e","user":{"login":"nsyca","id":18035343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM1MzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18035343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca","html_url":"https://github.com/nsyca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64500866,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDUwMDg2Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"nsyca/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsyca","id":18035343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM1MzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18035343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca","html_url":"https://github.com/nsyca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nsyca/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a problem that was reported in [Databricks forum](https://forums.databricks.com/questions/7123/nullable-seemingly-ignored-when-reading-parquet.html).  When the following code is executed, a schema for ``id`` has ``nullable = true`` while `read.schema()` specifies ``nullable = false``.\r\n\r\nI realized this is because current Spark sets `true` into ``nullable`` in its schema for file-based data source. This PR makes this conservative setting precise.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nval field = \"id\"\r\nval df = spark.range(0, 5, 1, 1).toDF(field)\r\nval fmt = \"parquet\"\r\nval path = \"/tmp/parquet\"\r\nval schema = StructType(Seq(StructField(field, LongType, false)))\r\ndf.write.format(fmt).mode(\"overwrite\").save(path)\r\nval dfRead = spark.read.format(fmt).schema(schema).load(path)\r\ndfRead.printSchema\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded new test in `DataFrameReaderWriterSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-14T16:22:53Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T16:28:33Z","closed_at":"2017-07-05T17:10:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9587907902219ca48d0416518e9db792598e6502","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6837eb3a5438caba1d0319949fe7b0bcecef7a43","head":{"label":"kiszk:SPARK-19950","ref":"SPARK-19950","sha":"6837eb3a5438caba1d0319949fe7b0bcecef7a43","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently `SessionCatalogSuite` is only for `InMemoryCatalog`, there is no suite for `HiveExternalCatalog`.\r\nAnd there are some ddl function is not proper to test in `ExternalCatalogSuite`, because some logic are not full implement in `ExternalCatalog`, these ddl functions are full implement in `SessionCatalog`(e.g. merge the same logic from `ExternalCatalog` up to `SessionCatalog` ).\r\nIt is better to test it in `SessionCatalogSuite` for this situation.\r\n\r\nSo we should add a test suite for `SessionCatalog` with `HiveExternalCatalog`\r\n\r\nThe main change is that in `SessionCatalogSuite` add two functions:\r\n`withBasicCatalog` and `withEmptyCatalog`\r\nAnd replace the code like  `val catalog = new SessionCatalog(newBasicCatalog)` with above two functions\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have some concerns about removing size in the cost model [in the previous pr](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17240). It's a tradeoff between code structure and algorithm completeness. I tend to keep the size and thus create this new pr without changing cost model.\r\n\r\nWhat this pr does:\r\n1. It deals with consecutive inner joinable items. During reordering, it excludes cartesian products in reordering procedure. \r\nGiven A Join B on A.key = B.key Join C on B.value = C.value:\r\nlevel 0: {A}, {B}, {C}\r\nlevel 1: {A, B}, ~~{A, C}~~, {B, C}\r\nlevel 2: {A, B, C}\r\nWhen the number of items increases, this significantly reduces the search space and memory overhead of memo. Otherwise every combination of items will exist in the memo.\r\n\r\n2. This pr also includes a bug fix: if an item (basic reordering unit) is a project(_, child), current solution will lost the project.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test cases.","created_at":"2017-03-14T08:22:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T02:48:41Z","closed_at":"2017-03-18T06:09:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0fff389b43ffa59a5721ccb98578daa5f66080c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aa75b6edc0803b537c46a730a1cc9e2b8ac424a4","head":{"label":"wzhfy:joinReorder3","ref":"joinReorder3","sha":"aa75b6edc0803b537c46a730a1cc9e2b8ac424a4","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `RemoveRedundantAlias` rule can change the output attributes (the expression id's to be precise) of a query by eliminating the redundant alias producing them. This is no problem for a regular query, but can cause problems for correlated subqueries: The attributes produced by the subquery are used in the parent plan; changing them will break the parent plan.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by wrapping a subquery in a `Subquery` top level node when it gets optimized. The `RemoveRedundantAlias` rule now recognizes `Subquery` and makes sure that the output attributes of the `Subquery` node are retained.\r\n \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test case to `RemoveRedundantAliasAndProjectSuite` and added a regression test to `SubquerySuite`.","created_at":"2017-03-13T16:28:05Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T17:54:29Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T17:54:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45e535ffd65a8b3d33b1076b48a28852aa476388","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17278/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17278/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17278/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e460b6c3c5544f856bd3ed4da69833894ef8c08","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-19933","ref":"SPARK-19933","sha":"3e460b6c3c5544f856bd3ed4da69833894ef8c08","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis JIRA is a follow up work after [SPARK-19583](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19583)\r\n\r\nAs we discussed in that [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16938)\r\n\r\nThe following DDL for a managed table with an existed default location should throw an exception:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE ... (PARTITIONED BY ...) AS SELECT ...\r\nCREATE TABLE ... (PARTITIONED BY ...)\r\n```\r\nCurrently there are some situations which are not consist with above logic:\r\n\r\n1. CREATE TABLE ... (PARTITIONED BY ...) succeed with an existed default location\r\nsituation: for both hive/datasource(with HiveExternalCatalog/InMemoryCatalog)\r\n\r\n2. CREATE TABLE ... (PARTITIONED BY ...) AS SELECT ...\r\nsituation: hive table succeed with an existed default location\r\n\r\nThis PR is going to make above two situations consist with the logic that it should throw an exception\r\nwith an existed default location.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit test

generating synonyms using a large model (I've tested with 3m words) is very slow. These efficiencies have sped things up for us by ~17%\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure if such small changes were worthy of a jira, but the guidelines seemed to suggest that that is the preferred approach\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAddress a few small issues in the findSynonyms logic:\r\n1) remove usage of ``Array.fill`` to zero out the ``cosineVec`` array. The default float value in Scala and Java is 0.0f, so explicitly setting the values to zero is not needed\r\n2) use Floats throughout. The conversion to Doubles before doing the ``priorityQueue`` is totally superfluous, since all the similarity computations are done using Floats anyway. Creating a second large array just serves to put extra strain on the GC\r\n3) convert the slow ``for(i <- cosVec.indices)`` to an ugly, but faster, ``while`` loop\r\n\r\nThese efficiencies are really only apparent when working with a large model\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests + some in-house tests to time the difference\r\n\r\ncc @jkbradley @MLNick @srowen

This PR allows the test cases in sql/hive to pass the existing Hive client to create a SparkSession. \r\n- Since Derby does not allow concurrent connections, the pre-built Hive clients use different database from the TestHive's built-in 1.2.1 client. \r\n- Since our test cases in sql/hive only can create a single Spark context in the same JVM, the newly created SparkSession share the same spark context with the existing TestHive's corresponding SparkSession. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFixed the existing test cases.","created_at":"2017-03-11T19:22:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T06:21:34Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T06:21:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdac6f1c86396d88c66e4092c5627636a18223f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e0887d0568eb04392801f0d44901b4bb1d555cf6","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:versionSuite","ref":"versionSuite","sha":"e0887d0568eb04392801f0d44901b4bb1d555cf6","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to defer throwing the exception within `DataSource`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if other datasources fail to infer the schema, it returns `None` and then this is being validated in `DataSource` as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.read.json(\"emptydir\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Unable to infer schema for JSON. It must be specified manually.;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.read.orc(\"emptydir\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Unable to infer schema for ORC. It must be specified manually.;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"emptydir\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Unable to infer schema for Parquet. It must be specified manually.;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, CSV it checks it within the datasource implementation and throws another exception message as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use text datasource when Json schema inference.\r\n\r\nThis basically proposes the similar approach in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15813 If we use Dataset for initial loading when inferring the schema, there are advantages. Please refer SPARK-18362\r\n\r\nIt seems JSON one was supposed to be fixed together but taken out according to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15813\r\n\r\n> A similar problem also affects the JSON file format and this patch originally fixed that as well, but I've decided to split that change into a separate patch so as not to conflict with changes in another JSON PR.\r\n\r\nAlso, this seems affecting some functionalities because it does not use `FileScanRDD`. This problem is described in SPARK-19885 (but it was CSV's case).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover this and manual test by `spark.read.json(path)` and check the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen batches are executed with memory, console or foreach format, `assertNotPartitioned` will check whether output is not partitioned and throw AnalysisException in case it is.\r\n\r\nBut I wonder it's better to log warning rather than throw the exception because partitioning does not affect output for those formats but also does not bring any negative impacts.\r\n\r\nAlso, this assertion is not applied when the format is `console`. I think in this case too, we should assert that .\r\n\r\nBy fixing them, we can easily switch the format to memory or console for debug purposes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested manually for memory, foreach and console formats and confirm that warning is displayed.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-11T00:03:52Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T20:45:46Z","closed_at":"2017-03-23T01:00:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0978a54996cb905eaddd2c41da9a6fe7e11097ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17252/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17252/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17252/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/01ad04a84655d779940bdc0487a58028d1ef3771","head":{"label":"sarutak:SPARK-19913","ref":"SPARK-19913","sha":"01ad04a84655d779940bdc0487a58028d1ef3771","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe ```HiveMetastoreCatalog.mergeWithMetastoreSchema()``` method added in #16944 may\r\nnot preserve the same field order as the metastore schema in some cases, which can cause\r\nqueries to fail. This change ensures that the metastore field order is preserved.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA test for ensuring that metastore order is preserved was added to ```HiveSchemaInferenceSuite.```\r\nThe particular failure usecase from #16944 was tested manually as well.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-10T21:12:33Z","updated_at":"2017-03-24T21:48:21Z","closed_at":"2017-03-10T23:21:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3f321048475b2eb7e226e76d934c4e36ef695f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/99eb2dc9b07e953249b4ece6ea3a44ecebc9287b","head":{"label":"budde:PreserveMetastoreFieldOrder","ref":"PreserveMetastoreFieldOrder","sha":"99eb2dc9b07e953249b4ece6ea3a44ecebc9287b","user":{"login":"budde","id":798699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde","html_url":"https://github.com/budde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":25752964,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTc1Mjk2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"budde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"budde","id":798699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde","html_url":"https://github.com/budde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/budde/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`Dataset.inputFiles` works by matching `FileRelation`s in the query plan. In Spark 2.1, Hive SerDe tables are represented by `MetastoreRelation`, which inherits from `FileRelation`. However, in Spark 2.2, Hive SerDe tables are now represented by `CatalogRelation`, which doesn't inherit from `FileRelation` anymore, due to the unification of Hive SerDe tables and data source tables. This change breaks `Dataset.inputFiles` for Hive SerDe tables.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix this issue by explicitly matching `CatalogRelation`s that are Hive SerDe tables in `Dataset.inputFiles`. Note that we can't make `CatalogRelation` inherit from `FileRelation` since not all `CatalogRelation`s are file based (e.g., JDBC data source tables).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test case added in `HiveDDLSuite`.","created_at":"2017-03-10T19:46:56Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T23:21:04Z","closed_at":"2017-03-10T23:21:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5317a67bf553b8215468f4030baabd84561d88d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17247/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17247/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17247/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e24047e37f24cfbfa3a4a3234bbd41837da93ed","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-19905-hive-table-input-files","ref":"spark-19905-hive-table-input-files","sha":"7e24047e37f24cfbfa3a4a3234bbd41837da93ed","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe currently cannot use aliases in SQL function calls. This is inconvenient when you try to create a struct. This SQL query for example `select struct(1, 2) st`, will create a struct with column names `col1` and `col2`. This is even more problematic when we want to append a field to an existing struct. For example if we want to a field to struct `st` we would issue the following SQL query `select struct(st.*, 1) as st from src`, the result will be struct `st` with an a column with a non descriptive name `col3` (if `st` itself has 2 fields).\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change this by allowing the use of aliased expression in function parameters. For example `select struct(1 as a, 2 as b) st`, will create a struct with columns `a` & `b`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to `ExpressionParserSuite` and added a test file for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt is sometimes useful to use multiple threads in a task to parallelize tasks. These threads might register some completion/failure listeners to clean up when the task completes or fails. We currently cannot register such a callback and be sure that it will get called, because the context might be in the process of invoking its callbacks, when the the callback gets registered.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves this by making sure that you cannot add a completion/failure listener from a different thread when the context is being marked as completed/failed in another thread. This is done by synchronizing these methods on the task context itself.\r\n\r\nFailure listeners were called only once. Completion listeners now follow the same pattern; this lifts the idempotency requirement for completion listeners and makes it easier to implement them. In some cases we can (accidentally) add a completion/failure listener after the fact, these listeners will be called immediately in order make sure we can safely clean-up after a task.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this change we could make the `failure` and `completed` flags non-volatile. The `isCompleted()` method now uses synchronization to ensure that updates are visible across threads.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdding tests to `TaskContestSuite` to test adding listeners to a completed/failed context.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-10T15:02:11Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T03:24:40Z","closed_at":"2017-03-15T09:48:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7af713b8a3eb9516ecf755f07cbae8bafd822b8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17244/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17244/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17244/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4199619f04dbd01c62fffe86b403f5fedc46c76e","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-19889","ref":"SPARK-19889","sha":"4199619f04dbd01c62fffe86b403f5fedc46c76e","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Usually cardinality is more important than size, we can simplify cost evaluation by using only cardinality. Note that this also enables us to not care about column pruing during reordering. Because otherwise, project will influence the output size of intermediate joins.\r\n2. Do column pruning during reordering is troublesome. Given the first change, we can do it right after reordering, then logics for adding projects on intermediate joins can be removed. This makes the code simpler and more reliable.\r\n3. Exclude cartesian products in the \"memo\". This significantly reduces the search space and memory overhead of memo. Otherwise every combination of items will exist in the memo. We can find those unjoinable items after reordering is finished and put them at the end.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19894\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt tests on our production cluster(YARN) by YARN-cluster mode, and resolve user rack-local problems by applying this patch.\r\nProblem:\r\nIn our production cluster(YARN), one node(called missing-rack-info node) miss some rack information for other nodes. One Spark Streaming program(Datasource: Kafka, Mode: Yarn-cluster), runs driver on this missing-rack-info node.\r\nThe nodes whose host is missed on Driver node, and the Kafka broker node whose host is also unknown by YARN, would both be recognized as \"/default-rack\" by YARN scheduler, so that all tasks would be assigned to the nodes for RACK_LOCAL.","created_at":"2017-03-10T07:34:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T15:46:37Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T15:46:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7daffaec6c2ca9b6b119929825b5456249699af0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6630e747efa52bff5ca48bb0a5610357c7754c10","head":{"label":"charliechen211:master","ref":"master","sha":"6630e747efa52bff5ca48bb0a5610357c7754c10","user":{"login":"charliechen211","id":5773445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzM0NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5773445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211","html_url":"https://github.com/charliechen211","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":84515296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NDUxNTI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"charliechen211/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"charliechen211","id":5773445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzM0NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5773445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211","html_url":"https://github.com/charliechen211","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charliechen211/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/charliechen211/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to support reading data from Hive 2.1 metastore. Need to update shim class because of the Hive API changes caused by the following three Hive JIRAs:\r\n- [HIVE-12730 MetadataUpdater: provide a mechanism to edit the basic statistics of a table (or a partition)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12730)\r\n- [Hive-13341 Stats state is not captured correctly: differentiate load table and create table](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13341)\r\n- [HIVE-13622 WriteSet tracking optimizations](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13622)\r\n\r\nThere are three new fields added to Hive APIs.  \r\n- `boolean hasFollowingStatsTask`. We always set it to `false`. This is to keep the existing behavior unchanged (starting from 0.13), no matter which Hive metastore client version users choose. If we set it to `true`, the basic table statistics is not collected by Hive. For example,\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\n\tCREATE TABLE tbl AS SELECT 1 AS a\r\n```\r\nWhen setting `hasFollowingStatsTask ` to `false`, the table properties is like \r\n```\r\n\tProperties: [numFiles=1, transient_lastDdlTime=1489513927, totalSize=2]\r\n```\r\nWhen setting `hasFollowingStatsTask ` to `true`, the table properties is like \r\n```\r\n\tProperties: [transient_lastDdlTime=1489513563]\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `AcidUtils.Operation operation`. Obviously, we do not support ACID. Thus, we set it to `AcidUtils.Operation.NOT_ACID`.\r\n- `EnvironmentContext environmentContext`. So far, this is always set to `null`. This was introduced for supporting DDL `alter table s update statistics set ('numRows'='NaN')`. Using this DDL, users can specify the statistics. So far, our Spark SQL does not need it, because we use different table properties to store our generated statistics values. However, when Spark SQL issues ALTER TABLE DDL statements, Hive metastore always automatically invalidate the Hive-generated statistics. \r\n\r\nIn the follow-up PR, we can fix it by explicitly adding a property to `environmentContext`.\r\n```JAVA\r\nputToProperties(StatsSetupConst.STATS_GENERATED, StatsSetupConst.USER)\r\n```\r\nAnother alternative is to set `DO_NOT_UPDATE_STATS`to `TRUE`. See the Hive JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15653. We will not address it in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch allows to use arbitrary input and output formats when streaming data to and from the piped process. The API uses java.io.Data{Input,Output} for I/O, therefore all methods operating on multibyte primitives assume big-endian byte order.\r\n\r\nThe change is fully backward-compatible in terms of both public API and behaviour. Additionally, existing line-based format is available via TextInputWriter/TextOutputReader.\r\n\r\n## Why is it worth merging?\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch the only way to stream binary data (think ProtoBuf records or NumPy arrays) from PipedRDD was via Base64. The piped process had to Base64-encode the output, which would then be Base64-decoded on the Spark side. Apart from wasting CPU cycles on the executors, Base64 increases the output of the piped process by 25%. The new API allows to get rid of this overhead.\r\n\r\nNote that Hadoop streaming has undergone a similar change in the past. The text-only I/O format was [complemented](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-1722) by two binary formats: typedbytes and rawbytes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPipedRDD unit tests and in-house integration tests.","created_at":"2017-03-09T23:24:38Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T15:07:48Z","closed_at":"2017-12-07T15:08:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7f5f251f4f079c1fe7dec20bbb3eb53427ac775","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1265fda3c7399a635b985565b0d915d901d48382","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:pipe-binary-io-upstream","ref":"pipe-binary-io-upstream","sha":"1265fda3c7399a635b985565b0d915d901d48382","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

a new configuration option that allows Spark SQL to infer a case-sensitive schema from a Hive Metastore table's data files when a case-sensitive schema can't be read from the table properties.\r\n\r\n- Add spark.sql.hive.caseSensitiveInferenceMode param to SQLConf\r\n- Add schemaPreservesCase field to CatalogTable (set to false when schema can't\r\n  successfully be read from Hive table props)\r\n- Perform schema inference in HiveMetastoreCatalog if schemaPreservesCase is\r\n  false, depending on spark.sql.hive.caseSensitiveInferenceMode\r\n- Add alterTableSchema() method to the ExternalCatalog interface\r\n- Add HiveSchemaInferenceSuite tests\r\n- Refactor and move ParquetFileForamt.meregeMetastoreParquetSchema() as\r\n  HiveMetastoreCatalog.mergeWithMetastoreSchema\r\n- Move schema merging tests from ParquetSchemaSuite to HiveSchemaInferenceSuite\r\n\r\n[JIRA for this change](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19611)\r\n\r\nThe tests in ```HiveSchemaInferenceSuite``` should verify that schema inference is working as expected. ```ExternalCatalogSuite``` has
