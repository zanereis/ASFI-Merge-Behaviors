For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Modified the deserialization of DynamicCoordinatorConfig\r\n\r\nThe coordinator now uses the `DynamicCoordinatorConfig.Builder.class` for deserialization of the dynamic coordinator config. This allows us to automatically use the Builder specified default for a configuration key that does not exist in the metastore payload for the dynamic config. Doing so ensures that an \"incomplete\" config in the metastore will be supplemented with the proper Druid specified defaults every time it is deserialized.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, Druid used `DynamicCoordinatorConfig.class` directly for deserialization. The drawback on this is that `DynamicCoordinatorConfig` is less equipped for cleanly handling missing configuration keys during deserialization. If a developer used a Java primitive when adding a new config, on upgrade, the deserialization would use the Java system default for a missing value. This is often times very bad! For instance, I might add `newIntConfig` to Druid. Since this isn't in the previous version of Druid, upgrading the coordinator would cause deserialization of the legacy config to populate newIntConfig with the value `0`. But as a developer, I needed `newIntConfig` to default to 100. To work-a-round this, I would flip the type to `Integer` which would deserialize a missing value as `null`. I could then check for this null value in the constructor and replace it with the desired default from the Builder class constants. You can see a more realistic example of this work-a-round [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/bb3c810b368f2f49d33d24df38b078640d7d38d4#diff-3119db307661e92f88879f6465bfa3229f9e5c8cce0fa11c9487b2d7ded87fd7R140) Another reference to this conditional null check comes up in [this](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12504#discussion_r887380372) thread.\r\n\r\nMy change gets us away from this pattern. We are catching an undesirable state and deferring to the default in the Builder class already... so why not just use the Builder for deserialization is my thought. This way we can leverage the built in patterns for handling nulls and replacing them with constant defaults there instead of the `DynamicCoordinatorConfig` \r\n\r\nMy one worry is that I am missing an angle here that required us to forgo the Builder for this deserialization. At first instance, I figured that serialization used the same `ConfigManager` watcher and that using the builder for serde would cause issues in writing the config. However, this does not seem to be the case after running automated tests, manual review of the config update code path, and testing this change in my local druid cluster. Still, perhaps I am overlooking something that has prevented us from using the builder. That is what I'm hoping the review process can smoke out.\r\n\r\n#### What I did not touch in this PR\r\n\r\nI did not alter any of the code in the `CoordinatorDynamicConfig` constructor that is performing the deserialization work-a-round that my update is intended to prevent. I could certainly make that change here as well, but I wanted to be conservative with the scope of this change and guarantee no change in behavior of existing code. Removing the conditional checks on null and changing the variables to primitive types would change behavior IF there were any use of the `CoordinatorDynamicConfig` constructor directly. To my knowledge, unit tests are the only place this still happens.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes an issue where when you look at the sql query request logs emitted via an emitter or logged would be missing default query context values set in runtime.properties\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis was chosen because while the default query context is added as part of QueryLifecycle it was never added as part of the sql lifecycle meaning it wouldn't show up in the logs or when emitted via an emitter. Since this is a duplicate value with the values being added at QueryLifecycle there should no worries about the eventual double write of default query context values\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SqlLifecycle`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

However, the error is too technical for the users and doesn't suggest them to check for missing extensions. This PR modifies the error message so users can at least check their settings before assuming that the error is because of a bug. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Made an incompatible change to druid_segments table\r\n\r\nAdded a new column, ~`last_used VARCHAR(255)`~ `used_flag_last_updated VARCHAR(255)` to the druid_segments table. When creating the druid_segments table from scratch, this column is not nullable. However, to more easily facilitate an upgrade to a version of Druid with this code, the migration steps to ALTER druid_segments allow the column to have null values. ~Perhaps we can document an optional post upgrade step to ALTER the table to not allow nulls that is contingent upon completing the existing optional post-upgrade step to populate last_used for already unused rows.~ The coordinator will incrementally update these nulls to valid date strings for all already unused segments post-upgrade. This automatically brings the metastore into compliance with the new version of druid.\r\n\r\nThis column is a UTC date string corresponding to the last time that the `used` column was modified.\r\n\r\n#### Added a configuration to the `druid.coordinator.kill.` family, `druid.coordinator.kill.bufferPeriod`\r\n\r\n`druid.coordinator.kill.bufferPeriod` is a Duration that defines the amount of time that a segment must have been unused for before KillUnusedSegments will potentially kill it. For example, with the default `PT24H`. If I mark a segment X unused at `2022-06-01T00:05:00.000Z`. By rule, this segment cannot be killed until at or after `2022-06-02T00:05:00.000Z`.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent use of this new configuration is to prevent deletion of data from Druid by mistake. It can be thought of like the trash folder in HDFS. Marking segments unused is the `rm`. Without trash, the data is just gone. With trash, we can recover. The period is the amount of time before pending trash sent away for good.\r\n\r\n#### Added a single threaded Executor on the coordinator for updating null values of new column\r\n\r\nSegments who are already unused at the time of the upgrade will have a null value for `used_flag_last_updated`. In this state, these segments will never be killed. The Coordinator will start a background thread to update all of these null values for segments who are already marked unused (segments with null values who are still used don't need a valid date string for this column. They will get one if/when they are marked unused).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Design\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I could have embedded last_used within the payload. The functionality at the end of the day would be the same, but I have listed some pros and cons below.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n* No table schema change needed to upgrade Druid, making life easier for an operator.\r\n\r\nCons\r\n* If you were adding this feature in the initial pre-release development of Druid, you'd probably steer away from accumulating too much in the payload column and instead create native columns in the database table\r\n  * embedding it in this column is almost hiding it. Or at least making it harder for others to discover and understand. \r\n* You need to pull the payload back in the query for unused segments. Increased db I/O, network, druid memory and compute demands\r\n* You need to process the payloads in Druid code instead of simply filtering on the column value if it were native to the metastore table\r\n\r\n#### Upgrade Plan\r\n\r\n~Requiring a database table alteration is a breaking change. It introduces an extra requirement for an operator to upgrade from an older version of Druid. I have done my best to limit the complexity of upgrading and provide as much assistance as possible to the Druid operators out there.~\r\n\r\nRequiring a database table alteration is a breaking change for any cluster whose coordinator doesn't have DDL permission on startup. If there are no such privileges, the operator of the cluster will need to handle adding the column in order to update to 0.24+. I have done my best to limit the complexity of upgrading and provide as much assistance as possible to the Druid operators out there.\r\n\r\n##### No work necessary case\r\n\r\nThere is a case where there is no extra work necessary for the Druid operator to upgrade. If the operator has used the default of `true` for `druid.metadata.storage.connector.createTables`, and their metastore user has DDL privs, the table will automatically be altered at startup if the ~`last_used`~ `used_flag_last_updated` column is missing from the druid_segments table.\r\n\r\nThe coordinator and overlord will startup just fine. And all future changes to the used column (plus new segment creation) will populate ~`last_used`~ `used_flag_last_updated`. For existing segments who match `used = true`, the value of ~`last_used`~ `used_flag_last_updated` will be `null`. ~I have coded up the logic for finding segments to kill in a way that ignores the bufferPeriod for these segments with `null` column values. This means that `KillUnusedSegments` will use the same logic as pre-upgrade when looking for killable segments in the metadata store.~ The segment killing mechanism will ignore these rows with null `used_flag_last_updated`. The Coordinator will eventually populate the column with a real date string, thus starting the bufferPeriod clock.\r\n\r\n##### Some work necessary case\r\n\r\nIf the operator has either:\r\n* set `druid.metadata.storage.connector.createTables` to false\r\n* not given their metastore user DDL privs\r\n\r\nThey will need to execute an ALTER statement themselves before the upgrade. To make things easy for them, I have created a new Druid cli tool called UpdateTables that can perform this for them by executing the same alter table code path as the no work necessary case described above. This tool, as well as the actual ALTER command - in case the operator wants to do it themselves - is documented in a new upgrade-prep.md resource.\r\n\r\n##### Optional post upgrade action\r\n\r\n~If the operator is interested in populating all of their legacy unused segments with a last_used date string following the upgrade, I have included another action in the new UpdateTables cli tool that will do so. Again, I have documented the tool and provided the actual UPDATE statement that they could use manually. This step is completely optional and only needed if the operator desires that their legacy unused segments come under the purview of the new bufferPeriod config post-upgrade.~\r\n\r\nThis is no longer required now that the coordinator will handle populating `used_flag_last_updated` with already unused segments at the time of the upgrade.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This can be improved by just peek the top and do shiftDown if needed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\nSQL expressions such as those containing `MV_FILTER_ONLY` and `MV_FILTER_NONE`\r\nare planned as specialized virtual columns instead of the default `expression` type virtual columns.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new context parameter that can be used to plan such SQL expressions as\r\nexpression-type virtual columns based on the default native expression.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful for:\r\n- comparing performances of specialized virtual columns with the expression virtual columns\r\n- using the EXPLAIN PLAN as a translation mechanism from SQL to native expressions\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add query context param `forceExpressionVirtualColumns`\r\n- Use context param to determine if specialized virtual columns should be used or not\r\n- Moved some tests into `CalciteExplainQueryTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes 2 bugs, and made another one apparent, but I'm not quite sure how to fix it yet so might have to save it for a follow-up.\r\n\r\nThe first bug is around overzealous cycle detection in virtual columns, which would prevent some expressions which did not contain cycles, because it did not discern between virtual column inputs from segment columns. Given an expression like\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase_searched(notnull(1 + x), v1, v2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `v1` and `v2` are virtual columns, if either virtual column referenced `x`, prior to this PR it would be classified incorrectly as a cycle and throw an exception.\r\n\r\nThe query that uncovered this issue was actually a query similar to \r\n```\r\nCOALESCE(MV_FILTER_ONLY(dim3, ARRAY['b']), MV_FILTER_ONLY(dim3, ARRAY['c']))\r\n```\r\n\r\nand while investigating I noticed planned to the form\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase_searched(notnull(filter((x) -> array_contains(array('b'), x), \\\"dim3\\\")),\\\"v1\\\",\\\"v2\\\")\r\n```\r\nwhich given the virtual column specialization code I would have expected to actually plan to \r\n```\r\ncase_searched(notnull(\\\"v1\\\"),\\\"v1\\\",\\\"v2\\\")\r\n```\r\nwhich is the 2nd bug fixed, a missing call to `DruidExpression.visit` in the `visitAll` code, meaning the specialization code isn't actually traversing the whole tree.\r\n\r\n While writing a test to fix this 2nd issue, I encountered a 3rd issue involving the way grouping works whe the `ListFilteredVirtualColumn` is used as an expression input, but I think could happen with any dimension selector that returns `IndexedInts` as 0 length rows, and is using the \"deferred\" evaluation expression selector (which saves expression evaluation until after the grouping). However, the 0 length row is grouped as the \"missing\" value, which means that there is no dictionary id to lookup - which is what evaluates the expression in the deferred expression dimension selectors, and so this null value is not actually used as an input to an expression and so remains null. I'm still trying to determine the best way to fix this problem. As far as I can tell, it should only affect the \"deferred\" evaluation expression dimension selectors when used with a grouping engine and delegating to any selector that can return an `IndexedInts` of size 0 for the row.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-29T08:57:55Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:11:47Z","closed_at":"2022-05-31T06:51:22Z","merged_at":"2022-05-31T06:51:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"b746bf91298e704c16375a60df73bd73fe4e2309","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area - SQL","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

type %s to %s\", obj.getClass().getName(), ComparableList.class.getName());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nI.e. it doesn't know about arrays.

a default implementation of getQueryContext, which was added to the Query interface in #12396. Query is marked with @ExtensionPoint, and lately we have been trying to be less volatile on these interfaces by providing default implementations to be more chill for extension writers.\r\n\r\nThe way this default implementation is done in this PR is a bit strange due to the way that getQueryContext is used (mutated with system default and system generated keys); the default implementation has a specific object that it returns, and I added another temporary default method isLegacyContext that checks if the getQueryContext returns that object or not. If not, callers fall back to using getContext and withOverriddenContext to set these default and system values.\r\n\r\nI am open to other ideas as well, but this way should work at least without exploding, and added some tests to ensure that it is wired up correctly for QueryLifecycle, including the context authorization stuff.\r\n\r\nThe added test shows the strange behavior if query context authorization is enabled, mainly that the system default and system generated query context keys also need to be granted as permissions for things to function correctly. This is not great, so I mentioned it in the javadocs as well. Not sure if it needs to be called out anywhere else.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

a default implementation of `getQueryContext`, which was added to the `Query` interface in #12396. `Query` is marked with `@ExtensionPoint`, and lately we have been trying to be less volatile on these interfaces by providing default implementations to be more chill for extension writers. \r\n\r\nThe way this default implementation is done in this PR is a bit strange due to the way that `getQueryContext` is used (mutated with system default and system generated keys); the default implementation has a specific object that it returns, and I added another temporary default method `isLegacyContext` that checks if the `getQueryContext` returns that object or not. If not, callers fall back to using `getContext` and `withOverriddenContext` to set these default and system values.\r\n\r\n I am open to other ideas as well, but this way should work at least without exploding, and added some tests to ensure that it is wired up correctly for `QueryLifecycle`, including the context authorization stuff.\r\n\r\nThe added test shows the strange behavior if query context authorization is enabled, mainly that the system default and system generated query context keys also need to be granted as permissions for things to function correctly. This is not great, so I mentioned it in the javadocs as well. Not sure if it needs to be called out anywhere else.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-24T22:28:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T10:50:15Z","closed_at":"2022-05-25T09:54:42Z","merged_at":"2022-05-25T09:54:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0c9c37e354df3b4cd8c580c528026ebabb79968","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new property `druid.request.logging.durationToRetain` that provides support to specify retention periods for request logs stored on disk. This property works only for the file-based request logger and the retention period must be at least 1 day so that it avoids deleting the request log for the current day.

Added the array handling as part of this PR. \r\n\r\nAlso, there is another code path that knows about arrays. but that has a typo. \r\n```java\r\nObjects[] objects = (Objects[]) obj;\r\n    String[] delegate = new String[objects.length];\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < objects.length; i++) {\r\n      delegate[i] = convertObjectToString(objects[i]);\r\n    }\r\n    return ComparableStringArray.of(delegate);\r\n```\r\n\r\nit should be `object[]` and not `objects[]`. \r\nAdded test cases to handle this case along with the change. \r\n\r\nThanks, @imply-cheddar for finding this bug. \r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This field is important to reduce and optimize memory usage, particularly for data sources with many dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe bug has been identified on the following classes:\r\n\r\n- server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/client/indexing/ClientCompactionTaskQueryTuningConfig.java\r\n- server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/coordinator/UserCompactionTaskQueryTuningConfig.java\r\n\r\nBoth of these classes are missing the maxColumnsToMerge property.\r\n\r\nA fix was implemented to add the missing property to these two classes. The fix was tested succesfully in our environment.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\n\r\nConverted to draft temporarily as some of the generic changes were split out into separate PRs.\r\n\r\nSQL planners are complex and difficult to test. They are a black box: SQL goes in, and results come out. From a testing perspective, a planner tends to be a box of magic that either works or doesn’t. This PR provides a framework to turn classic black-box planner testing into a white-box experience by capturing and verifying the multiple planner artifacts. The framework is inspired by the one used in Apache Impala.\r\n\r\nThe core idea is the “case” file which contains SQL statements, any required query context or options, and expected results, serialized as text. Expected results include the Calcite plan, the native query, the schema, the “physical plan” (such as it is in Druid), and so on.\r\n\r\nCreating tests is easy. This PR includes a “starter set” captured from the various `Calcite?QueryTest` classes. To add a new one, add a test case with a query, add dummy values for the desired artifacts and run the test. It will fail, of course. Now, use your favorite diff tool to copy the “actual” results to the “expected” results file (assuming the results are correct.) After that, rerun the tests after each planner change to ensure nothing changes (except whatever you specifically wanted to change.)\r\n\r\nLike the `Calcite?QueryTest` test classes, you can specify expected results when the query is run in a restricted \"test\" execution engine. Such test runs run single process, against in-memory segments, so check query semantics, but they do not test the full server stack nor do they give accurate performance characterizations. Druid has many different run modes (with or without vectorization, SQL-compatible nulls or not, various context variables. The test framework provides tools to work with these variations.\r\n\r\nTests of this sort are quite strict: change anything and the test will fail. This can be painful if you just want to change something and are not concerned about side-effects. It can, however, make changing the planner a breeze because you get extreme visibility into the exact impact your change has: no surprises.\r\n\r\nSee the [`README.md`](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/f010853165adc0ec2d019f3ae95b3b721dfd6f41/sql/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/tester/README.md) file for full details of the case file syntax, how to create a test, and how to convert existing test files.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nThe following shows a test converted from `CalciteQueryTest`, including the various test case sections:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n==============================================================\r\nConverted from testTopNLimitWrapping()\r\n=== case\r\nTop n limit wrapping\r\n=== SQL\r\nSELECT dim1, COUNT(*)\r\nFROM druid.foo\r\nGROUP BY dim1\r\nORDER BY dim1 DESC\r\n=== context\r\nsqlOuterLimit=2\r\n=== schema\r\ndim1 VARCHAR\r\nEXPR$1 BIGINT\r\n=== plan\r\nLogicalSort(sort0=[$0], dir0=[DESC], fetch=[2:BIGINT])\r\n  LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], EXPR$1=[COUNT()])\r\n    LogicalProject(dim1=[$2])\r\n      LogicalTableScan(table=[[druid, foo]])\r\n=== native\r\n{\r\n  \"queryType\" : \"topN\",\r\n  ...\r\n=== results\r\n[\"def\",1]\r\n[\"abc\",1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiple other sections are available: the above is one of the simpler cases.\r\n\r\n## Running Queries\r\n\r\nThe`Calcite?QueryTest` cases verify the native query and results. Verifying results is harder than one would expect: most tests run with two variations (SQL and classic null handling) which produces different results. Others use generators to run up to eight option variations for a total of 16 runs, with differing results. Adding results to the test framework is thus non-trivial and left as a second PR.\r\n\r\nSince the new framework can’t check results, we are left with using both the old and new versions of converted tests. This is unfortunate: a goal for a second PR is to retire the “legacy” test files. A big bonus: someone had to laboriously write the Java code to build up native queries for those tests. In the figure, the computer will do it for us.\r\n\r\n## PR Details\r\n\r\nThis section summarizes the many changes required to create the test framework.\r\n\r\n### Druid Planner State Capture\r\n\r\nPlanners want to be black boxes: query in, plan out. Tests want visibility into the internal states as described above. The planner is modified to allow a `PlannerStateCapture` instance which can record (capture) this internal state. By default, the planner uses a \"no op\" capture. Tests provide a capturing instance.\r\n\r\nThe code to parse SQL was repeated three times. Factored that into a function.\r\n\r\nAdded the ability to capture the internal \"execution plan\" or \"physical plan\" in the `QueryMaker` via a new `explain()` method. This method does everything except send the query to another node for execution. The various query makers are refactored to support the two paths (explain and execute). For a SELECT, the physical plan is just the native plan with a few extra fields sent to the Broker. For INSERT, it is whatever the particular INSERT extension chooses to provide.\r\n\r\n### Union Queries\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, SQL UNION ALL queries have no direct native query representation: they turn into a list of native queries. Since we want to serialize \"the\" native query, the framework creates a \"fake\" \"union\" native query type on the fly to represent unions. Ugly, but it works.\r\n\r\n### INSERT/REPLACE Statements\r\n\r\nThe INSERT and REPLACE support in the planner is a bit of a bolt-on. The planner knows how to work with SELECT statements only, including if they are wrapped in a DESCRIBE or INSERT/REPLACE. When exiting the Calcite logical plan, the INSERT and REPLACE nodes don't appear. The test framework \"invents\" nodes for these cases (in the test framework only) so the the logical plan makes sense.\r\n\r\n### Planner Config\r\n\r\nThe planner config class has grown to be a monster: it holds config not just for the planner, but also for the segment metadata caching layer. This PR resisted the temptation to fix that issue.\r\n\r\nInstead, it fixes another issue: tests want to tinker with the planner config via the \"options\" setting. But, the planner context is opaque: the only way to create one is via JSON serialization. Modified the class to provide a builder for use in tests. \r\n\r\nThe builder is then used in place of the detailed code in the `withOverrides` method.\r\n\r\n### Calcite Test Refactoring\r\n\r\n`ExpressionProcessing` now allows a test to change the expression settings on the fly. This lets the test case declare, via the \"options\" section, how it wants to process expressions, allowing the variations to be tested in a single run.\r\n\r\n`Calcites` has a `escapeStringLiteral()` method which escapes string literals, but is a bit too aggressive and results in a hard-to-read string with all punctuation converted to Unicode escapes. A new method, `escapeStringLiteralLenient()` is added to do the lightest-possible escaping and results in much better output in the test cases.\r\n \r\nThe `BaseCalciteTest` class was refactored a bit to:\r\n\r\n* Use the new `PlannerConfig.Builder` to create the various planner configs rather than anonymous classes.\r\n* Add support for planner state capture while running tests. Does nothing by default; can be turned on to capture planner state when converting tests from Java to the new framework. (This capture is distinct from the existing \"hook\" mechanism to capture the native query while running the query.)\r\n\r\n`RootSchemaBuilder` holds the code to build up Druid's Calcite root schema. It is refactored to a builder so that tests can add to the root schema.\r\n`CalciteTests` is refactored to use the above builder.\r\n\r\n### Druid Planner Test\r\n\r\nThe new `DruidPlannerTest` class, and its associated \".case\" files holds test converted from:\r\n\r\n* `CalciteInsertDmlTest`\r\n* `CalciteArrayQueriesTest`\r\n* `CalciteCorrelatedQueryTest`\r\n* `CalciteMultiValueStringQueryTest`\r\n* `CalciteParameterQueryTest`\r\n\r\nThis isn't all such tests, just enough to allow a particular project to proceed with confidence. More conversions can be done later. And, as noted, the test file does not currently run the queries: it only plans them and verifies the artifacts.\r\n\r\nThe other classes in `sql/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/tester/` support the test framework:\r\n\r\n* `README.md` contains instructions for using the test framework.\r\n* `internals.md` provides details, such as a reference for the test case file format.\r\n* `PlannerFixture` is a kitchen-sink class that encapsulates the code to set up a planner (and all its associated knick-knacks) to run a test. Other tests could use this class rather than doing the setup themselves, but that conversion is not done in this PR.\r\n* `QueryTestCase` represents one planner test case and its sections.\r\n* `ActualResults` records the actual results of a run, compares them with the expected results, and writes a report if there are errors.\r\n* `TestCaseLoader` simple parser for the test case file format.\r\n* Other classes are lower-level helpers.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-19T18:29:03Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T16:53:25Z","closed_at":"2022-06-27T16:53:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6666d86cf178e747560ea1db1d21cea81af2f9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\nFollow up to #11634, this PR fixes a regression when matching some prefixes, which in cases like`ip_match('192.168.1.250', '192.168.1.251/31')` was now evaluating to false. The solution is to use `prefixContains` (when matching strings) instead of `contains`. Added tests to ensure that this behaves as it did previously and this evaluates to true. I've also modified long matching to instead of converting every long row from an `IPv4Address` to an `IPAddressString`, to instead use `toPrefixBlock` and `contains` on the block, which seems ~4x faster (see benchmarks in the comment, `longContainsUsingIpAddr` is using the new approach while `longContainsUsingIpAddrWithStrings` is the old).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-19T06:20:00Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:11:35Z","closed_at":"2022-06-01T21:03:09Z","merged_at":"2022-06-01T21:03:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"98f6bca2cda31762a9f259334f7eea384aac0477","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nPosting an early and rough draft of the work I've started a few weeks back, given that https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12404 was also opened recently and was just brought to my attention. The PR here and https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12404 share similar goals regarding the optimization of queries on the tasks endpoints. \r\n\r\nThe approach I follow is a bit different, after I evaluated tradeoffs between adding new columns for specific subfields (as https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12404 proposes) as well as writing queries that would deserialize the payload on the fly and this approach. \r\n\r\nIn this PR the suggestion is to keep querying the payload columns, but select specific subfields after we effectively change the type of the columns to be JSONB instead of BYTEA. This change is currently applicable to the Postgres backend with a port to MySQL to be potentially possible as well, while support for the non-production backend of Derby doesn't seem straightforward at the moment (this partly explains why this PR lacks tests at the moment and for this reason is not ready for a full review). The PR also adds a query parameter to two task endpoints in order to get the specific fields required by the web console. \r\n\r\nRegarding the tradeoffs of this approach, here's a quick list of things I can think of: \r\n\r\nPROS: \r\n* We don't commit to the addition of extra columns that would require schema evolution in the future. They new payload columns should replace the old ones.\r\n* Based on some basic experiments with roughly 80K tasks the storage was moderately increased (less than 20%) which might not be significant for this metadata table. \r\n* Querying the new columns to extract the json subfields is comparable to the current query execution times. \r\n\r\nCONS: \r\n* The fields that we are interested in are not elevated as first class columns and are kept embedded in the JSON payloads. \r\n* Storage and query times might still be slightly higher than adding the specific fields as individual columns. \r\n\r\nThis PR is currently lacking code to migrate task history and tests. This is something I would add if we think this could be plausible approach. Also any new names are not necessarily final or well thought out suggestions.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR is based off of the 0.22.1 branch but will rebase on top of `master` if any of the changes here are valuable. \r\n\r\nAlso, please note that this is my first contribution to the Druid project and this PR probably reflects this fact in various ways. \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate some high level comments on the direction of this early draft and whether we think that it's an approach that we could follow or combine with the one proposed in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12404. \r\n\r\ncc @imply-cheddar @AmatyaAvadhanula @xvrl \r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes `Cannot serialize BigInt value as JSON` error while loading compaction config in console.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Numbers over `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (9,007,199,254,740,991) may not be handled by few clients like JS.\r\n\r\nHence reducing the default `inputSegmentSizeBytes` from `Long.MAX_VALUE` to 100,000,000,000,000 (~100TB).\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

In nonvectorized processing, SingleLongInputCachingExpressionColumnValueSelector implements an optimization to avoid computing the time_floor function on every row. There is no such optimization in vectorized processing.\r\n\r\nIMO, we shouldn't mention this in the docs. Rationale: It's too fiddly of a thing: it's not guaranteed that nonvectorized processing will be faster due to the optimization, because it would have to overcome the inherent speed advantage of vectorization. So it'd always require testing to determine the best setting for a specific dataset. It would be bad if users disabled vectorization thinking it would speed up their queries, and it actually slowed them down. And even if users do their own testing, at some point in the future we'll implement the optimization for vectorized processing too, and it's likely that users that explicitly disabled vectorization will continue to have it disabled. I'd like to avoid this outcome by encouraging all users to enable vectorization at all times. Really advanced users would be following development activity anyway, and can read this issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nAdd cluster by support for replace syntax.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

tests had problems where a direct ByteBuffer would be allocated\r\nand then not freed. This is bad because it causes flaky tests.\r\n\r\nTo fix this:\r\n\r\n1) Add ByteBufferUtils.allocateDirect(size), which returns a ResourceHolder.\r\n   This makes it easy to free the direct buffer. Currently, it's only used\r\n   in tests, because production code seems OK.\r\n\r\n2) Update all usages of ByteBuffer.allocateDirect (off-heap) in tests either\r\n   to ByteBuffer.allocate (on-heap, which are garbaged collected), or to\r\n   ByteBufferUtils.allocateDirect (wherever it seemed like there was a good\r\n   reason for the buffer to be off-heap). Make sure to close all direct\r\n   holders when done.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes three other issues that came up while debugging flaky tests:\r\n\r\n1) Various places in the tests altered the global NullHandlingConfig but did not\r\n    reset it. Now, they do properly reset it.\r\n\r\n2) ExpressionLambdaAggregatorFactory's getComparator, combine, and\r\n    finalizeComputation methods were not thread-safe. AggregatorFactory\r\n    instances are shared across threads at various points, so they do need\r\n    to be thread-safe. Now, they're made thread-safe by moving bindings\r\n    from Suppliers to ThreadLocals.\r\n\r\n3) ExpressionLambdaBufferAggregator's get method would sometimes retain a\r\n    reference to the underlying buffer, which isn't allowed per contract of\r\n    BufferAggregator. Now, it's copied when necessary.","created_at":"2022-05-15T01:12:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:12:12Z","closed_at":"2022-05-19T14:42:29Z","merged_at":"2022-05-19T14:42:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"4631cff2a9b8cdf5850e39e7d889d951a895a468","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area - Testing","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

the majority of cases, this improves performance.\r\n\r\nThere's only one case I'm aware of where this may be a net negative: for `time_floor(__time, <period>)` where there are many repeated `__time` values. In nonvectorized processing, SingleLongInputCachingExpressionColumnValueSelector implements an optimization to avoid computing the `time_floor` function on every row. There is no such optimization in vectorized processing.\r\n\r\nIMO, we shouldn't mention this in the docs. Rationale: It's too fiddly of a thing: it's not guaranteed that nonvectorized processing will be faster due to the optimization, because it would have to overcome the inherent speed advantage of vectorization. So it'd always require testing to determine the best setting for a specific dataset. It would be bad if users disabled vectorization thinking it would speed up their queries, and it actually slowed them down. And even if users do their own testing, at some point in the future we'll implement the optimization for vectorized processing too, and it's likely that users that explicitly disabled vectorization will continue to have it disabled. I'd like to avoid this outcome by encouraging all users to enable vectorization at all times. Really advanced users would be following development activity anyway, and can read this issue

related:\r\n\r\n1) InDimFilter: Store stored Strings (in ValuesSet) plus sorted UTF-8\r\n   ByteBuffers (in valuesUtf8). Use valuesUtf8 whenever possible. If\r\n   necessary, the input set is copied into a ValuesSet. Much logic is\r\n   simplified, because we always know what type the values set will be.\r\n   I think that there won't even be an efficiency loss in most cases.\r\n   InDimFilter is most frequently created by deserialization, and this\r\n   patch updates the JsonCreator constructor to deserialize\r\n   directly into a ValuesSet.\r\n\r\n2) Add Utf8ValueSetIndex, which InDimFilter uses to avoid UTF-8 decodes\r\n   during index lookups.\r\n\r\n3) Add unsigned comparator to ByteBufferUtils and use it in\r\n   GenericIndexed.BYTE_BUFFER_STRATEGY. This is important because UTF-8\r\n   bytes can be compared as bytes if, and only if, the comparison\r\n   is unsigned.\r\n\r\n4) Add specialization to GenericIndexed.singleThreaded().indexOf that\r\n   avoids needless ByteBuffer allocations.\r\n\r\n5) Clarify that objects returned by ColumnIndexSupplier.as are not\r\n   thread-safe. DictionaryEncodedStringIndexSupplier now calls\r\n   singleThreaded() on all relevant GenericIndexed objects, saving\r\n   a ByteBuffer allocation per access.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n1) Fix performance regression in LikeFilter: since #12315, it applied\r\n   the suffix matcher to all values in range even for type MATCH_ALL.\r\n\r\n2) Add ObjectStrategy.canCompare() method. This fixes LikeFilterBenchmark,\r\n   which was broken due to calls to strategy.compare in\r\n   GenericIndexed.fromIterable.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks:\r\n\r\nImprovements to \"in\" filters (due to using UTF-8 comparisons) and \"like\" filters (due to fixing a perf regression).\r\n\r\n**patch**\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                         (dictionarySize)  (filterSize)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nInFilterBenchmark.doFilter                 1000000         10000  avgt   10  3522.824 ± 35.642  us/op\r\n\r\nBenchmark                            (cardinality)                Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nLikeFilterBenchmark.matchLikePrefix        1000000                avgt   10   660.164 ± 19.946  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n**9177515be224269dc0299eae809591cb373d83a0 (master)**\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                         (dictionarySize)  (filterSize)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nInFilterBenchmark.doFilter                 1000000         10000  avgt   10  6723.385 ± 59.267  us/op\r\n\r\nBenchmark                            (cardinality)                Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nLikeFilterBenchmark.matchLikePrefix        1000000                avgt   10  1348.478 ± 12.959  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n**deb69d1bc03aef784a563260bed1d21505495439 (before #12388)**\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                         (dictionarySize)  (filterSize)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nInFilterBenchmark.doFilter                 1000000         10000  avgt   10  6803.080 ± 87.903  us/op\r\n\r\nBenchmark                            (cardinality)                Mode  Cnt     Score   Error  Units\r\nLikeFilterBenchmark.matchLikePrefix        1000000                avgt   10   717.091 ± 3.451  us/op\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-13T02:03:13Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:12:03Z","closed_at":"2022-05-20T08:51:28Z","merged_at":"2022-05-20T08:51:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"69aac6c8dd5588ed19f0cf90f11025317133df57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

change: add a `mergeThreadLocal` option. Normally, the ConcurrentGrouper shares merge buffers across processing threads until spilling starts, and then switches to a thread-local model. This minimizes memory use and reduces likelihood of spilling, which is good, but it creates thread contention. The new mergeThreadLocal option causes a query to start in thread-local mode immediately, and allows us to experiment with the relative performance of the two modes.\r\n\r\nSecond change: fix a race condition as part of the switch from hash-based to thread-local buffer selection: it's possible that thread A is still aggregating into grouper B (selected via hash) while thread B is simultaneously trying to aggregate into it (selected via thread-locality). The fix is to always synchronize on the grouper, regardless of how it was selected. I expect that this fix will be fine performance-wise, since contention will be nil once things switch over to thread-local selection.","created_at":"2022-05-12T18:46:18Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:11:56Z","closed_at":"2022-05-21T17:28:54Z","merged_at":"2022-05-21T17:28:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"37853f8de4ba801a5f6c429ccceeb58b58762109","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #12398 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThe test case [ testIsTaskCurrent ](https://github.com/apache/druid/tree/master/extensions-core/kinesis-indexing-service/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/kinesis/supervisor/KinesisSupervisorTest.java#L3885) is testing the `supervisor.isTaskCurrent()` with 4 different scenarios (`taskFromStorage`, `taskFromStorageMismatchedDataSchema`,`taskFromStorageMismatchedTuningConfig`,`taskFromStorageMismatchedPartitionsWithTaskGroup`) in one single test case. In my humble opinion, it could be beneficial to separate the four scenarios into four individual test cases. Each test case will focus on one scenario. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nSo in this PR, based on the discussion in #12398 , the [ `testIsTaskCurrent()` ](https://github.com/apache/druid/tree/master/extensions-core/kinesis-indexing-service/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/kinesis/supervisor/KinesisSupervisorTest.java#L3885) is replaced by four unit tests `testIsTaskCurrentTaskFromStorage()`, `testIsTaskCurrentTaskFromStorageMismatchedDataSchema()`, `testIsTaskCurrentTaskFromStorageMismatchedTuningConfig()`, `testIsTaskCurrentTaskFromStorageMismatchedPartitionsWithTaskGroup()`, and one setup function `isCurrentSetup()`.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added class in this PR\r\n * `KinesisSupervisorTest`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nImproves coordinator load rule logging to include current replication levels, and adds missing segment id and tier information from some of the log messages. I've seen some strange behavior where segments become very over-replicated, particularly when multiple tiers are involved, but sometimes even when not, and am hoping these logging improvements can help track down the issue.\r\n\r\nThese logs should will print replication for all tiers, as well as consistently provide segment id and tier information:\r\n```\r\n2022-05-11T10:26:26,009 WARN [Coordinator-Exec--0] org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.rules.LoadRule - No available [_default_tier] servers or node capacity to assign segment [wikipedia_hour_2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z_2016-06-27T01:00:00.000Z_2022-02-18T23:27:41.739Z]!

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Added a new coordinator dynamic configuration item\r\n\r\n~`maxSegmentsToLoad`~ `maxSegmentsToLoadPerCoordinationCycle`\r\n \r\n> This it the maximum number of segments - both primary and non-primary replicants - that can\r\n        be loaded per Coordination run. The default is equivalent to there being no limit. This\r\n        differs from maxNonPrimaryReplicantsToLoad because it includes the count of primary\r\n        replicants that are loaded in the limit. An operator may want to use this configuration to\r\n        prevent the coordinator from spinning and loading many segments that are already loaded, but\r\n        appeared to be unavailable due to a temporary network issue causing some number of Historical\r\n        servers to have their segments go missing (or some other event that caused a similar event).\r\n\r\n#### Added logic in RunRules to short-circuit if the number of segments loaded reaches the value of the new dynamic config\r\n\r\nWe track the aggregate number of segments loaded during the execution of RunRules in a global statistic. `LoadRule.java` is the class that updates this stat as it loads segments. `RunRules.java` is continuously checking the value of this stat, making sure we haven't loaded the max amount of segments before it matches another segment to load rules. If the limit is reached, RunRules won't address any more segments and the coordinator moves on to the next duty.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Why?\r\n\r\nThe coordinator refreshes its map of the segments loaded in the cluster at the start of the list of duties it is about to execute. It does not dynamically respond to segments being announced while the duties are in-flight. This means that if for some reason 10% of druid segments were unavailable at the start of coordination, but became available while the coordinator was executing run rules, the coordinator would still proceed with loading all of the segments who were unavailable or under-replicated. This can lead to lots of wasted time and work! If those 10% of unavailable segments take 20 minutes to load, that is 20 minutes that the coordinator could have been doing other work, such as loading actual unavailable segments that were newly ingested, etc.\r\n\r\nAn example when something like this could happen is if you had a network issue that temporarily forced a number of historical nodes offline, but they re-connected shortly thereafter, but too late to prevent the coordinator from thinking all of their data was gone. \r\n\r\nAnother example would be some type of negative event where multiple historical servers had to be restarted. Think OOM or GC issues due to an unusual workload. If those historicals restart after the coordinator has decided they were not serving their segments anymore, we end up trying to load all the segments despite them announcing after starting up.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day this is a niche configuration that operators may desire access to in some circumstances. I come from a background of operating a large multi-tenant cluster wrote this patch out of necessity due to an existing issue we are having. Our cluster has faced some instability recently due to unexpected workloads causing historicals to wedge in a sub optimal state due to GC. While we work on a solution to the underlying problem, this a mitigating resource to deal with the occasions that we have to restart multiple historical servers at one time to get out of the bad state. I configure the coordinator to load only as many segments as we typically see during peak ingest times. That way, we are operating as normal at all times, and in the case of an unexpected issue, the coordinator will not load thousands of segments that come back online after historical restarts.\r\n\r\n#### How is this different from `maxNonPrimaryReplicantsToLoad`\r\n\r\nThis dynamic configuration was also introduced by me. Again, a reaction to an experience while managing a large cluster. When we took servers out for maintenance, we did not want the coordinator block while replicating all of the segments to get back to full replication. Instead we wanted the coordinator to eat away at finite sized chunks of replicas. This was to prevent blocking other duties from running, such as loading primary replicas.\r\n\r\nThat configuration still serves that purpose if it is set lower than this new configuration. For instance, I may want to limit my coordinator to loading a max of 10000 segments per RunRules cycle. However, I also want to limit non-primary replicas to 4000. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `RunRules`\r\n * `LoadRule`\r\n * web-console dynamic config forms\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
