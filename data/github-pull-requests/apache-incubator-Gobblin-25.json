A bug was introduced into GoogleWebmasterExtractor due to the commit 76ae45a by ibuenros on 12/20/16 at 11:34AM Query based source will reset to low watermark if previous run did not process any data for that table.\r\n\r\nThat commit is requiring \"meaningful\" implementation of getExpectedRecordCount for the extractors. So there is a change there.\r\n\r\n2. Deprecate the usage of GoogleWebMasterSourceWeekly.\r\n\r\n3. Fixed the bug of ActualHighWatermark Settings. Current implementation will cause a bug every 24 days because of using Hour-type Watermark with an interval of 23 hours.

@ibuenros \r\n\r\nSorry this is so long - wanted to implement the concepts in a few places to make sure the abstractions didn't immediately break down, but that ends up with there being a lot of lines changed.\r\n\r\n 2 main pieces in this commit:\r\n\r\n- Support of capability checking and verification. Two design goals here:\r\n  - If a job is configured with encryption and the writer doesn't support it, we must blow up\r\n  - There a bunch of cases where we want to query objects for their capability. Annotations aren't necessarily sufficient enough because there may be other pieces of config attached - eg encryption with AES vs something else. Methods seem the right way to go. \r\n - Wrap StreamEncoders around FileStreamBasedWriters, FsDataWriterBuilders, and KafkaWriters to support encryption. SimpleEncryptor is a proof of concept.\r\n\r\nOther details:\r\n\r\n- Since only Writers support capability checks right now, the Fork is responsible for verifying that the writer can be properly built. I could eventually see this being refactored out into a broader object that can validate all objects in the config. (Eg catch errors where a Writer expects a GenericRecord type but will always be passed a String because of the converter chain)\r\n- WriterBuilders are asked if they know how to build a writer with the correct capability. Right now that information tends to be hardcoded in the builders, but you could see this eventually going one level further and having builders query info on the writers they know about. Not implemented here because it would add more complexity, and all builders only instantiate 1 type of writer right now anyways\r\n- Refactor the FsWriters a little bit and introduce a FsStreamBasedWriter middle class - the Hive Output format writer uses Hadoop OutputFormat and RecordWriters so cannot support encryption without additional work\r\n- Adding encryption to the Kafka writers means Gobblin serializes the incoming record to byte[] itself; it will manually call the ValueSerializer specified in the kafka-writer config vs letting Kafka do it for us.","created_at":"2017-02-07T21:47:34Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T18:44:04Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1607/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1607/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1607/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/441b4bda164d4d395bdb6f7245fbfa712bf0076b","head":{"label":"eogren:encryption_poc","ref":"encryption_poc","sha":"441b4bda164d4d395bdb6f7245fbfa712bf0076b","user":{"login":"eogren","id":5913279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTMyNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5913279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren","html_url":"https://github.com/eogren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80959829,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDk1OTgyOQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"eogren/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eogren","id":5913279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTMyNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5913279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren","html_url":"https://github.com/eogren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eogren/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

as it exists today is a framework that can be used to build different integration applications like ingest, replication etc. Each of these applications are typically configured as a separate job and executed through a scheduler like Azkaban. This PR introduces an approach to evolve Gobblin from a framework to a service. Specifically, the goal of this PR is to enable self service so that different users or external services can programmatically provision and execute all supported Gobblin applications limiting the need for the development and manual deployment during the provisioning process across multiple Gobblin Deployments. \r\n\r\n# Gobblin as a Service (GAAS) overall Architecture\r\n\r\n![diagram-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69499/23245116/18549136-f93f-11e6-93ed-e4de317b179c.png)\r\n\r\nThe figure above provides a high level architectural view of Gobblin as a Service. \r\nIn the diagram above, each of the solid lines represents a unique Gobblin Job. The dotted lines are control flow messages.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, Gobblin as a Service exposes an API (and in future an UI) for users to submit requests. These requests are then translated into well defined Gobblin jobs. The users would principally interact with Gobblin as a Service through the Orchestration Service. We discuss the details of this module below.\r\n\r\n## Service Cluster (Frontend / Backend)\r\n\r\n![diagram-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69499/23245142/3abee294-f93f-11e6-9eda-0e6099749099.png)\r\n\r\nGaaS itself runs in a cluster mode for high availability. This cluster consists of identical nodes backed by a VIP for load balancing. Each node in the cluster hosts a frontend server and a backend server. \r\n- **FE servers (not in this PR):** FE or Frontend servers exposes a User Interface to let users manage their requests. It interacts with the  Backend servers via the REST APIs. \r\n- **BE servers:** BE or Backend servers are the core of the system and have several sub modules. These servers are the actual orchestrators of the user desired data flow.  All nodes in the cluster are identical. However, only one of them performs monitoring to avoid duplication of work. This node is designated as the master node and its election is done using Helix/Zookeeper.  The BE servers communicates with different Gobblin Jobs using any communication paradigm supported by that particular Gobblin Job. At the very minimum, Kafka messages are supported.\r\n\r\nThe important sub-components of Backend server are discussed in “Service Core Architecture” design section.\r\n\r\n**Modes (Standalone single instance / cluster)** \r\n\r\nGaaS can be run and deployed in multiple modes. The dependencies for each are listed as follows: \r\n- **Single instance mode:** FE and BE deployed on same box, no requirement of Zookeeper \r\n- **Cluster mode:** FE and BE deployed on multiple boxes, Zookeeper required for master election for monitoring in BE server. \r\n\r\n## Service Core Architecture (modules running on each machine)\r\n\r\n![diagram-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69499/23245154/4d1ad22c-f93f-11e6-8d3d-c47163c493e2.png)\r\n\r\nAs described in the previous section, each node / machine in the cluster runs identical subcomponents. In this section, we will zoom into the modules that Backend server on each machine runs. \r\n\r\nBefore we discuss individual sub-components and their design, let us define a few terms for easier understanding of the design.  \r\n\r\n**General terms:**  \r\n- **Logical Data Flow:** Representative of the required flow of dataset from source to specific destination(s) that can take the form: “Ingest Salesforce data to NoSQL and then load the data onto HDFS” \r\n- **Gobblin Jobs:** Representative of physical flow ie. job in that Gobblin understands of the form of Pair <Job Executor Instance, Job Specification <Job Config, Job Template>> that ingests, manipulates and moves data. For eg., a DistcpNg job executing on Grid-1 that copies data between Grid-1 and Grid-2 are an example of Gobblin jobs.\r\n\r\n**Logical Entities:**  \r\n- **FlowSpec:** Data model representation that describes a Logical Data Flow.  \r\n- **JobSpec:** Data model representation that describes a physical Gobblin Job.   \r\n- **TopologySpec:** Data model representation that describes a topology ie. a JobExecutorInstance and its capabilities tuple (JobExecutorInstance is described later)\r\n- **GobblinMetricsEvents:** Standard events that gobblin-metric emits to help track various execution events and metrics. \r\n- **Job Templates:** Pre-configured file with properties that can be overridden for various possible physical Gobblin Jobs. \r\n- **Template Packs:** Independently deployed template collection that contains Gobblin Job Templates. \r\n\r\n**Key components and their working:**  \r\n- **JobExecutorInstance:** A technology and location tuple representative of a data pipeline or system that can process physical Gobblin Jobs. Examples are:  <Azkaban-1, Grid-1>, <Gobblin SelfManaged Cluster, Grid-2>\r\n- **JobExecutorInstance Capabilities:** List of tuple of JobExecutorInstance and its Capability. Capability is the tuple of source and list of destination(s) that a JobExecutorInstance supports. \r\nGobblinClusterJobExecutorInstance: A Gobblin SelfManaged Cluster’s JobExecutorInstance. \r\nAzkabanJobExecutorInstance: An Azkaban JobExecutorInstance. \r\n- **FlowManager:**  A sub-component of Gobblin-as-a-Service that runs as a JVM Service in BE and hosts FlowCatalog and FlowCompiler. \r\n- **FlowCatalog:** A catalog of all the FlowSpecs that are currently known to Gobblin-as-a-Service. \r\n- **FlowCatalogListener:** A hook to listen to any FlowSpec changes such as addition, deletion or update of any FlowSpec. \r\n- **FlowStore:** A persistence layer where FlowSpecs are persisted for durability. \r\n- **FlowCompiler:** A logical module that takes in a FlowSpec and converts it into JobSpecs that are runnable on specific JobExecutorInstance. \r\n- **TopologyManager:** A sub-component of Gobblin-as-a-Service that runs as a JVM Service in BE and hosts TopologyCatalog.\r\n- **TopologyCatalog:** A catalog of all the TopologySpecs that are currently known to Gobblin-as-a-Service.\r\n- **TopologyCatalogListener:** A hook to listen to any TopologySpec changes such as addition, deletion or update of any TopologySpec. \r\n- **OrchestratorModule:** A sub-component of Gobblin-as-a-Service that runs as a JVM Service in BE and is a FlowCatalogListener and TopologyCatalogListener. If any FlowSpec is added, removed or updated or any TopologySpec is added, removed or updated then the OrchestratorModule invokes FlowCompiler to determine updated JobSpecs for a FlowSpec and provisions them on respective JobExecutorInstances.\r\n- **JobCompiler:** A logical module that takes in a JobSpec and creates customized jobs that can be understood by respective JobExecutorInstance such as GobblinClusterJobExecutorInstance and AzkabanJobExecutorInstance.  \r\n- **Monitoring Module:** A sub-component of Gobblin-as-a-Service that runs as a JVM Service in BE and tracks completion of FlowSpec and related metrics and SLAs. \r\n- **MetricsConsumers:** A logical module used by Monitoring to consume metrics from various sources such as Kafka. (We generally emit GobblinMetricsEvents to Kafka from all JobExecutorInstance)\r\n- **MetricAnalyzer:** A logical module used by Monitoring to analyze consumed metrics and aggregate them by FlowSpec. \r\n- **SLAMonitor:** A logical module used by Monitoring to use the analysis performed by MetricAnalyzer to ensure against SLA violations.\r\n- **MetricsStore:** A persistence layer where metrics are persisted for durability. \r\n- **CoreServices:** A sub-component of Gobblin-as-a-Service that is the application entry point for BE and starts other sub-components as JVM Services. \r\n- **Provisioner:** A futuristic sub-component of Gobblin-as-a-Service that will run as a JVM Service and provision ie. launch and setup JobExecutorInstances if required. \r\n- **JobMonitor:** A component that is a part of JobExecutorInstance that listens for any new or updated JobSpec being shipped by the Orchestrator module in Gobblin-as-a-Service. \r\n- **KafkaJobMonitor:** A Kafka JobMonitor that listens to Kafka for any new or updated JobSpecs.

This schema mismatch causes the exception.\r\n\r\nSolution: \r\nWhen we assume that schema changes in the dataset are backward compatible, we can always use the most recent schema (taken from the schema registry) as a reader schema during deserialization.\r\nConfluent's Schema registry 2.0.1 doesn't support reader schemas (see `io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroDeserializer`), this has been added to 3.0.1 however, `KafkaDeserializerExtractor#decodeRecord` always calls the default deserializer method without passing the reader schema.\r\n\r\nTo support reader schemas regardless of the _confluentVersion_ being used, I subclassed \r\n`KafkaAvroDeserializer` and ported the relevant codes from the Confluent implementation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the tests with different Schema Registry versions this works fine, however I'm not quite sure  whether there exists a simpler solution which doesn't require codes ported from 3rd party dependencies.","created_at":"2017-01-27T22:08:10Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T09:59:14Z","closed_at":"2017-03-06T09:57:08Z","merged_at":"2017-03-06T09:57:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"22eb7468181cfefc90442779adf7cab1cda48a10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8d20ca5acd86102cfdedd5922ebc67fcb2631b66","head":{"label":"lbendig:lbendig_schema_read_fix","ref":"lbendig_schema_read_fix","sha":"8d20ca5acd86102cfdedd5922ebc67fcb2631b66","user":{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":31592005,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU5MjAwNQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"lbendig/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbe

Removed compile dependencies on gobblin-admin -- the main challenge was the use of the ADMIN_SERVER_ENABLED_KEY flag rather than dependency injection through config. I had to do the latter but adding a factory interface to gobblin-api and adding ADMIN_SERVER_FACTORY_CLASS_KEY . Eventually, I think the whole implementation has to refactored into a GobblinInstancePlugin that can be specified when the instance is configured.\r\n- Made gobblin-admin as part of the \"full\"
