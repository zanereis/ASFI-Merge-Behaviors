patch improves the validation of parameters to aliases for countDistinct() and countDistinctApprox(). The aliases have also been renamed for consistency with other builtin functions:\r\n\r\n- countDistinctRow() -> rowCountDistinct()\r\n- countDistinctCol() -> colCountDistinct()\r\n- countDistinctApproxRow() -> rowCountDistinctApprox()\r\n- countDistinctApproxCol() -> colCountDistinctApprox()\r\n\r\ncountDistinctApproxRow() and countDistinctApproxCol() only accept a single additional parameter for type (default=KMV), which is optional. countDistinctRow() and countDistinctCol() have been converted from parameterized builtin functions to non-parameterized builtins as the aliases specify their respective directions implicitly.","created_at":"2022-11-06T02:31:39Z","updated_at":"2022-12-10T01:09:24Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T15:10:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6c2a78d3dc114eacd11deede58de27d9bb4a7f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/e6d7055c293af34972c1d926f9daa5e71490b3d4","head":{"label":"BACtaki:builtins/countDistinct/bugfix","ref":"builtins/countDistinct/bugfix","sha":"e6d7055c293af34972c1d926f9daa5e71490b3d4","user":{"login":"BACtaki","id":7691755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTE3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7691755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki","html_url":"https://github.com/BACtaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":382721844,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODI3MjE4NDQ=","name":"systemds","full_name":"BACtaki/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BACtaki","id":7691755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTE3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7691755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki","html_url":"https://github.com/BACtaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BACtaki/systemds","description":"Apache

PR contains code for adding a new lib function to allow comparing matrices for equivalence.\r\nThe functionality is going to be used in compression to compare dictionaries, but i thought the best way forward was to add it as a proper structure.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to compare matrices and return false if any cells in the \"semantic\" version of the matrix block differ, meaning that for instance a sparse matrix can be compared to a dense and return true if the \"semantic\" of the matrices are the same, otherwise false.\r\n\r\nThe PR is not containing code to cover Compressed Matrices, and with the initial commit only contain code for the interface and throws a NotImplementedException.","created_at":"2022-10-26T12:13:45Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T22:44:19Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T14:52:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bba2944251a6f28f8dd098c98a6ab12a9a8c2479","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1712/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1712/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1712/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/6aa350289272e11b1ae3893a18cce4e6acebeab5","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:equalOnMatrixBlock","ref":"equalOnMatrixBlock","sha":"6aa350289272e11b1ae3893a18cce4e6acebeab5","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging.

[actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) from 2 to 3.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases\">actions/setup-node's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Add support for asdf format and update actions/cache version to 3.0.0</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/526\">caching error handling</a>. Moreover, we added support for asdf format as Node.js version file <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/373\">actions/setup-node#373</a>. Besides, we introduced new output <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/534\">node-version</a> and added <code>npm-shrinkwrap.json</code> to dependency file patterns: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/439\">actions/setup-node#439</a></p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 2.0.2</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes related to GHES 3.5 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/460\">actions/setup-node#460</a>)</p>\n<h2>v3.0.0</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we changed version of the runtime Node.js for the setup-node action and updated package-lock.json file to  v2.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the update to Node 16 in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/414\">actions/setup-node#414</a>, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.</li>\n<li>We removed deprecated <code>version</code> input (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/424\">actions/setup-node#424</a>). Please use <code>node-version</code> input instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fix logic of error handling for npm warning and uncaught exception</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we fix logic of error handling related to caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/358\">actions/setup-node#358</a>) and (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/359\">actions/setup-node#359</a>).</p>\n<p>In the previous behaviour we relied on <code>stderr</code> output to throw error. The warning messages from package managers can be written to the stderr's output. For now the action will throw an error only if exit code differs from zero. Besides, we add logic to сatch and log unhandled exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <code>node-version-file</code> input and update <code>actions/cache</code> dependency to the latest version.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>The new input (<code>node-version-file</code>) provides functionality to specify the path to the file containing Node.js's version with such behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the file does not exist the action will throw an error.</li>\n<li>If you specify both <code>node-version</code> and <code>node-version-file</code> inputs, the action will use value from the <code>node-version</code> input and throw the following warning: <code>Both node-version and node-version-file inputs are specified, only node-version will be used</code>.</li>\n<li>For now the action does not support all of the variety of values for Node.js version files. The action can handle values according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node#supported-version-syntax\">documentation</a> and values with <code>v</code> prefix (<code>v14</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - name: Setup node from node version file\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n    with:\n      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'\n  - run: npm install\n  - run: npm test\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Update actions/cache dependency to 1.0.8 version.</h2>\n<p>We updated actions/cache dependency to the latest version (1.0.8). For more information please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md\">toolkit/cache</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add &quot;cache-hit&quot; output</h2>\n<p>This release introduces a new output: <code>cache-hit</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/327\">#327</a>).</p>\n<p>The <code>cache-hit</code> output contains boolean value indicating that an exact match was found for the key. It shows that the action uses already existing cache or not. The output is available only if cache is enabled.</p>\n<h2>Support caching for mono repos and repositories with complex structure</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/305\">#305</a>).</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (<code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code>) in the repository root. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories.

This PR is for supporting both of them.\r\nAn outline of the PR is:\r\n\r\nIt supports Matrix and Frame\r\nIt supports nested and flat datasets\r\nIt supports non-standard datasets, i.e., an

PR replaces the complete clear of the federated lookup table by removing only the entry of the corresponding coordinator which sent the respective _CLEAR_ request.\r\nAdditionally, this PR changes the _FederatedStatistics.coordinatorsTrafficBytes_ list to a CopyOnWriteArrayList in order to avoid the _ConcurrentModificationException_ in a multi-tenant scenario, and modifies the execution of federated requests of the _IndexingFEDInstruction_ in the correct order to broadcast the scalar object before calling the instruction.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMDS-3390\r\n\r\nThis patch improves the performance of `countDistinctApprox()` row/col aggregation by replacing matrix slicing with direct ops on the input matrix. This has the most impact in local CP execution mode, as some simple experiments show:\r\n\r\n(numbers represent average over 3 runs)\r\n1. row aggregation\r\n    (A) dense: 10000x1000 with sparsity=0.9\r\n    1.198s with slicing, 0.874s without slicing - a 27% improvement\r\n\r\n    (B) sparse: 10000x1000 with sparsity=0.1\r\n    0.528s with slicing, 0.512s without slicing - a 3% improvement\r\n\r\nAs expected, the larger and the more dense the input matrix, the larger the performance improvement.\r\n\r\n2. col aggregation\r\n    (A) dense: 1000x10000 with sparsity=0.9\r\n    1.186s with slicing, 1.036s without slicing - a 13% improvement\r\n\r\n    (B) sparse: 1000x10000 with sparsity=0.1\r\n    1.272s with slicing, 0.647s without slicing - a 49% improvement\r\n\r\nIn this case, the sparser the input matrix, the larger the performance improvement. This phenomenon is a result of employing a hash map M in the implementation: as the RxC input matrix becomes denser, M's keyset size approaches C, and the performance approaches the baseline, which uses slicing.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-03T19:16:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T20:54:11Z","closed_at":"2022-08-03T14:53:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb09516cea1cd6ee8f0a1b34d6c3ca6a0ef6082a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1650/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1650/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1650/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/1b6b4037d07fc72de9d96d85a00c7ce4f21f665e","head":{"label":"BACtaki:3390","ref":"3390","sha":"1b6b4037d07fc72de9d96d85a00c7ce4f21f665e","user":{"login":"BACtaki","id":7691755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTE3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7691755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki","html_url":"https://github.com/BACtaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":382721844,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODI3MjE4NDQ=","name":"systemds","full_name":"BACtaki/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BACtaki","id":7691755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTE3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7691755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki","html_url":"https://github.com/BACtaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BACtaki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BACtaki/systemds","description":"Apache

PR changes the local variable map back to a _ConcurrentHashMap_ in order to allow for simultaneously modification and iteration of the map.\r\nWithout a _ConcurrentHashMap_, some algorithms might throw a _ConcurrentModificationException_ because the coordinator does not wait for the worker's result and triggers a new federated instruction in the meanwhile. Therefore, the worker iterates the local variable map when performing an '_rmvar_' instruction, and creates new entries in the local variable map at the same time, resulting in a _ConcurrentModificationException_. Thanks to @kev-inn for finding this issue.\r\nAnother approach to resolve this problem would be to create a queue of federated requests for every coordinator+threadid pair and process the requests of the queue sequentially.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

`DoubleVector` replacement for matrix multiply\r\nJDK 17 adds `Vector` classes to use SIMD instructions. This PR replaces the basic dense dense matrix multiply with an equivalent `DoubleVector` implementation. It is necessary to use JDK 17, therefore we should not merge this yet, but keep it in staging for future reference.\r\n\r\nAs an experiment we check a simple matrix multiply:\r\n`Z = X %*% Y`, $X\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}, Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\times m}$\r\n\r\nThe experiment script performs 10 matrix multiplications and saves the time of the last 5 to give the JVM some time to optimize.\r\n\r\n## Vary rows n, m fixed at 1000\r\n\r\n### Alpha Node\r\n| $k = 1000$ | $k = 10000$ |\r\n| --------------- | --------------- |\r\n| ![plot_alpha_n_1000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41760497/174668244-dec90cb2-4ded-4e8a-9b9a-16408c818809.svg) | ![plot_alpha_n_10000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41760497/174668238-c9f6b988-6b55-4c1f-845c-399ad6bf1ed0.svg) |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lima Node\r\n| $k = 1000$ | $k = 10000$ |\r\n| --------------- | --------------- |\r\n| ![plot_lima_n_1000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41760497/174668254-4fb11b22-b6b3-45c4-883c-572f469ec9b9.svg) | ![plot_lima_n_10000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41760497/174668248-2a6d2b1c-d4b7-4296-9fed-ed3fed8d84d1.svg) |\r\n\r\n## Vary cols m, n fixed at 1000\r\n\r\n### Alpha Node\r\n| $k = 1000$ | $k = 10000$ |\r\n| --------------- | --------------- |\r\n| ![plot_alpha_m_1000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41760497/174668241-3a829378-525b-464e-bf4e-9d1eff373125.svg) | ![plot_alpha_m_10000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41760497/174668233-7c5120a1-b243-4fa6-bf3a-2e0c05d75308.svg) |\r\n\r\n### Lima Node\r\n| $k = 1000$ | $k = 10000$ |\r\n| --------------- | --------------- |\r\n| ![plot_lima_m_1000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41760497/174668252-8fefdd71-dd72-4d24-a851-eea6f660b88d.svg) | ![plot_lima_m_10000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41760497/174668246-0824fbae-900f-49a9-9010-0edb8ffbc7fd.svg) |\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nThe implementation seems to boost the performance in most cases.

PR expands the existing Tokenisation to work with multi-threading, and additionally adds some minor features and bug fixes.\r\nMINOR bug fix: Removed hardcoded thread values in MultiColumnEncoder.\r\n\r\nTokenisation was moved into the `build` and `apply` paradigm as was introduced for `transformencode`. The multithreading implementation uses the same structure as `transformencode`. In the `build` stage the input gets split into tokens and saved in an internal representation, also additional metadata is computed which is then needed in the `apply` phase. During the `apply` the computed data is retrieved and written to the output. The current implementation splits the input frame into row partitions. Default is 64, which can be changed with the `sysds.parallel.tokenize.numBlocks` configuration. \r\nThis is the first implementation, some known issues are, (1) memory consumption, the execution DAG is not yet well optimized for memory consumption. This could be fixed in the future by computing subsets one after another (only possible when padding is enabled). (2) cache performance, similar issue as 1, by computing subsets first in a cache-aware (unrolling loops) manner performance could increase. \r\nThere is still quite some redundant code in the `TokenizerApplier`'s, although this is not so easy to clean up without a major refactor of the previous implementation. \r\nMultithreading is disabled per default at the moment, and can be activated via the `sysds.parallel.tokenize` config.\r\n\r\nIntroduced `ngram_type` as a configuration for the `ngram` tokenizer.\r\nDifferentiates between `token` and `document`.\r\n`token` creates the ngram over each token e.g. your tokens are ['hello', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'nice', 'pr'] a 3 ngram would give you the tokens ['hel', 'ell', 'llo', 'thi', 'his', 'nic', 'ice']\r\nif you would use `document`on the other hand, the ngram is computed over the tokens in the document giving you:\r\n['\"('hello', 'this', 'is')\"', '\"('this', 'is', 'a')\"', '\"('is', 'a', 'nice')\"', '\"('a', 'nice', 'pr')\"']\r\n\r\nIntroduced `apply_padding` for tokenizer spec, specifies if the output should be padded to `max_tokens`.","created_at":"2022-06-16T03:09:58Z","updated_at":"2022-07-11T09:48:48Z","closed_at":"2022-07-11T09:31:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d90d62bef84f315f8f8af354a1f67b1b433f0dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/40282e347e2ef24e15433cdb9854e6d632c91e9f","head":{"label":"ilovemesomeramen:mt_tokenize","ref":"mt_tokenize","sha":"40282e347e2ef24e15433cdb9854e6d632c91e9f","user":{"login":"ilovemesomeramen","id":8418379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTgzNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen","html_url":"https://github.com/ilovemesomeramen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":341013299,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDEwMTMyOTk=","name":"systemds","full_name":"ilovemesomeramen/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ilovemesomeramen","id":8418379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTgzNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen","html_url":"https://github.com/ilovemesomeramen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ilovemesomeramen/systemds","description":"Mirror

commit introduces a new column group called `ColGroupLinearFunctional`. The column group represents each column as a linear function (i.e., intercept & slope). Each linear function is computed such that it minimizes the quadratic distance to the data points in the respective column.\r\n\r\n`ColGroupLinearFunctional` implements\r\n- Efficient transposed self matrix multiplication `tsmm` (which runs in `O(numCols^2)`)\r\n- Multiplication with other `ColGroups` (which is especially efficient if another transposed `ColGroupLinearFunctional` is multiplied from the left) and with `MatrixBlock` (from the right)\r\n- `max`, `min`, `sum`, `sumSq`, `colProduct`, `colSums`, `colSumsSq`, `rowProduct`, `rowSums`, `decompressToDenseBlock`, `decompressToSparseBlock`\r\n\r\nThe implementations of `ColGroupLinearFunctional` and of the line-fitting module `LinearRegression` are accompanied by test

reworks our runtime replacement of CP instructions with FED versions when appropriate. \r\nSP replacement will be done in another PR.\r\n\r\nThis implementation was my second approach, the first one consisted of static methods in the FED instructions. I much prefer this one as it is quite clear which instructions are replaced, which constraints the CP imposes and we don't have to lead every check with an `instanceof` check. The downside of this approach is that it can get a bit confusing with inheritance, but it is---and will probably stay---manageable.\r\n\r\nNote that not everything is replaced yet, I will work on it while the general approach can already be reviewed.\r\n\r\nDuring the testing I found myself requiring to check if actual FED instructions are executed, is there a way to ensure this in the test framework, or is this already ensured in some way via privacy? Tests checking the heavy hitters do it implicitly.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I deleted a fix in `QuantilePickCPInstruction` (bf19244c909ae8354bc8b3da0985eaf448aa5f0c), as the common layout is no longer necessary and null is cleaner. This is intentional and the fix is no longer necessary.","created_at":"2022-06-07T14:03:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-18T14:11:03Z","closed_at":"2022-08-18T14:11:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9acb2a138f3c8da00c3ea4cb1db6ced47ff281fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1628/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1628/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1628/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/d48fe3d0d3a53f5eba305f103929f9def029f8bb","head":{"label":"kev-inn:cleanup_fed_instructions","ref":"cleanup_fed_instructions","sha":"d48fe3d0d3a53f5eba305f103929f9def029f8bb","user":{"login":"kev-inn","id":41760497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzYwNDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41760497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn","html_url":"https://github.com/kev-inn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251581266,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTE1ODEyNjY=","name":"systemml","full_name":"kev-inn/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kev-inn","id":41760497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzYwNDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41760497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn","html_url":"https://github.com/kev-inn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kev-inn/systemml","description":"Mirror

PR\r\n- adds a paragraph about multi-tenant federated learning in SystemDS and the respective limitations of a multi-tenant federated infrastructure to the python federated documentation.\r\n- changes the local variable map back to a basic HashMap instead of a ConcurrentHashMap, since we already handle the accesses in a safe way.\r\n- fixes the FederatedReuseSlicesTest by considering the lineage
