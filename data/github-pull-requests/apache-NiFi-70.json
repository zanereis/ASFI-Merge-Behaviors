PR is not ready to be merged. However, I wanted to go ahead and create a WIP PR so that those who are interested can look at, test, and provide feedback.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the unit tests do not work because the mocks don't implement all of the appropriate methods. As a result, they are @Ignore'd for now.\r\n\r\nAlso, more testing needs to be done to ensure that we are properly performing rollback's of un-acknowledged messages when the processor is stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-08T19:39:31Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T12:51:22Z","closed_at":"2018-06-11T12:51:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb9cefe1be904335579cf748284c7573225e18ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/2774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/2774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/1c5f07cb43d033ad249136022e30b8dbc9523bbc","head":{"label":"markap14:NIFI-4508","ref":"NIFI-4508","sha":"1c5f07cb43d033ad249136022e30b8dbc9523bbc","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52380182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjM4MDE4Mg==","name":"nifi","full_name":"markap14/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markap14/nifi","description":"Mirror

the Jira Statement:\r\n```\r\nI am using the ReplaceText processor to take a string input (example:  \r\n{\"name\":\"Smith\",\"middle\":\"nifi\",\"firstname\":\"John\"}\r\n) and change all the filed names to all uppercase.\r\nUsing above input as an example, I expect output like\r\n{\"NAME\":\"Smith\",\"MIDDLE\":\"nifi\",\"FIRSTNAME\":\"John\"}\r\nI expect I should be able to do this with ReplaceText processor; however, I see some unexpected behavior:\r\n-------\r\nTest 1: (uses EL in the replacement value property)\r\nSearch value:  \\\"([a-z]?)\\\":\\\"(.?)\\\"\r\nReplacement Value: \\\"${'$1':toUpper()}\":\\\"$2\\\"\r\nResult:\r\n{\"NAME\":\"Smith\",\"NAME\":\"nifi\",\"NAME\":\"John\"}\r\n-------\r\nTest 2: (Does not use EL in the replacement Value property)\r\nSearch value:  \\\"([a-z]?)\\\":\\\"(.?)\\\"\r\nReplacement Value: \\\"new$1\":\\\"$2\\\"\r\nResult:\r\n{\"newname\":\"Smith\",\"newmiddle\":\"nifi\",\"newfirstname\":\"John\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the processor evaluates the expression language before executing the regex and capture replacement.  The expression replaces the capture with the first value, and that is why the user was seeing that value repeated.\r\n\r\nThis pr changes the Regex evaluation of the processor to evaluate the regex first, and then run the expression on the result.\r\n\r\nSome changes where required for escaping values.\r\n\r\nI added tests for the reported issue and for escaping newlines etc that would break EL even if '' in a literal.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Createdata repository and log directories\r\n- Add explicit environment variable declarations to replace nifi-env.sh\r\n- Remove obsolete chown commands after user has already been switched to nifi\r\n\r\nHow I tested the changes:\r\n- I've ran `mvn package -P docker` in the nifi-docker folder to build the image. \r\n- I've made sure that `docker run --rm -ti apache/nifi` runs and start nifi using the new image\r\n- Made sure that all files are owned by the nifi user under /opt/nifi: `docker run --rm -ti --entrypoint /bin/bash apache/nifi -c \"find /opt/nifi ! -user nifi\"`\r\n- Checked that the expected environment variables are set:\r\n```\r\ndocker run --rm -ti --entrypoint /bin/bash apache/nifi -c \"env | grep

The only way to set credential for Proxy auth is setting System properties. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34877470/basic-proxy-authentication-for-https-urls-returns-http-1-0-407-proxy-authenticat/34980074\r\n- Azure EventHub processors (ConsumeAzureEventHub, GetAzureEventHub, PutAzureEventHub) do not support proxy because it uses proton-j in Apache Qpid Proton. IOHandler.handleBound uses Java NIO SocketChannel, which doesn't support Proxy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
