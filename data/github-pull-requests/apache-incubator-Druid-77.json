PR adds a new tool under `services` meant to assist with the following use case:\r\n\r\nUsers sometimes begin evaluating Druid with a simple deployment that uses local deep storage and Derby. After using the evaluation deployment for some time and ingesting some segments, they wish to move to MySQL or PostgreSQL and/or use a different deep storage, while keeping their old segments and ingestion setup.\r\n\r\nThis tool exports the contents of the following Druid tables:\r\n- segments\r\n- rules\r\n- config\r\n- datasource\r\n- supervisors\r\n\r\nThese tables are chosen since they contain non-transient (like task locks), non-historical entities (like task logs), as the tool is intended for migrations where the user shuts the entire cluster down.\r\n\r\nThe tool also allows users to specify a new S3 bucket/key, HDFS path, or new local filesystem path, and the entries from the segments table will be rewritten with new load specs. This is to assist with deep storage migration.\r\n\r\nCurrently only migration from local deep storage combined with Derby metadata is supported (the use case described above), the tool could be later expanded to handle other use cases.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-06T06:42:53Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T21:50:30Z","closed_at":"2019-05-07T06:39:41Z","merged_at":"2019-05-07T06:39:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"dadf6a2f11c00a1864c32f5e91e175543f83b5e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

detailed design and discussion is in issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6716\r\n**Target**\r\nsupport general exactly count distinct in Druid\r\n\r\n**Attention**\r\nthe pr is for branch master,  pr for 0.12.x is here(https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7582)\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n1. configure to use extension druid-uniq: druid.extensions.loadList=[...,\"druid-uniq\"]\r\n2. define a unique metric in  metricsSpec at Ingestion time\r\n ` \"metricsSpec\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"type\": \"count\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"count\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"name\": \"author_id_distinct\",\r\n                    \"type\":

\"timeseries\",\r\n  \"postAggregations\": [],\r\n  \"granularity\": \"ALL\",\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"druid_hadoop_task_example\",\r\n  \"intervals\": \"2018-04-24T00:00:00+08:00/2018-04-26T00:00:00+08:00\",\r\n  \"aggregations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"count\",\r\n      \"type\": \"count\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"author_id_distinct\",\r\n      \"type\": \"unique\",\r\n      \"fieldName\": \"author_id_distinct\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}`\r\n\r\n**Tips**\r\n1.if the cardinality of the unique column is too large, you can increase the map / reduce memory in

They are sized for hardware roughly based on Amazon's i3 series of EC2 instances.\r\n\r\nThe old tutorial cluster configuration has been replaced with `micro-quickstart`, with the tutorials also pointing users to the other single-server examples if they wish to use a bigger machine.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds example configurations for a clustered deployment based on the master/data/query

PR implements the first part of #7525, adding support for using multi-value string dimensions in the Druid expression language, as _either_ scalar string expressions _or_ explicitly as arrays and manipulating them with array functions. See the proposal of #7525 for additional details about the motivation and high level design descriptions. It might be easiest to see by example though, so here are a few takes on equivalent expressions which are possible with the additions of this PR.\r\n\r\nExamples are framed for a hypothetical 'twitter' datasource that ingests tweet events, collecting among other things a multi-value string dimension, 'hashtags'.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, Druid only provides facilities for operating on the individual strings contained in a multi-value row. This PR preserves this behavior, so the following is a valid expression to prefix any individual 'hashtags' value in a row with 'lol'. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"lol_concat\",\r\n  \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n  \"outputType\": \"STRING\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"concat('lol', hashtags)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces what I've classed as 'apply' functions, which apply a lambda in some manner to one or more arrays. These are the key to the magic that allows the above expression to function, but they can be used explicitly as well. This is an expression virtual column that produces results equivalent to the above expression:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"alt_lol_concat\",\r\n  \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n  \"outputType\": \"STRING\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"map((tag) -> concat('lol', tag), hashtags)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand is what will be done implicitly behind the scenes if the first version of the expression is used instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a handful of new array expressions, which we can use to operate on 'hashtags' explicitly as an array. One such function is `array_length`, which does what you might expect and evaluates to a number indicating how many elements are in the array.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"tag_count\",\r\n  \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n  \"outputType\": \"LONG\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"array_length(hashtags)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also compute the length of an array in a more round-about way with `fold`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"alternate_tag_count\",\r\n  \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n  \"outputType\": \"LONG\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"fold((tag, acc) -> acc + 1, hashtags, 0)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne new thing that I find particularly showcases how much more expressive this makes multi-value string dimensions, is that by joining the values together into a single string value with `array_to_string`, we can effectively make aggregation by a multi-value string dimension in a top-n or group-by query behave in a manner that is consistent with SQL array types, where grouping would be done for equivalent arrays, instead of the 'unnest' behavior that native Druid uses for multi-value string dimensions.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"all_tags_as_string\",\r\n  \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n  \"outputType\": \"STRING\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"array_to_string(hashtags,';')\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich of course you can also do with apply functions:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"alt_all_tags_as_string\",\r\n  \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n  \"outputType\": \"STRING\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"fold((tag, acc) -> concat(concat(acc, case_searched(acc == '', '', ';')), tag), hashtags, '')\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis can even be turned back into arrays in the final result set, of the correct type, with expression post-aggregators:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\":\"expression\",\r\n  \"name\":\"as_array\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"string_to_array(all_tags_as_string, ';')\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\":\"expression\",\r\n  \"name\":\"array_of_numbers\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"cast(string_to_array(some_numbers_as_string, ';'), 'LONG_ARRAY')\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis just scratches the surface, the proposal and docs and unit tests in this PR have more details. I am rather hyped for all of the unimaginable ways people will torture their Druid clusters with these new expressions, and I find them a lot of fun to play with.\r\n\r\n### Expression Language\r\nThe majority of changes are in the expression language itself, to support array types, array functions, and apply functions. The proposal issue goes over the grammar additions and new functions, but was light on the details of how magic happens, so I will try to elaborate.\r\n\r\nThe `Expr` interface has been expanded with a new method that is similar to the existing `visit` method, but instead of strictly examining the `Expr` tree, it instead allows creating a new `Expr` dynamically\r\n```\r\nExpr visit(Shuttle shuttle);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the `Shuttle` interface is very similar to the `Visitor` interface except it's `visit` method returns an `Expr`, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7588/files#diff-cbf2baec8ae5861fc7761e11d2fbf664R116\r\n\r\nCurrently, all `Expr` rewriting happens in the method `Parser.applyUnappliedIdentifiers`, which expression selectors use to transform any expressions that are using multi-value input bindings in a scalar manner, adding apply functions and lifting variables into the lambdas of apply functions as appropriate. \r\n\r\n`Expr` also provides a new `BindingDetails` type that is produced by a `analyzeInputs` method on any `Expr` implementation. This type captures the set of 'free' variables (variables that must have input provided by a binding at eval time), as well as which free variables are used as scalar types and which are used as array types, for the entire tree of that `Expr`. This information is used in conjunction with details about the input columns themselves to determine which input variables need to be 'applied' by `Parser.applyUnappliedIdentifiers`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expression Virtual Columns\r\nThe majority of changes here are focused in `ExpressionSelectors`, which now includes additional logic that examines the columns which make up the bindings used to evaluate the expression, and calls into `Parser.examineBindings` to get the details of how those inputs are used within the expression, enabling transformation of the expression with `Parser.applyUnappliedIdentifiers` as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThere is also a deficiency here that really needs fixed, namely that type information of selectors we are going to feed into the input bindings comes from the `ColumnCapabilities` from a selector factory, which is not always reliable and sometimes does not exist at all (nested group-by, postaggs, etc). The 'adapter' selectors do not have this problem, they can be trusted to have full `ColumnCapabilities` for all input bindings since there is a segment backing, but row based selectors can not currently reliably provide this information.\r\n\r\nTo deal with this, there is a fallback expression selector, which I'm currently calling `RowBasedExpressionColumnValueSelector`, which examines the object bindings for any 'unknown' variables on a row by row basis to find list inputs, and use the correct expression for the inputs. This is suboptimal. As a crutch to detect this scenario, for now I have added a method I hate to `ColumnCapabilities`, [`isComplete`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7588/files#diff-ec18ecc5e0e4420b6720e6a6fd55fb7fR41), which is set by selector factories which can be 'trusted' to indicate which columns support multiple values and provide generally reliable information, to determine when we need to use the fallback `RowBasedExpressionColumnValueSelector` for cases for selectors that do not.\r\n\r\nI believe this fallback selector could be nearly (or maybe entirely) eliminated by enriching the type system to preserve information all the way through, and I'm putting together a proposal to address this, because not having consistent type information in the processing pipeline is related to [other](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/7660) [problems](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7719) as well. But for now, there will probably be some performance casualties where we have to use this fallback selector instead of a more optimal selector if we had complete type information that we could trust.\r\n\r\nBeyond all the unit tests added, this PR is also reasonably well tested both in a 'debugging' cluster capacity on my laptop with a wide range of contrived multi-value test data, as well as an actual test cluster that has the previously mentioned 'twitter' datasource. I have been trying to break the 'magic' expression transformations as much as possible, and while I suspect there are still some missing cases, I have reasonable confidence in it doing the right thing much of the time.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of #7525, including adding SQL operators for the new array function expressions, will be done in one or more follow-up

PR implements the following change described in #7563:\r\n\r\n> The permissions needed for system table access could be adjusted to not require additional permissions beyond datasource-specific permissions for non-server related info (segments, tasks) and to require STATE-read permissions for server-related tables (servers, server_segments) to be consistent with the non-SQL APIs.\r\n\r\nA STATE.READ permission check is added to `server_segments` sys table handling (`servers` already had one, and #7567 removed the unnecessary `sys` datasource check).\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds integration tests for sys schema + auth. A new segment and task for `auth_test` datasource are inserted directly into metadata during IT setup, and this datasource is used for testing the auth checks.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-30T03:56:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T14:18:03Z","closed_at":"2019-05-02T14:18:03Z","merged_at":"2019-05-02T14:18:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"a013350018d96cbb40944a0b5e060d510eeabdbc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

PR implements the GUI part of #7502 and depends on #7531 being merged.\r\nThe data loader / spec editor is fully functional for `index` and `index_parallel` tasks and with a few more changes and also #7566 being merged it will be able to handle streaming data also (but there is no need to wait for #7566).\r\n\r\nSince this PR required so much UI work a lot of other goodies in the console were updated to accommodate it:\r\n\r\n- Remove mocha and use jest exclusively\r\n- Add helper scripts to generate components\r\n- Massively improve the `AutoForm` to be flexible enough for all the new use-cases in the code\r\n- Rearrange the header to accommodate the new view (in particular rename `SQL` to `Query` so it is a verb)\r\n- Added some nice object modification utils\r\n- Encapsulated QueryState into a class\r\n- Improved the webpack dev server `npm start` script API\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of the Schema design page:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/56928797-c5eb2b00-6a8c-11e9-882a-98e0c63c7364.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-29T21:42:00Z","updated_at":"2019-05-04T15:28:27Z","closed_at":"2019-05-04T00:14:58Z","merged_at":"2019-05-04T00:14:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"baf54f373cec583d5f93c4f7d6cf6c25869eefd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

feature allows Calcite's Bindable interpreter to be bolted on\r\ntop of Druid queries and table scans. I think it should be removed for\r\na few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is not recommended for production anyway, because it generates\r\nunscalable query plans (e.g. it will plan a join into two table scans\r\nand then try to do the entire join in memory on the broker).\r\n2. It doesn't work with Druid-specific SQL functions, like TIME_FLOOR,\r\nREGEXP_EXTRACT, APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT, etc.\r\n3. It makes the SQL planning code needlessly complicated.\r\n\r\nWith SQL coming out of experimental status soon, it's a good opportunity\r\nto remove this

I am certainly open to revisiting that and making this more than an on/off switch.

for the huge PR. I tried to split into sub PRs, but I think it's not easy split more because new changes for segment locking are tightly coupled together and it won't be easy to understand if they are in separate PRs. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/7491 and now it's ready for review.\r\n\r\nHere are the key classes to be reviewed.\r\n\r\n### Overshadowable\r\n\r\nNew interface to represent a class which can have overshadow relation between its instances. Ex) dataSegment\r\n\r\n### ShardSpecFactory\r\n\r\nNew interface to be used to allocate segments remotely in the overlord.\r\n\r\n### NumberedOverwriteShardSpec\r\n\r\nNew shardSpec for segments which may overshadow others with their minor version.\r\n\r\n### DataSegment\r\n\r\n- `getVersion` is renamed to `getMajorVersion`.\r\n- Some short circuit methods to check overshadow relation between segments.\r\n\r\n### VersionedIntervalTimeline\r\n\r\nImproved to consider the new overshadow relation properly.\r\n\r\n### OvershadowableManager\r\n\r\nA new class manages the state of AtomicUpdateGroup.\r\n\r\n### AtomicUpdateGruop\r\n\r\nA set of PartitionChunks which should be atomically visible or not in the timeline.\r\n\r\n### SegmentTransactionalInsertAction\r\n\r\nAdded a new parameter `segmentsToBeOverwritten`. Shouldn't be empty if the new segments are created with segment locks.\r\n\r\n### AbstractBatchIndexTask\r\n\r\nAbstract class for batch tasks like indexTask or parallelIndexTask. Provides some methods for easily acquiring task locks.\r\n\r\n### IndexTaskSegmentAllocator\r\n\r\nSegment allocator interface for only IndexTask. It has 3 different modes for allocating segments.\r\n\r\nThe new segment locking is currently available for only Kafka/Kinesis index task, index task, and parallel index task.\r\n\r\nThis PR is marked as `Incompatible` because it introduces a new shardSpec. It's not possible to roll back after this PR. For rolling update while kafka/kinesis indexing service is running, any kind of overwriting tasks (including compaction task and index task) should be stopped first. Otherwise, kafka/kinesis index tasks might fail when they list segments with the new shardSpec generated by overwriting tasks. Native parallel index tasks cannot be run in middleManagers of mixed versions, so they should be stopped first before update.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is a known issue of potential race in task locking. If two or more overwriting tasks try to acquire segment locks for overlapped sets of segments, each task acquires locks one by one per segment in the current implementation. This may lead to failures of both tasks if they hold locks necessary for each other. However, I think this happens rarely and so will fix in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nI've been testing this PR in our in-house cluster since I raised this PR and it looks fine so far.","created_at":"2019-04-25T00:49:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T03:16:31Z","closed_at":"2019-07-25T00:35:47Z","merged_at":"2019-07-25T00:35:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"db149462073d59e7563f0d3834e69d44a2bb4011","assignee":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

patch fixes the following 2 bugs introduced in #7133:\r\n\r\n1) ClassCastException is thrown when a timestamp less than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` is being scan queried with a ASCENDING or DESCENDING time-ordering.  The original timestamp comparator was written to assume that all timestamps are longs.  However, if a timestamp less than the maximum integer value is used, the broker will parse the value as an Integer.  Since Integers can't be cast to Longs, an exception is thrown.  This patch introduces a type check for timestamps that properly parses it if it's either an Integer or a Long.\r\n\r\n2) UnsupportedOperationException is thrown when time-ordered scan querying a realtime segment.  In the case of published segments, there's a 1:1 mapping between query runners and segment descriptors.  The existing implementation relied on this mapping to calculate which query runners corresponded to each interval.  However, this mapping doesn't exist when querying a realtime segment since a query runner is generated for each hydrant but only one segment descriptor is generated.  This patch introduces a `SinkQueryRunners` class that implements `Iterable<QueryRunner>` and holds mappings between intervals and query runners.\r\n\r\nThis patch was validated on an in-house cluster.\r\n\r\nThe following types of queries have been tested for regressions:\r\n- Scan\r\n- GroupBy\r\n- Timeseries\r\n- TopN\r\n- Search\r\n- Segment

of the sampler component of #7502. \r\n\r\nRuns on the overlord and exposes an endpoint on `POST /druid/indexer/v1/sampler` that returns sampled data for use by the data loader GUI. This is currently intended as an internal-only endpoint and is intentionally not documented.\r\n\r\nChanges are as minimally-invasive as possible, and most code is confined to the `org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.sampler` package. Additional methods were added to `Firehose` (returning the raw rows) and `FirehoseFactory` (adding a `connectForSampler` method that signals to the implementation that we only care about a few rows and to skip things like prefetching and caching) to improve the sampling experience; default implementations do 'the right thing' if not implemented.\r\n\r\nThere are a few 'hacks' added to make the API a bit nicer - i.e. allowing the sampler to work if no `dataSchema` is provided, in which case it just returns the raw rows if possible and marks everything as unparseable (since no parser was provided).","created_at":"2019-04-23T20:36:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T05:47:22Z","closed_at":"2019-05-02T05:37:15Z","merged_at":"2019-05-02T05:37:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec8562c885f212d1c070a40322001a3da8048a0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design

is an interface to provide RESTful APIs and some tasks are using it to communicate with other Druid modules. When a chatHanlder API is called, `ChatHandlerResource` checks the current running task is the expected callee. Before 0.14, it checked `taskId` as it is, but after https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/6761, it encodes `taskId` before comparing it. This breaks the backwards compatibility, especially when middleManagers of different versions are running in the same cluster. If `taskId` doesn't match, `ChatHandlerResource` returns null which just returns `NOT_FOUND` error (404) with no message which makes debugging harder.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the compatibility issue and improves `ChatHandlerResource` to return `BAD_REQUEST` error with a proper message when `taskId` doesn't

PR refactors the `druid-bloom-filter` extension aggregators to strictly use `ByteBuffer` representation of `BloomKFilter` and buffer based methods to manipulate them in place, allowing for combined `Aggregator` and `BufferAggregator` implementations and vastly simplifying the code. It also fixes a bug in the `combine` logic of the current implementation, resulting from the mixed use of `BloomKFilter` and `ByteBuffer` (the current implementation only can combine `BloomKFilter`, but the broker will receive `byte[]` from the historicals, resulting in a cast exception).\r\n\r\nOriginally introduced in #6397, the PR sort of grew organically over its 41 commit lifetime; from starting out where it only dealt with `BloomKFilter` on heap and suffered the overhead of a lot of serde, to where it ended up, which mixed usage of `BloomKFilter` and `ByteBuffer` after adding some methods to optimize the `BufferAggregator` implementation, done in an attempt to reduce the overhead of serializing and deserializing such potentially large values so often, and picking up a bug or two along the way.\r\n\r\nThis new approach combines implementations of both types of the aggregators and now _always_ operates with `ByteBuffer`. The `BloomFilterAggregatorFactory` and `BloomFilterMergeAggregatorFactory` construct the `Aggregator` and `BufferAggregator` implementations with a perhaps not greatly named boolean parameter on the constructor, `onHeap`. If `onHeap` is set to `true`, the aggregator will allocate an appropriately sized `ByteBuffer` to hold a `BloomKFilter` allow usage as an `Aggregator`, and if not must rely on the `ByteBuffer` that will be passed to it's methods during it's life as a `BufferAggregator`. \r\n\r\nThere is probably room for improvement to make this a bit more elegant, maybe making the aggregator constructors private and adding static methods to more explicitly construct either an `Aggregator` with `onHeap = true`, or a `BufferAggregator` with `onHeap = false`? Regardless, this eliminates all of the extra serde and should be a lot more simple to reason about and troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nI have tested with top-n, timeseries, and group-by queries on a small test cluster with multiple-historical spun up on my laptop, and things look good so far.","created_at":"2019-04-17T06:18:05Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T22:20:59Z","closed_at":"2019-04-18T18:54:07Z","merged_at":"2019-04-18T18:54:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"be65cca248d7b3dd5ebacc2a537aa3d25d420475","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

introduced two bugs:\r\n\r\n1) Unpublished realtime segments were unqueryable when ordering on time using scan queries.  The SinkQuerySegmentWalker creates a QueryRunner with a SpecificSegmentSpec...however, the implementation for time-ordering was written to only accept MultipleSpecificSegmentSpecs.  This manifested itself as a UnsupportedOperationException whenever a realtime segment was queried. \r\n This PR updates the implementation to accept both MultipleSpecificSegmentSpecs and SpecificSegmentSpecs and adds corresponding tests.\r\n\r\n2) Non-time-ordered scan queries without a time-column were failing because a descending time-ordering was still trying to be used when merging results from several historicals on the broker.  This PR updates the result ordering to be `Ordering.natural()` when time ordering is `None` and adds nicer InvalidStateExceptions that are thrown when scan result values are trying to be time-ordered

timestamps.","created_at":"2019-04-11T23:27:14Z","updated_at":"2019-04-13T02:08:35Z","closed_at":"2019-04-13T02:08:35Z","merged_at":"2019-04-13T02:08:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"85f10ed0d0df0e040a5448ce8b99a2c972537381","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area
