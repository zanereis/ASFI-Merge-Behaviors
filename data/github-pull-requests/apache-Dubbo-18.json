easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-06T07:22:20Z","updated_at":"2023-05-07T23:42:50Z","closed_at":"2023-05-07T23:42:49Z","merged_at":"2023-05-07T23:42:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed6afe1ac34c0ddf5b3805254700488b7a7efb4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a57350ff8424ebb291ed85f0df65b4ee0533cc61","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0506_bom","ref":"0506_bom","sha":"a57350ff8424ebb291ed85f0df65b4ee0533cc61","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-04T14:18:54Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T15:42:19Z","closed_at":"2023-05-05T08:18:32Z","merged_at":"2023-05-05T08:18:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5f8ce64787cbb17628ac5176947d46a457ee0ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12232/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12232/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12232/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3ddd57766745079975cae5f4992a3570082dd248","head":{"label":"icodening:auto_stub","ref":"auto_stub","sha":"3ddd57766745079975cae5f4992a3570082dd248","user":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460051832,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2vVeA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icodening/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icodening/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-04T07:04:10Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T15:37:30Z","closed_at":"2023-05-05T12:26:35Z","merged_at":"2023-05-05T12:26:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"471f44b52d979d50102618d12864006ceb1152e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/05fa9ed0370de8e972c26a9ebd4dcc5ab7e48c06","head":{"label":"XIACYBING:fix-unsuitedInvoke","ref":"fix-unsuitedInvoke","sha":"05fa9ed0370de8e972c26a9ebd4dcc5ab7e48c06","user":{"login":"XIACYBING","id":39894036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODk0MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39894036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING","html_url":"https://github.com/XIACYBING","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":401593115,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDE1OTMxMTU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"XIACYBING/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XIACYBING","id":39894036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODk0MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39894036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING","html_url":"https://github.com/XIACYBING","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIACYBING/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XIACYBING/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-04T03:26:13Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T03:31:13Z","closed_at":"2023-05-05T03:31:08Z","merged_at":"2023-05-05T03:31:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d9df821942c5261627cd5008d87b43a8fddcc6d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12228/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12228/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12228/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bdfed8e619c527a8c69309308dd3bc08e48371f8","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/lost_spring6_module","ref":"fix/lost_spring6_module","sha":"bdfed8e619c527a8c69309308dd3bc08e48371f8","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-04T02:36:42Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T05:01:41Z","closed_at":"2023-05-04T05:01:41Z","merged_at":"2023-05-04T05:01:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"0724e94da7fe3d1eebdb1dab928129ffcc0e4716","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12226/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12226/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12226/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bec1e95cbd167f03ae4ac302f73d979161921d53","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0504_key","ref":"0504_key","sha":"bec1e95cbd167f03ae4ac302f73d979161921d53","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nIssue Number: close https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/12153\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nThe MergingDigest data structure of the t-Digest package uses a cache with a default size (1050) to improve efficiency, and the cache increments by +1 each time it is added.\r\nIf the cache is full, the space will be merged and tempUsed=0 will be reset. In this process, there are common concurrency problems in the judgment and merge methods, which need to be fixed.\r\n1. Add synchronized to the mergeNewValues ​​method. This method will be executed about 1050 times (the reason for the 0.1% error rate), so there is no need to worry about performance issues.\r\n2. Add volatile modification\r\n3. Because the source code of t-Digest  cannot be modified directly, copy the corresponding code to the dubbo source code separately\r\n\r\n```java\r\n private void add(double x, int w, List<Double> history) {\r\n        if (Double.isNaN(x)) {\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Cannot add NaN to t-digest\");\r\n        }\r\n        if (tempUsed >= tempWeight.length - lastUsedCell - 1) {  //判断是否达到缓存上限，tempWeight.length =1050\r\n            mergeNewValues();\r\n        }\r\n        int where = tempUsed++;    // 每次add自增\r\n        // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38374721/235847378-e80c5ee7-6a38-4f1b-92a0-9be058474c76.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nsee testcase testMulti, also as follow:\r\n1、git pull  3.2\r\n2、modify the ConsumerApplication code of dubbo-demo-spring-boot-consumer as follows. About 0.1% error rate before the change, no error rate after the change\r\n\r\n```java\r\n public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\r\n        ConfigurableApplicationContext context =

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-02T13:22:13Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T02:42:01Z","closed_at":"2023-05-03T02:42:00Z","merged_at":"2023-05-03T02:42:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"bdc0695d780142be49ef06b32170e03c53b88c09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ae75551141423a5952dbc853327a051bda037073","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0502_compat","ref":"0502_compat","sha":"ae75551141423a5952dbc853327a051bda037073","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-25T08:41:16Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T06:29:52Z","closed_at":"2023-04-26T06:29:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"396d94f7db06fce51c71dfb3b4313d9ff4c2a832","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/53c7236ef8bbe5e164b0f73a5005006444eaca9c","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-packable-method-extension","ref":"3.2-packable-method-extension","sha":"53c7236ef8bbe5e164b0f73a5005006444eaca9c","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-24T03:33:18Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T06:18:39Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T06:18:39Z","merged_at":"2023-04-25T06:18:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb00a8a391195472a32695674a6f506636b90927","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9bb42247cf2e3e2aa5194f815e4811f806a09541","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0424_cache","ref":"0424_cache","sha":"9bb42247cf2e3e2aa5194f815e4811f806a09541","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-24T02:06:40Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T06:16:57Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T06:16:57Z","merged_at":"2023-04-25T06:16:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"9687e48949792f5580847b12ff8680b93b85bd2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a4e54de972145f4f135106d6d2540ea64befa86e","head":{"label":"ShenFeng312:polish_comments_and_logs","ref":"polish_comments_and_logs","sha":"a4e54de972145f4f135106d6d2540ea64befa86e","user":{"login":"ShenFeng312","id":49786112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg2MTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49786112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312","html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":594323834,"node_id":"R_kgDOI2ypeg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ShenFeng312/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ShenFeng312","id":49786112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg2MTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49786112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312","html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-21T06:21:24Z","updated_at":"2023-05-22T13:58:28Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T03:49:43Z","merged_at":"2023-04-25T03:49:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"316d9536180d708527fc6aa4b2b4bdc6a0d42e1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/81696889b970b7feeb5b0ba57af7de71952dbba3","head":{"label":"MartinDai:issue-12130","ref":"issue-12130","sha":"81696889b970b7feeb5b0ba57af7de71952dbba3","user":{"login":"MartinDai","id":11816720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODE2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11816720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinDai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":630280248,"node_id":"R_kgDOJZFQOA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"MartinDai/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MartinDai","id":11816720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODE2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11816720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinDai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinDai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MartinDai/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix #10681\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-20T01:49:05Z","updated_at":"2023-04-28T02:27:59Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12140/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12140/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12140/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a218f5d4feb59e16d067d15e8ebbefe3f3c6670c","head":{"label":"ShenFeng312:support_dynamic_cluster","ref":"support_dynamic_cluster","sha":"a218f5d4feb59e16d067d15e8ebbefe3f3c6670c","user":{"login":"ShenFeng312","id":49786112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg2MTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49786112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312","html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":594323834,"node_id":"R_kgDOI2ypeg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ShenFeng312/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ShenFeng312","id":49786112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg2MTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49786112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312","html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-19T12:04:40Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T01:42:00Z","closed_at":"2023-04-20T01:42:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8968a71f35d74ce2a6f9f22e01344ee9d11f6bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/93a436b4e6ef739cc904af88dcdfc623b87e4300","head":{"label":"QuentinYo:add_log","ref":"add_log","sha":"93a436b4e6ef739cc904af88dcdfc623b87e4300","user":{"login":"QuentinYo","id":7312478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTI0Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7312478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo","html_url":"https://github.com/QuentinYo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627843672,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWwiWA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"QuentinYo/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"QuentinYo","id":7312478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTI0Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7312478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo","html_url":"https://github.com/QuentinYo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/QuentinYo/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`ZipkinAutoConfiguration` create Zipkin sender and exporter when you are using Boot < 3.0 or you are not using spring-boot-starter-actuator.\r\nWhen you use SpringBoot 3.*, priority should be given to loading S3 related configurations. Dubbo related zipkin configurations are invalid.\r\n\r\nspringboot3 zipkin config:\r\n```yaml\r\nmanagement:\r\n  zipkin:\r\n    tracing:\r\n      endpoint: http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-18T13:07:34Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T07:02:31Z","closed_at":"2023-04-24T11:50:06Z","merged_at":"2023-04-24T11:50:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"48bd823253abee73fa8c39dec0938b5affe7d374","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12124/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12124/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12124/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f47ee1dc36c6be84ea536e32d2a8348ecc9f17b5","head":{"label":"conghuhu:cgq","ref":"cgq","sha":"f47ee1dc36c6be84ea536e32d2a8348ecc9f17b5","user":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":544346536,"node_id":"R_kgDOIHIRqA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"conghuhu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-17T13:40:04Z","updated_at":"2023-04-17T13:40:35Z","closed_at":"2023-04-17T13:40:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6e787b0bcdc0348766dc999c3e47333844fe8091","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"6e787b0bcdc0348766dc999c3e47333844fe8091","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-17T08:07:21Z","updated_at":"2023-04-18T02:04:56Z","closed_at":"2023-04-18T02:04:52Z","merged_at":"2023-04-18T02:04:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"43bbf9f727fd2a9423e7e958a6bd0b3f0f89d6b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12109/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12109/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12109/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/34979d69de3c9e4d700dcc6bda0627d495927ae7","head":{"label":"EarthChen:refactor-protobuf-version","ref":"refactor-protobuf-version","sha":"34979d69de3c9e4d700dcc6bda0627d495927ae7","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"6e787b0bcdc0348766dc999c3e47333844fe8091","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfix issue https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/12064\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nfix: destroy dubbo server before cleaning repository\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-14T10:54:52Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T07:16:17Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92819a52219eff370f64168173fd68dd400cf917","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12095/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12095/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12095/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/34e8c606eff93bbfe47fad40923bdc3fed7f0571","head":{"label":"QuentinYo:fix_shutdown","ref":"fix_shutdown","sha":"34e8c606eff93bbfe47fad40923bdc3fed7f0571","user":{"login":"QuentinYo","id":7312478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTI0Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7312478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo","html_url":"https://github.com/QuentinYo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627843672,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWwiWA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"QuentinYo/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"QuentinYo","id":7312478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTI0Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7312478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo","html_url":"https://github.com/QuentinYo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinYo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/QuentinYo/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-12T13:50:00Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T16:07:51Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T16:07:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c113bfa49b9d43d578bf6d1ee9ea7c34643a915","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/38b458d0db2786432ece59161ccbd31b2d5e1ef1","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/3.2_dubbo_rest_protocol_demo","ref":"feature/3.2_dubbo_rest_protocol_demo","sha":"38b458d0db2786432ece59161ccbd31b2d5e1ef1","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"7e3064f9b695fc1fa2d07ca062de2461f0d42650","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n1. Support annotations and xml in native image scenarios\r\n2. Support native combination with springboot3\r\n3. Support automatic scanning of exposed services and referenced services in the way of spring configuration, and generate native image configuration files according to the scanning results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The original native image judgment method is abolished, and the standard image code is used to judge whether it is executed in the native environment\r\n2. dubbo will be compiled in jdk17 environment\r\n3. In native image mode: JSON and the corresponding implementation are automatically loaded and compiled through spi, and renamed to JsonUtil\r\n4. Support automatic identification of higher version of PostProcessor, used to complete AOT in compilation stage, such as ServiceAnnotationWithAotPostProcessor and ServiceAnnotationWithAotPostProcessor.\r\n5. Support API to inject native image configuration information required for compilation, which is used to temporarily solve the problem that third-party packages do not support native image\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-11T10:57:35Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T13:29:30Z","closed_at":"2023-04-11T13:29:30Z","merged_at":"2023-04-11T13:29:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"94a50e5d4e7f937ac3df4b12cdaa9bb1c45593ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/791c0301cc2b9a61405e076db8ca6b61313678aa","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0411_executor","ref":"0411_executor","sha":"791c0301cc2b9a61405e076db8ca6b61313678aa","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-11T09:40:37Z","updated_at":"2023-05-08T09:02:53Z","closed_at":"2023-04-12T12:02:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a64d6b81ae91d6924ae650423c9f1ff47d010a8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12066/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12066/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12066/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9388d862cd0a1d78bce854fe7548864bff304110","head":{"label":"KamToHung:optimize-JsonUtils","ref":"optimize-JsonUtils","sha":"9388d862cd0a1d78bce854fe7548864bff304110","user":{"login":"KamToHung","id":16450524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDUwNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16450524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung","html_url":"https://github.com/KamToHung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":514895986,"node_id":"R_kgDOHrCwcg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"KamToHung/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KamToHung","id":16450524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDUwNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16450524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung","html_url":"https://github.com/KamToHung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KamToHung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KamToHung/dubbo","description":"Apache
