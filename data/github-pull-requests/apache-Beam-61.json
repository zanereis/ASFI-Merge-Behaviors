the OutputSampler coder would always be the Value coder (from a windowed value). This would cause a mismatch between the encoding for the PCollection defined in the ProcessBundleDescriptor vs. what is being given to the OutputSampler. The fix is to always sample WindowedValues and give the OutputSampler the literal rehydrated coder.\r\n\r\nTask #25064\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

SDK's dataflow pipeline option recognizes \"--worker_machine_type\" but [dataflow API](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/rest/v1b3/projects.locations.flexTemplates/launch#FlexTemplateRuntimeEnvironment) has `machineType` option. This discrepancy causes pipeline launch failure when running a dataflow flex-template.\r\n\r\nActually in Python SDK where '--worker_machine_type', '--machine_type' are the same: https://github.com/aaltay/beam/blob/0290315623d2734563b6b163257a160045c1ad6c/sdks/python/apache_beam/options/pipeline_options.py#L948\r\n\r\nThis PR makes '--machine_type' the alias of \"--worker_machine_type\". However the flag package standard go library does not support alias: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35761 (closed as won't do). A littble bit less straightforward approach is needed.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

have report that users pass in values like `withMinRam(1073741824 * 16)` crashes the pipeline after job starts. This is due to java literal int overflow: `1073741824 * 16 = 0`. While this can be avoided by setting up spotbug guard. It is nice to have a more obvious logging for this error.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

runners may choose to apply optimizations to a pipeline before it is executed. A key optimization, fusion, relates to ParDo operations. If one ParDo operation produces a PCollection that is then consumed as the main input of another ParDo operation, the two ParDo operations will be fused together into a single ParDo operation and run in a single pass; this is \"producer-consumer fusion\".\r\n\r\nThis PR implements producer-consumer fusion for sequential ParDos in the Spark Dataset runner.\r\n\r\nCloses #25761\r\nThis is also a follow up (optimization) regarding https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/25732.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is the second patch of migrating Flink runner to execute batch jobs with DataStream API.\r\n\r\nThis patch does the following:\r\n1. Add a new option of `UseDataStreamForBatch`. When it is set to true, the batch jobs will be executed with DataStream API. Otherwise, the jobs are executed with DataSet API.\r\n2. Modify the pipeline translation path to honor the configuration.\r\n3. Modify the tests to cover the DataStream execution path.\r\n\r\nThis patch should be merged after #25741 is resolved, so the streaming jobs metrics are still backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nfix #25740\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

found that running everything at once led to dropped jobs and conflicts between jobs (e.g. Gradle issues, Jenkins worker failures). This helped dramatically (I only had one or two jobs with Jenkins issues when I did this, as opposed to 20+). It also avoids harming the Jenkins experience for others who are planning on doing normal CI.\r\n\r\nI also removed `Java Portability examples on Dataflow with Java 11` since it doesn't seem to be a real postcommit (see https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/25600#issuecomment-1452519866)\r\n\r\nThis will cause the script to run for around 1.25 hours, but shouldn't make a huge difference in the time to completion of the jobs themselves since a full Jenkins queue tends to be the blocker here anyways.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[github.com/tetratelabs/wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) from 1.0.0-pre.9 to 1.0.0-rc.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>wazero v1.0.0-rc.1 starts our journey towards 1.0, with no public API changes. We will have at least one more release candidate between now and 1.0, in a week or two. The next candidate will include CLI binaries, which will allow our non-Go community to use wazero without installing Go, first.</p>\n<p>wazero 1.0 will happen March 24th, during the wazero release party at <a href=\"https://wasmio.tech/\">wasmio</a> hosted by <a href=\"https://tetrate.io/\">Tetrate</a>. Follow <a href=\"https://evacchi.github.io/\">Edoardo</a> for updates on on the party, who's doing great job organizing including lightning talks by end users.</p>\n<p>Many of you have requested a community page on our website. We added <a href=\"https://wazero.io/community/\">this</a> including a list of <a href=\"https://wazero.io/community/users/\">users</a> who explicitly opted in. The user list is opt-in, and generally higher signal than the &quot;Used By&quot; list on the <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero\">GitHub site</a>, as the latter includes transient dependencies.</p>\n<p>The biggest internal code change in v1.0.0-rc.1 let to wazero passing the entire wasi-testsuite on linux, darwin (macOS) and windows, with zero exceptions. To do so took tens of days of effort from both <a href=\"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt\"><code>@​codefromthecrypt</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a>, and described at the bottom for the curious. By passing every test defined by WebAssembly, as well stdlib tests in TinyGo and Zig, it is easier for end users to feel confident wazero is a great choice for stability. This is worth the couple weeks of pain.</p>\n<p>We intentionally didn't do any other large changes, but there were several people to thank for minor changes. Some of the below took many days of effort each!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> for refactoring an internal type with generics so we can use it for open directories.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ckaznocha\"><code>@​ckaznocha</code></a> for fixing a concurrency issue on context cancellation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> for a mountain of optimizations to reduce compilation overhead</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dmvolod\"><code>@​dmvolod</code></a> for removing a redundant wasm decoding validation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> for adding <code>-timeout duration</code> to the CLI which stops runaway processes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> for fixing a corner case around max memory limit</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> for allowing the CLI to be built with an external version (for packaging)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In closing, thanks very much for sticking with us this last year and a half almost, leading to 1.0. Our fantastic ecosystem is the reason you have a zero dependency runtime, something you can embed without thinking about work or version clashes with other tools. We've done great work together to bring Go forward in the WebAssembly ecosystem, and people are noticing!</p>\n<h3>Notes on wasi-testsuite compliance</h3>\n<p>Most people don't need to read this part, so only do if you are interested in low level details, or bored!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite\">wasi-testsuite</a> compliance means passing tests that verify the expected behaviors of <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/snapshot-01/phases/snapshot/docs.md\">wasi_snapshot_preview1</a>, as decided by the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/Charter.md\">WASI W3C subgroup</a>. It does so by running tests compiled in different languages, currently AssemblyScript, C and Rust.</p>\n<p>As described at the beginning of the release notes, wazero v1.0.0-rc.1 passes all tests as doing so is least confusing to the ecosystem. This means passing things we don't advise or agree with. Our former release left out a couple tests due to performance overhead, but we pass them now despite it. If you care about this, read on!</p>\n<p>The last pre-release skipped a test on dot and dot-dot entries in directory listings. <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/os/dir_unix.go#L107-L110\">Go throws away these entries</a> before we can read them. To resurrect them costs tens of microseconds. The cost is fixed overhead around inodes, but this same topic has a large performance footprint when multiplied in directory listings.</p>\n<p>Recently, a test was added to require inode data (file serial numbers) inside all directory listings. For example, if your directory includes &quot;wazero.txt&quot;, a non-zero inode must be returned</p>\n<p>inode data isn't typically used except comparing file identity, and even then requires the device to do so properly. For example, Go has a <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/os#SameFile\">SameFile</a> function which lazily gets this data, as it is well.. expensive. wasi-libc <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pull/345\">made a change</a> recently to fetch this data regardless of it it is used or not. Not all compilers use wasi-libc, for example Zig has their own directory logic. However, at least C and Rust do, so mitigating this problem became an issue for us, not just for the spectest, but the underlying logic in wasi-libc. Specifically, compilers that use wasi-libc 17+ will perform a guest side stat fan-out when the ino returned is zero. Doing a guest-side fan out is much more expensive than host side.</p>\n<p>This problem is roughly analogous to <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/os#File.ReadDir\">ReadDir</a> vs <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/os#File.Readdir\">Readdir</a> problem in Go. The lower-d version says &quot;Most clients are better served by the more efficient ReadDir method&quot;, ultimately due to an internal stat fanout in worst case. Unfortunately, the performance impact is worse than upper vs lower d readdir in go. In windows, the inode information isn't in the <code>FileInfo.Sys</code> data, so there's an additional N syscalls to get it from somewhere else.</p>\n<p>System performance isn't consistent, but compliance with WASI on this is at least in tens of microseconds additional overhead on directory listings, and it is also linear wrt directory size. Not all users will list directories at after configuration time, neither will all find this overhead intolerable even if they did.</p>\n<p>In case you are curious, we did discuss these topics at length with the WASI maintainers. The end of it is that this performance overhead is something they feel as a least bad option of choices before them. That said, progress was made, as they changed the next specification, <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-filesystem\">wasi-filesystem</a> to be performant by default, both not requiring dot directories or eager inodes. We're grateful to have been listened to.</p>\n<p>If your performance after initialization time is dominated by this, you may of course file an issue to request a non-strict wasi setting. That said, we'd prefer to not make that setting. We have near term plans, likely this summer, to make the whole filesystem behaviour pluggable. In other words, avoiding this cost will be something you can choose to do on your own later, even for the current WASI specs.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to discuss more on this or anything else, jump on <a href=\"https://gophers.slack.com/\">gophers slack</a> <code>#wazero</code> channel.

(created in #23988) to write to BigQuery\r\n\r\nSome features added and adjusted along the way:\r\n- Added module plugin utilities that help when creating Python-using-Java cross-language tests that use a particular expansion service (ie GCP, kinesis, etc.).\r\n- Using these utilities, two new test-suites are added for Python-using-Java GCP cross-language tests (one for Dataflow, one for Direct).\r\n- Adjusted Python SchemaTransform API for convenience when creating wrappers (continued in #26100)\r\n\r\nFixes #21961\r\nFixes
