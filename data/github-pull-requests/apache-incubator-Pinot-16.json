https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11185 added proper support for null handling. One side effect is that the order of execution was changed, which has performance implications for queries where a bitmap based filter operator can reduce evaluating some expression like `regexp_like` as many times. In summary, `NOT (a AND b)` is executed as `NOT a OR NOT b`.\r\n\r\nFor example, affected queries could look like:\r\n```\r\nNOT (text_match(col, '...') AND regexp_like(col, '...'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the PR changed `NotFilterOperator` to use `AndFilterOperator.getFalses()` which [builds an `OrDocIdSet` from the false DocIdSets](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11185/files#diff-13077035b35ccc6f9b73625c2315d9571a80fd9fedcec2d75f689f9b335e22aaR59-R68) instead of using a `NotDocIdIterator` built from the `AndDocIdSet` as was done in the old implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes implementation back to the first, except also handles nulls properly. \r\n\r\ntags: `bugfix`

is a `feature` to allow\r\n1. an API call to reset adaptive routing stats for 1 instance or all instances\r\n2. add a config to automatically reset server stats for a new instance\r\n\r\nThis is a response to an issue we had a few months ago where adaptive routing was sending an outsized number of queries to 2 replicas out of 3 we had configured. Restarting the brokers fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nAdding the API feels non-controversial, and we've added this to our incident playbooks as a potential remediation when we see skewed routing.\r\n\r\nWhile we've tested the configuration to automatically reset server stats, we have not enabled it by default. It's not immediately clear if this is more valuable than just relying on autodecay, but as far as I can tell, if a server is removed and re-added, there's really no reason to keep the previous stats around as they will be invalid.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it has been impossible to replicate the original incident, so we've mostly observed metrics in steady state or under synthetic load.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-21T16:51:33Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T17:17:19Z","closed_at":"2024-05-23T17:17:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"097d5b3d71f8818c87af2ae90c3d9dc1501495f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vvivekiyer","id":21298365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4MzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer","html_url":"https://github.com/vvivekiyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1391055164,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzkxMDU1MTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"0055f4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/pulls/13196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/pulls/13196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/statuses/4ff58fcc09e4dde6a1b0dd5ebd93bd8a7c960407","head":{"label":"jadami10:jadami/oss-adaptive-routing-stats-clear","ref":"jadami/oss-adaptive-routing-stats-clear","sha":"4ff58fcc09e4dde6a1b0dd5ebd93bd8a7c960407","user":{"login":"jadami10","id":4760722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjA3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4760722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10","html_url":"https://github.com/jadami10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"34a1fb71f4d2e822c8a90948d32170289388744d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19961085,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTk2MTA4NQ==","name":"pinot","full_name":"apache/pinot","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.co

This patch adds a backward compatibility regression test suite for the multi-stage query engine. It uses the framework added in https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6129, https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6650, https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4001 and extends it to use the multi-stage query engine with queries like joins, windows, and set operations.\r\n- We're using a separate new test suite for now because we only want to run the multi-stage query engine backward compatibility tests against `master` whereas the existing tests currently run against `release-1.0.0`, `release-1.1.0` and `master`.\r\n- We can't currently run these multi-stage query engine backward compatibility tests against older releases because there are already known breakages in backward compatibility between these releases. Going forward, however, we want to maintain backward compatibility in the multi-stage query engine as well, which is why these tests are being added.\r\n- Future releases `release-1.2.0` , `release-1.3.0` etc. will be added to the list of branches that the multi-stage query engine backward compatibility tests are run against.\r\n- These new tests use the existing framework for backward compatibility regression tests and hence run tests with these scenarios using a single controller, broker, and server setup:\r\n\t- Controller on older version, Broker on older version, Server on older version\r\n\t- Controller on newer version, Broker on older version, Server on older version\r\n\t- Controller on newer version, Broker on newer version, Server on older version\r\n\t- Controller on newer version, Broker on newer version, Server on newer version\r\n- Ideally, for the multi-stage query engine, we'd want to test for multi-server scenarios as well (where different servers are running different versions). Support for this will be added in a future patch. The current tests help catch compatibility issues between Broker <-> Server interactions.\r\n- Note that a new GitHub Actions workflow file has been created for the multi-stage query engine compatibility regression tests since currently we don't want to run it against older versions whereas we'd still want to run the regular compatibility regression test suite against older versions (for instance, during releases).\r\n- Once we reach a state where we have multiple released versions where backward compatibility has been maintained for the multi-stage query engine, we can merge the two compatibility regression test suites and run them against the same versions.\r\n- Suggested labels:

value order, key:value or value:key, this makes difference once Lucene builds index.\r\n- Allow __mergedTextIndex to store text in case insensitive way, this would benefits search by converting regex to wildcard in query parser.\r\n- Allow to drop some field from json_data, this is useful if we want to build index on some input field but not intend to store it.\r\n- Slight improvement (dfs pruning) for schema transforming algorighm \r\n- Add more comprehensive schema validation check\r\n- Bugfix and improvement for string multi-value - single-value cast and serialization.\r\n- Bugfix for SchemaConformingTransformerV2Config getter setter.\r\n- Update UT accordingly\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility\r\n\r\n- All changed configs are with default value which is same as

like:\r\n```sql\r\nWITH CTE_B AS (\r\n  SELECT 1 AS __ts FROM a GROUP BY __ts\r\n) \r\nSELECT 1 \r\nFROM CTE_B \r\nWHERE __ts >= 1 AND __ts < 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nFail when they are executed. The reason is that very tricky, but mostly is due to:\r\n- Our rules are not able to get rid of the tautology (`1 >= 1 and 1 < 2` is always true), so it is pushed into the leaf stage\r\n- The leaf stage generates an equivalent V1 query, but does not apply `CompileTimeFunctionsInvoker`, so these tautologies are not removed from the expression tree\r\n- V1 row-by-row engine doesn't know how to execute these tautologies because it only expects expressions like `col1 > doubleLiteral`.\r\n\r\nThese tautologies are generated in `PinotFilterExpandSearchRule`. We have two rules that should ideally remove them:\r\n- `PinotEvaluateLiteralRule` (which evaluates the expressions using V1 semantics)\r\n- `CoreRules.FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` (which evalautes the expressions using Calcite semantics)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we should be able to call `CompileTimeFunctionsInvoker` rewriter in the leaf stage. This invoker is also using V1 semantics.\r\n\r\nBut any of these changes works.\r\n1. `PinotEvaluateLiteralRule` and `CompileTimeFunctionsInvoker` partially work because V1 can execute `=` assuming each operand is a number. Things like `1=1` or `'123'='123'` but cannot execute `'a' = 'a'`.\r\n2. `CoreRules.FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` can get rid of the tautologies, but in some scenarios it creates just another `SEARCH` operation. V1 cannot execute them.\r\n\r\nI'm not proud of the solution found in this PR. It basically consist of applying the pair `PinotFilterExpandSearchRule`, `CoreRules.FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` twice.  Although it seems to be working in all cases I tried, I'm sure there will be cases were this solution is not good enough.\r\n\r\nIMO it would be better to:\r\n1. Have a centralized function register, as suggested by @walterddr long ago.\r\n2. Support `search` in V1.\r\n\r\nDo you have other ideas on how to fix this problem?\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-17T14:49:26Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T12:52:51Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mayankshriv","id":12615885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE1ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12615885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankshriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/pulls/13174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/pulls/13174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/statuses/a163afdd0affb35c02751f3bd99fcf7fad97135f","head":{"label":"gortiz:fix-search-tautologies","ref":"fix-search-tautologies","sha":"a163afdd0affb35c02751f3bd99fcf7fad97135f","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":490601958,"node_id":"R_kgDOHT395g","name":"pinot","full_name":"gortiz/pinot","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz/pinot","description":"Apache

https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/13151 added support for `INTERSECT ALL` and `EXCEPT ALL` set operators in the multi-stage query engine.\r\n- The logical plan for queries using these operators does contain whether or not the `ALL` modifier was used.\r\n- For instance, the output for `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM A) EXCEPT ALL (SELECT b FROM B);` looks like this (Calcite syntax):\r\n```\r\nLogicalMinus(all=[true])\r\n  PinotLogicalExchange(distribution=[hash[0]])\r\n    LogicalProject(a=[$3])\r\n      LogicalTableScan(table=[[default, A]])\r\n  PinotLogicalExchange(distribution=[hash[0]])\r\n    LogicalProject(b=[$3])\r\n      LogicalTableScan(table=[[default, B]])\r\n```\r\n- The physical plan for queries, however, currently doesn't include whether or not the `ALL` modifier was used. So the output for both `EXPLAIN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM A) EXCEPT ALL (SELECT b FROM B);` and `EXPLAIN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM A) EXCEPT (SELECT b FROM B);` would look the same:\r\n```\r\n[0]@192.168.29.25:64480|[0] MAIL_RECEIVE(BROADCAST_DISTRIBUTED)\r\n└── [1]@192.168.29.25:64487|[0] MAIL_SEND(BROADCAST_DISTRIBUTED)->{[0]@192.168.29.25:64480|[0]}\r\n    └── [1]@192.168.29.25:64487|[0] MINUS\r\n        └── [1]@192.168.29.25:64487|[0] MAIL_RECEIVE(HASH_DISTRIBUTED)\r\n        └── [1]@192.168.29.25:64487|[0] MAIL_RECEIVE(HASH_DISTRIBUTED)\r\n```\r\n- This PR fixes the issue by updating `SetOpNode::explain` which is called in the `PhysicalExplainPlanVisitor` [here](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/0f48825d2d36e489c743d7e50bdb62bfc1f786ba/pinot-query-planner/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/query/planner/explain/PhysicalExplainPlanVisitor.java#L120). The output for `EXPLAIN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM A) EXCEPT ALL (SELECT b FROM B);` now looks like:\r\n```\r\n[0]@192.168.29.25:64480|[0]

PR contains two changes: \r\n1. Add instrumentation for OOM protection to json index's getMatchingFlattenedDocsMap()\r\n2. Use lazy initialization when generating the map in `json_extract_index` transform function\r\n\r\nFor the first change, we've seen the map can be very large and sampling/interruption check previously could not occur during map generation. \r\n\r\nFor the second, lazy initialization skips map generation entirely when filters exclude all results which can save significant resources depending on the query. \r\n\r\nUTs cover the logic, but also deployed in our prod instances and we do not see heap saturation from `json_extract_index` queries anymore. \r\n\r\ntags:  `enhancement` `performance` (?)

we found that post-compaction, string fields with length greater than default 512 characters got trimmed. On debugging, I found that we were using schema generated from `metadata.properties` file and not passing schema from ZK to SegmentGenerator class. This hotfix is related to passing ZK schema to this.\r\n\r\nOne of the other root-causes is `metadata.properties` file missing schema max length information for columns. Also while creating fieldSpec from metadata properties we don't pass maxlength anywhere -- https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/0f48825d2d36e489c743d7e50bdb62bfc1f786ba/pinot-segment-spi/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/segment/spi/index/metadata/ColumnMetadataImpl.java#L236\r\nThis leads to falling back to default 512 for string fields.\r\n\r\nSample metadata.properties values for a column:\r\n```\r\ncolumn.Attr.cardinality = -2147483648\r\ncolumn.Attr.totalDocs = 1322868\r\ncolumn.Attr.dataType = STRING\r\ncolumn.Attr.bitsPerElement = 31\r\ncolumn.Attr.lengthOfEachEntry = 0\r\ncolumn.Attr.columnType = DIMENSION\r\ncolumn.Attr.isSorted = false\r\ncolumn.Attr.hasDictionary = false\r\ncolumn.Attr.isSingleValues = true\r\ncolumn.Attr.maxNumberOfMultiValues = 0\r\ncolumn.Attr.totalNumberOfEntries = 1322868\r\ncolumn.Attr.isAutoGenerated = false\r\ncolumn.Attr.minValue = null\r\ncolumn.Attr.minMaxValueInvalid = true\r\ncolumn.Attr.defaultNullValue = null\r\n```\r\nNo schemaMaxLength field present here^^. \r\n\r\nLonger term fix I am planning as a follow-up is to persist maxLength info in metadata properties file and parsing that in the ColumnMetadataImpl file while creating FieldSpec.\r\n\r\ncc @snleee @Jackie-Jiang

This is a fix for https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13155\r\n- Support for dynamic log configuration APIs was added in https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9180 and documented in https://github.com/pinot-contrib/pinot-docs/pull/132\r\n- Currently, these APIs don't allow modifying the level of loggers that aren't explicitly configured.\r\n- For instance, let's say that a Pinot controller process is started with the log4j configuration file containing log levels defined for the following loggers: `root`, `org.apache.pinot.tools.admin` and `org.reflections` (see [this log4j config file](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/0f48825d2d36e489c743d7e50bdb62bfc1f786ba/pinot-tools/src/main/resources/conf/log4j2.xml#L41-L48) for reference).\r\n- Now, if we attempt to change the log level of the `org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.core.realtime.SegmentCompletionManager` class via `PUT /loggers/org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.core.realtime.SegmentCompletionManager?level=DEBUG`, this returns the following response: `{\"code\":500,\"error\":\"Logger - org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.core.realtime.SegmentCompletionManager not found\"}`\r\n- This is because the check [here](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/0f48825d2d36e489c743d7e50bdb62bfc1f786ba/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/utils/LoggerUtils.java#L55) only checks whether the logger name is in the list of loggers that are already explicitly configured.\r\n- This severely limits the usefulness of the dynamic log configuration API as it prevents the modification of all loggers that aren't explicitly configured in the log4j configuration file.\r\n- This patch allows dynamically setting the log level even for loggers that aren't already explicitly configured. ~~In a future enhancement, we could also allow dynamically setting the log level for an ancestor logger which would affect all the descendant loggers (see https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/architecture.html#logger-hierarchy)~~.\r\n- This also allows dynamically configuring the log level for ancestor / parent loggers - for instance, `org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.core`. This will then also affect the log level for all the descendant / child loggers - for instance, `org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.core.realtime.SegmentCompletionManager` (see https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/architecture.html#logger-hierarchy).\r\n- Suggested label: `bugfix` or

This is a fix for https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13126 and https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13127\r\n- The `SetOperator` has been modified slightly to use a multiset instead of a regular set so that we can support the `INTERSECT ALL` and `EXCEPT ALL` set operations.\r\n- Alternatively, we could've extended the `SetOperator` class with a `MultisetOperator` class with the appropriate abstractions but since the hash multiset overhead isn't too high (essentially just an additional count maintained per element), this option was avoided in favor of the cleaner, uniform implementation.\r\n- Suggested labels - either `feature` or `bugfix` since the `INTERSECT ALL`, `EXCEPT ALL` set operations currently erroneously return the same results as `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT` respectively.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nLet's take an example to demonstrate the various set operation semantics and their differences. Suppose there's two tables `A` (with one column `'a'`) and `B` (with one column `'b'`) with the following rows:\r\n\r\n<h3>A</h3>\r\n\r\n```\r\na\r\n--\r\n1\r\n2\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\n<h3>B</h3>\r\n\r\n```\r\nb\r\n--\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, `SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM A) INTERSECT (SELECT b FROM B)` should return:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\n`SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM A) INTERSECT ALL (SELECT b FROM B)` should return:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\n`SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM A) EXCEPT (SELECT b FROM B)` should return:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nand, `SELECT * FROM (SELECT a FROM A) EXCEPT ALL (SELECT b FROM B)` should return:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n```","created_at":"2024-05-14T09:59:10Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T15:54:17Z","closed_at":"2024-05-16T07:16:08Z","merged_at":"2024-05-16T07:16:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"892ab7f528340c5303e9ca7fe881816991ff7a9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3912550769,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATCU_c7pNMlx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"9423A4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4436248369,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATCU_c8AAAABCGvHMQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/labels/multi-stage","name":"multi-stage","color":"676ED3","default":false,"description":"Related

Non-constant string concatenations are evaluated at runtime even when the actual log message isn't emitted and this has a non-zero performance impact.\r\n- Using parameterized log messages helps avoid this issue since the string evaluation will only occur if the logger is enabled.\r\n- While this change is particularly impactful for `debug` and `trace` log messages since the default log level is `info`, we should ideally use parameterized log messages instead of string concatenation for all log levels since log levels for loggers can be adjusted, and parameterized log messages are considered best practice.\r\n- This patch doesn't modify log messages that are inside a log level check if block

The JSON index currently doesn't support nested (within `AND` / `OR`) exclusive predicates (`NOT IN`, `!=`, `IS NULL`) with the `JSON_MATCH` filter operator.\r\n- The reason for this is the existing semantics for exclusive predicates that are inconsistent and confusing.\r\n- A document like:\r\n  - ```\r\n     [\r\n       {\r\n         \"key1\": \"value1\",\r\n         \"key2\": 1\r\n       },\r\n       {\r\n         \"key1\": \"value2\",\r\n         \"key2\": 2\r\n       }\r\n     ]\r\n    ```\r\n    matches `\"$[*].key2\" = 1`, but not `\"$[*].key2\" != 2` for example.\r\n- Essentially, the wildcard array access for inclusive predicates means that we match the array when ANY value matches, but for exclusive predicates, we match the array when ALL values match.\r\n- Furthermore, a document like:\r\n  - ```\r\n     [\r\n       {\r\n          \"key1\": \"value1\",\r\n       }\r\n     ]\r\n    ```\r\n    matches `\"$[0].key2\" != 2` which is counterintuitive since the object doesn’t contain `key2` at all.\r\n- The reason for both of these inconsistencies and confusing semantics is the way that exclusive predicates are implemented. Exclusive predicates are currently handled by finding the [flattened doc ID](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/json-index#example)s of the corresponding inclusive predicate, mapping them back to the corresponding unflattened doc IDs, and then inverting / flipping the resultant bitmap. And that is also the reason why nested exclusive predicates aren’t supported currently since the intermediate flattened doc ID results can’t be combined with flattened doc ID results from other child predicates while maintaining the same semantics.\r\n- This patch fixes the above inconsistencies so that `[*]` now means the same for both exclusive (`NOT IN`, `!=`) and inclusive predicates, and documents where a key doesn't exist aren't matched for the exclusive predicates `NOT IN`, `!=`. It also adds support for nested exclusive predicates.\r\n- The new implementation for `NOT IN`, `!=` make use of similar logic to the implementation for the regex and range predicates (https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12568).\r\n- Essentially, we first get all the values for a corresponding key. Then, we iterate through the values - and for each value that matches the predicate, we add the list of corresponding flattened doc IDs to the result.\r\n- The `IS NULL` predicate continues to remain an \"exclusive\" predicate and won't be supported for use in nested predicates as of now, because there isn't a straightforward way to efficiently treat it as an inclusive predicate (i.e., without scanning all the flattened docs). We can't simply flip the flattened doc ID result for the corresponding `IS NOT NULL` predicate either as that leads to incorrect results when `disableCrossArrayUnnest` is set to `true`, as well as certain other scenarios involving chained array accesses and wildcard accesses.\r\n- Suggested labels: `feature`, `backward-incompat`, `release-notes`\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-13T07:08:58Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T05:02:06Z","closed_at":"2024-05-17T05:01:36Z","merged_at":"2024-05-17T05:01:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"2015d6e82623254f8d17aef36b6a2d790f922113","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":100789442,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDA3ODk0NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null},{"id":1391055164,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzkxMDU1MTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"0055f4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1391058505,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzkxMDU4NTA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"8281ea","default":true,"description":""},{"id":2041861760,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQxODYxNzYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/labels/release-notes","name":"release-notes","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"Referenced

per the [issue](https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13047) and other [issue](https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/5306), we are getting `java.lang.NoSuchMethodException` warning messages while loading the swagger endpoints using jersey2. This same issue is discussed here in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49875277/swagger-hk2-service-reification-failed). For the solution; we are taking the same approach as mentioned in StackOverflow with some changes. \r\n\r\nHere are the changes \r\n- Introduced the new `SwaggerApiListingResource` class with ServletConfig as a class member. Jersey-hk2 is not trying to inject the class; hence, there is no reification warning. This new class will be used instead of the default `io.swagger.jaxrs.listing.ApiListingResource` to load the swagger response.\r\n- Refactored the swagger bean config creation part. Pinot almost has a similar bean creation code in five different classes. Consolidate the code into one util class and use it.\r\n- Added the minion swagger-ui test in `AdminConsoleIntegrationTest`\r\n\r\ncc: @Jackie-Jiang

We added support for generating raw derived columns during segment reload recently in https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/13037.\r\n- An

wrapper classes to primitive arrays.\r\n- This patch adds the optimization and also adds derived numeric MV columns to the existing integration test for segment reload so that these additional code paths are covered (they previously had no test coverage).\r\n- Note that we can't simply use primitive arrays unconditionally because the [dictionary

`release-notes`\r\n\r\nDelivers: https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/12987, https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10896\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThis change will allow users to specify the partitionId for an externally generated segment as part of segment metadata. This enables support for backfilling/bootstrapping an upsert realtime table with externally generated segments:\r\n1. where the upstream (e.g. Kafka) is partitioned based on an algorithm(custom) not supported in Pinot via `PartitionFunctionType` (Modulo, Murmur, Murmur3, ByteArray, HashCode, BoundedColumnValue)\r\n2. If the partitioning is done on a column not indexed in the table. e.g. upstream defines a compound PK and partitions on concatenated PK value and writes to stream but does not propagate the concatenated PK, so a single column can not be defined in table config for partitioning.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n**Why should the data be partitioned**\r\nUpsert table requires the upstream data to be partitioned so data of a primary key is in a single partition. This ensures each host responsible for PK --> recordLocation has all the rows of PKs upserted in a single host and ensures unique row per PK.\r\n\r\n**How does realtime ingestion handle partitions**\r\nThe stream ingesting to Pinot should already be parittioned externally. Pinot generates partitions to instnace mapping and persists in ZK. Each server instance responsible for partition will consume from the stream partition and generate realtime segments named using convention, `<tablename>__<partitionId>__<seqId>__<createTS>`. This naming convention helps to identify segment partitions when needed for various operations, e.g. recomputing segment assignment during rebalance. Pinot essentially is agnostic of any partitioning done in the upstream.(ref: [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qljEMndPMxbbKtjlVn9mn2toz7Qrk0TGQsHLfI--7h8/edit#heading=h.lsfmyoyyxtgt))\r\n\r\n**Upsert table backfill support**\r\nA prevoiusly implementation enhanced the architecture to allow uploading batch generated segments to Upsert tables (ref: [design doc](umetric-dca-cluster-dca-titih-mataj)). It provides support to generate a segment using offline data and identifies such segments with `Segment.Status = UPLOADED`\r\nPartition infromation in an uploaded segment is captured by utlising column partitioning config which is primarily used for query routing optimisation([pinot docs](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/operating-pinot/tuning/routing#data-ingested-partitioned-by-some-column)).\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\nSimilar to realtime ingestion, the way streams provide partitionId, uploaded segments should provide the partition they belong to. Changes part of the PR:\r\n1. New segment naming convention for segments being uploaded to upsert table with partition id and sequence id encoded in name `UploadedRealtimeSegmentName`. Similar to LLCSegmentName.\r\n2. Use partitionId in the UploadedRealtimeSegmentName to assign segment to instance\r\n3. For comparison tie during `addOrReplaceSegment()`. Resolve comparison value tie based on below logic. Currently this is missing and replace is inconsistent if an upsert table has LLCSegment and batch generated segments.\r\n    a. When the replacing segment and current segment are of {@link LLCSegmentName} then the PK should resolve to row in segment with higher sequence id.\r\n    b. When the replacing segment and current segment are of {@link UploadedRealtimeSegmentName} then the PK should resolve to row in segment with higher sequence id, creation time.\r\n    c. When either is of type {@link UploadedRealtimeSegmentName} then resolve on creation time, if same(rare scenario) then give preference to uploaded time\r\n4. Augment `SegmentUtils.getRealtimeSegmentPartitionId()` to assign an uploaded realtime segment correctly.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n1. Add field `_uploadedSegmentPartitionId` to `SegmentGeneratorConfig` class to provide external partition id for segment generation. If not set defaults to -1 and is used to infer segment name generation property if not provided.\r\n2. New segment name generator `UploadedRealtimeSegmentNameGenerator`\r\n3. Update `getRealtimeSegmentPartitionId()` to parse uploaded segment partitionId from segment name.\r\n4. SegmentGeneratorConfig defines `_uploadedSegmentPartitionId` to infer generator for UploadedRealtimeSegmentName and generate segments with provided partitionId\r\n\r\n**Note**: The uploaded segment naming convention is decided as `{prefix}__{tableName}__{partitionId}__{creationTime}__{suffix}`. This ensures, similar naming as LLCSegmentName, removes need to do ZK lookup in various critical paths, prefix and suffix are mandatory which help in differentiating LLCSegmentName(3 separators) and UplaodedRealtimeSegmentName(4 separators). The prefix can be used to encode info like source/type of segment interpretable for external workload(e.g. spark/flink/minion) and suffix can be used to do name conflict resolution e.g encoding sequenceId.\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\n1. Use LLCSegmentName for offline generated segments to upload:\r\n    There are several assumptions with LLCSegmentName(did not exhaustively check). But one basic one is this when we try to load a segment named as a LLCSegmentName.\r\n    ```\r\n    Got invalid segment metadata when adding segment: testtable_REALTIME__0__0__19700101T0000Z for table: testtable_REALTIME, reason: New uploaded LLC segment must have start/end offset in the segment metadata\r\n    ```\r\n    `PinotLLCRealtimeSegmentManager#ensureAllPartitionsConsuming()` also assumes LLCSegmentNames are all realtime generated segments and tries to create consuming segment.\r\n    Modifying the current assumptions on LLCSegment could be more complex to manage an uploaded segment.\r\n2. Extend segment metadata to capture uploaded segments partitionId, persist in ZK.\r\n    a. Increases calls to ZK for getting partitionId.\r\n6. [Implemented] Naming scheme for uploaded segment e.g table_name_{starttime}_{endtime}_{partitionId}_{seqId}\r\n    This has a similar implementation effort but introduces implicit logic to handle uploaded segments. Currently offline generated segments are not restricted to any naming convention and users can handle segment name clashes if any themselves.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n# Testing plan\r\n1. Unit tests\r\n8. Functional tests:\r\n    **Plan**:\r\n    a. Use upsertMeetupRsvp example table to backfill\r\n    b. Generate a segment with CreateSegmentCommand with below config, segmentName = `spark__upsertMeetupRsvp__1__1717701199455__3`\r\n    ```\r\n    ....\r\n    segmentGeneratorConfig.setUploadedSegmentPartitionId(uploadedSegmentPartitionId);\r\n    segmentGeneratorConfig.setSegmentNamePrefix(\"spark\");\r\n    segmentGeneratorConfig.setSequenceId(3);\r\n    ```\r\n    c. Upload segment using: `localhost:9001/segments?tableName=upsertMeetupRsvp&tableType=REALTIME&enableParallelPushProtection=false&allowRefresh=false`\r\n    **Observations**\r\n    a.

2 fixes\r\n\r\n**1. Adaptive Server Selection - race condition:**\r\n\r\nA race condition between jetty threads and netty threads can result in setting negative values for numInFlightRequests for servers. This can result in that particular server being overloaded when compared to other. \r\n\r\nIt's difficult to reproduce this but the race-condition is obvious from code-reading. \r\n\r\nThe race condition is explained below\r\nLet's say a query is routed to 2 servers S1 and S2. Say the query has a timeout of 1s. The race condition timeline is as follows: \r\nT1: Query is routed to S1 and S2. The ADSS stats will look as follows:\r\n`S1 Stats = {\r\n  numInFlightRequests = 1\r\n}\r\nS2 Stats = {\r\n  numInFlightRequests = 1\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nT2: S1 responds with the results (dataTable). The ADSS stats [will be updated ](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/70bfd4185ca18eb64658c5a35813e3578f7c843d/pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/transport/AsyncQueryResponse.java#L158) to look as follows. Note that this update is by the netty thread that receives the response. \r\n`S1 Stats = {\r\n  numInFlightRequests = 0\r\n}\r\nS2 Stats = {\r\n  numInFlightRequests = 1\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nT3: Let's say the query timed out. The jetty thread will update the ADSS stats for S2 as per [code](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/70bfd4185ca18eb64658c5a35813e3578f7c843d/pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/transport/AsyncQueryResponse.java#L97) to look as follows:\r\n`S1 Stats = {\r\n  numInFlightRequests = 0\r\n}\r\nS2 Stats = {\r\n  numInFlightRequests = 0\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nT4: Before the [jetty thread removes the QueryResponse object ](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/70bfd4185ca18eb64658c5a35813e3578f7c843d/pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/transport/AsyncQueryResponse.java#L102)for the request, the server S2 could respond and the corresponding netty thread would update the ADSS stats incorrectly to look as follows \r\n`S1 Stats = {\r\n  numInFlightRequests = 0\r\n}\r\nS2 Stats = {\r\n  numInFlightRequests = -1\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Updates client error list to add a few more exceptions.**

At present, SanitizationTransformer just trims the string length based on configured schema max length. The process is very silent with no observability if the field got trimmed or an option to skip rather than trimming. This becomes critical if the field even if string is treated for json-indexing as post-trimming it can lead to trimmed json / malformed json eventually stopping ingestion.\r\n- Here, we add a new table-schema config in FieldSpec `maxLengthExceedStrategy`. Default value is to TRIM_LENGTH to ensure backward compatibility. If configured to be `ERROR`, in case of incoming-string-value exceeding the configured max length, it will skip the record, return error and log accordingly. If set as `SUBSTITUTE_DEFAULT_VALUE`, it will substitute the configured default value in place of the huge string. There is another strategy as `NO_ACTION` which justs ingests the string.\r\n- We have extended similar functionality to JSON and BYTES column type with default being NO_ACTION to preserve backward incompatibility.\r\n\r\nSample FieldSpec:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n        \"name\": \"Attr\",\r\n        \"dataType\": \"STRING\",\r\n        \"maxLength\": 10000,\r\n        \"maxLengthExceedStrategy\":

The [JSON_FORMAT function](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/070e3dbd81f8223e5ad3872a3b8ae15db87bc543/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/function/scalar/JsonFunctions.java#L82) currently just calls [JsonUtils::objectToString](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/070e3dbd81f8223e5ad3872a3b8ae15db87bc543/pinot-spi/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/spi/utils/JsonUtils.java#L239) which in turn calls Jackson Databind's [ObjectMapper::writeValueAsStringMethod](https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.9/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.html#writeValueAsString-java.lang.Object-).\r\n- If a JSON object that has already been formatted is passed to this function, the string is \"re-stringified\" and the result is an escaped string.\r\n- For instance, taking the JSON object `{\"data\":{\"alias\":\"student1\",\"age\":24,\"name\":{\"full.name\":\"Peter1\",\"nick.name\":\"Pete1\"}}}`. Calling the `JSON_FORMAT` function on this will result in the string value `{\"data\":{\"alias\":\"student1\",\"age\":24,\"name\":{\"full.name\":\"Peter1\",\"nick.name\":\"Pete1\"}}}`.\r\n- Calling the `JSON_FORMAT` function again on this string value will result in the escaped string - `\"{\\\"data\\\":{\\\"alias\\\":\\\"student1\\\",\\\"age\\\":24,\\\"name\\\":{\\\"full.name\\\":\\\"Peter1\\\",\\\"nick.name\\\":\\\"Pete1\\\"}}}\"`. Passing it through the function again will result in a doubly escaped string - `\"\\\"{\\\\\\\"data\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"alias\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"student1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"age\\\\\\\":24,\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"full.name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Peter1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"nick.name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Pete1\\\\\\\"}}}\\\"\"`.\r\n- This can lead to unexpected results in certain scenarios. For instance, let's say that we have a table with a `data` JSON column with the row - `{\"data\":{\"alias\":\"student1\",\"age\":24,\"name\":{\"full.name\":\"Peter1\",\"nick.name\":\"Pete1\"}}}`.\r\n- Now suppose we want to add a new derived column `alias` using the ingestion transform function `JSON_PATH_STRING(JSON_FORMAT(data), '$.alias')` (via segment reload). Since JSON columns are stored as strings internally, calling `JSON_FORMAT` on its values will lead to escaped strings. This leads to an NPE [here](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/070e3dbd81f8223e5ad3872a3b8ae15db87bc543/pinot-segment-local/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/segment/local/segment/index/loader/defaultcolumn/BaseDefaultColumnHandler.java#L592) because the `JSON_PATH_STRING` function returns a `null` as it will treat the escaped string argument as a literal JSON string value. This minor patch fixes this issue by avoiding re-stringifying strings in `JsonUtils::objectToString`.\r\n- Note that the above behavior is especially confusing because if the ingestion transform function was added during table creation itself, ingestion goes through fine because the argument passed to the `JSON_FORMAT` function in this case would be the raw `HashMap` that hasn't been converted to a string yet.\r\n-

patch validates whether the configured minionInstanceTag actually exists in the list of instance-tags or not. Before this, if a wrong instanceTag was configured for a task, Pinot scheduled those tasks and they got stuck in `IN_PROGRESS` state. Until the task is timed out, no another task scheduling for that table and task type was possible. Or you need to update some minion instance with the specified instanceTag. Ideally, we should error out by throwing an exception for instanceTag not found which this patch achieves.\r\n\r\nThere is a more proactive way of doing this at table-config updation itself. We will try to achieve that when we introduce `minionTenant` config
