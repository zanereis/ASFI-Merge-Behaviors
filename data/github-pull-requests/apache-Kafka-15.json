there were no unit tests in the `transaction-coordinator` module, which made it easy to introduce errors when modifying the code.\r\nThere are only two files in the module: `TransactionLogConfig` and `TransactionStateManagerConfig`\r\nIn the `TransactionLogConfig`, there are some fields are dynamic, which means we need to make sure all values are directly get from Abstract config so that if [KafkaConfig update its config](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/9b62c861fa4650e58a393384ed16dcec9df32fc5/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaConfig.scala#L190-L196), the program can get latest value.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n* Add UT to make sure all declared config are defined in `CONFIG_DEF`\r\n* Add UT to make sure static config are retrieve from class attribute and dynamic values are retrieved from `AbstractConfig` \r\n* Rename `transactionsLoadBufferSize` to `transactionLoadBufferSize`\r\n  * Just align the other variables, as none of them have an 's'. Having only one variable missing the 's' is error-prone. The other option is to add an 's' to all the other variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-10T08:33:11Z","updated_at":"2024-10-13T10:43:39Z","closed_at":"2024-10-12T01:42:54Z","merged_at":"2024-10-12T01:42:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"d74f1f847a42ffb3013eba68a275da03b970f175","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17696\r\n\r\nWhen API calls that handle background events (e.g., poll, unsubscribe, close) encounter errors, the errors are only passed to the application thread via ErrorEvent.\r\nOther API calls that do not process background events (e.g., position) are not notified of these errors, meaning that issues like unauthorized access to topics will go unnoticed by those operations.\r\nBackground operations are not aborted or notified when a metadata error occurs, such as an Unauthorized error, which can lead to situations where a call like position keeps waiting for an update, despite the Unauthorized error already happening.\r\n\r\nDue to the blocking issue in `applicationEventHandler.addAndGet(checkAndUpdatePositionsEvent);`, I consider that

issue of 'this' escape in the `BrokerTopicMetrics` class was caused by the `GaugeWrapper` class, which is a inner class and held an inherited reference to `this` from `BrokerTopicMetrics`. The `BrokerTopicMetrics` constructor invoked the creation of a new `GaugeWrapper`, resulting in the unsafe exposure of `this` during construction.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves the issue by changing the `GaugeWrapper` class to be a `static` class, thus removing the implicit reference to the outer `BrokerTopicMetrics` instance.\r\n\r\nTested by rebuilding the project with Java 23\r\n\r\n### Committer

\r\n\r\n1. Declare the delayed share fetch purgatory inside ReplicaManager along with the existing purgatories. We don't need a reference to this purgatory outside of ReplicaManager, we can just add accessor methods.\r\n2. Currently, we check the produce/fetch purgatory when a replica becomes the follower or a replica is deleted from a broker through ReplicaManager. applyLocalFollowersDelta and ReplicaManager.applyDelta. We should do the same for share purgatory.\r\n3. Perform a checkAndComplete when HWM is updated\r\n4. Perform a shutdown of the delayed share fetch purgatory like the others in

introduced a change to send UpdateVoterRequest every `3 * fetchTimeoutMs`. It also introduced a regression where if the voter nodes do not need an update then `updateVoterTimer` wasn't reset. This resulted in a busy-loop in the KraftClient's `poll()` method resulting in high CPU usage.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the conditions in `pollFollowerAsVoter` to reset `updateVoterTimer`

creation of internal topics for KIP-1071.\r\n\r\nWhen initializing the topology, the client sends information about the internal topics required for the application. The key concept is that the topology description being sent to the broker is parametric in the number of partitions -- that is, the broker checks the number of partitions for the input partition, and derives the number of partitions for the internal topic. This logic is ported from the existing streams partition assignor.\r\n\r\nThe basic flow is that, upon receiving the initialize RPC, the group coordinator checks for the right ACL permissions, validates if the request is valid, then updates the topology record in the consumer offset topic, determines the right number of partitions for all internal topics and finally triggers a corresponding CreateTopic request.\r\n\r\nCode for generating and validating internal topic configuration lives inside the group coordinator, but the actual creation of the topics is performed from within KafkaApis.\r\n\r\nThere is a dependency between updating the topology record in the consumer offset topic and creating the internal topics. In case of failures, one could be executed without the other. In this implementation, we update the topology record first, and then create internal topics. The topology record will be the single source of truth. If internal topic creation fails, we need to detect this inside the client. Right now, the heartbeat will respond with error if internal topics are missing. Once we merge the heartbeat and the initialization RPC, we should get the behavior that any attempt to join the group (with a topology description) will also be an attempt to create any missing internal topics.\r\n\r\nLike existing RPCs (TopicMetadata and FindCoordinator), we auto-create topics asynchronously — so a create topic request is started, but the result is not immediately checked. I created a separate ticket to expose any errors occurring during the topic creation to the user - right now, they will only show up in the broker logs.\r\n\r\nWe need some extra logic for revalidating internal topics. With this change, the set of tasks is defined by the TopicsImage in the group coordinator and the partition-parametric topology description. The group epoch needs to be bumped when either changes, we need to make sure to cache the result of validating and instantiating a topology against a current set of input topics, so that we don’t have to redo it on every heartbeat. After fail-over, we need to reconstruct this cache from the topology and subscription records in the offset topic. I created a separate ticket for internal topic revalidation.","created_at":"2024-10-09T15:13:57Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T13:37:59Z","closed_at":"2024-10-29T13:37:57Z","merged_at":"2024-10-29T13:37:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"4130f2f927060716d05f7629e7e20143436e481c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

Kafka Consumer is being closed then sometimes the wait goes for 30 secs as last telemetry push request doesn't get complete.\r\n\r\nThe issue can only be reproduced when consumer is closed just after creating i.e. instantiated Kafka Consumer and closed it. When consumer is instantly closed then, then worker thread goes for timed_waiting state and expects last telemetry push request, which gets completed by background thread poll. But as the consumer is instantly closed, the heartbeat thread can't send the telemetry request, which makes the consumer close to wait for timeout.\r\n\r\nThe PR addresses the concern by removing the timed waiting signal altogether and just update the state to `TERMINATING_PUSH_NEEDED`. If client triggers the next `poll` then the request will be sent else skipped. The last telemetry push request is good to have.\r\n\r\nThe PR also moved the code for telemetry `initialize close` in Kafka Producer prior to `other` close. Otherwise reporters were closed prior call to `initialize close` of client telemetry reporter.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

patch includes changes to the clients end transaction response handling when transaction version 2 is enabled.\r\nVersion 5+ of the End Txn Response includes the producer Id and the producer epoch fields.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the request, the client updates its producer Id and epoch according to the response.\r\n\r\nOn receiving an EndTxnRequest the server would've either:\r\n1) Bumped the epoch for the given producer ID.\r\n2) On epoch overflow, sent a new producer Id with epoch 0.\r\n\r\nThis patch also includes changes to the endTxnRequest to send the right request version based on whether txnV2 is enabled.\r\n\r\nThere was a test failure in the integration tests that allowed us to catch a bug in the PrepareComplete method where we update the transit metadata incorrectly. Added the bug fix in this patch where the lastProducerEpoch is updated correctly.","created_at":"2024-10-08T01:01:06Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T15:12:03Z","closed_at":"2024-11-01T15:12:00Z","merged_at":"2024-11-01T15:12:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"e14a81b4b288dfd85c340fb77a6f9ba9f6de1ce4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

the case of a metadata transaction whose BeginTransactionRecord is not the first record in a record batch, the records preceding the BeginTransactionRecord in the batch (and possibly other batches

This means the SnapshotGenerator can emit a snapshot whose fetch offset (lastContainedOffset + 1) \"X\" is not aligned to a batch boundary. This can result in followers/observers that fetch and apply this bad snapshot to be unable to successfully fetch thereafter since the follower will reject the fetched record batch that contains offset X (starting at offset X - M), since X - M < X.\r\n\r\n* Add boolean `isOffsetBatchAligned` to MetadataProvenance to determine if offset is the last record in a batch.\r\n* Do not emit snapshot unless

patch extracts all of the test classes and methods from the JUnit XML files and creates a set of YAML files.\r\n\r\nThe intention of these YAML files is to be checked into an orphaned Git branch and serve as a historical test catalog. Since the files are sorted, there will only be a diff if a test is added, removed, or renamed. This should limit the storage requirements for this \"database\". By keeping these files in Git, we can easily do things like checkout the file set at an older timestamp. \r\n\r\n> git checkout test-catalog @{'7 days ago'}\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this test catalog is to allow us to easily and efficiently answer the question: \"what test has been added recently\". More precisely, we want to know which tests have been added in the last 7 days _including_ new tests in a given PR. \r\n\r\nThe choice of YAML over plain text or JSON was primarily for compactness. Class names are not repeated, which makes the data set quite a bit smaller. The structure of YAML also gives us flexibility in the future for adding other data to this catalog.","created_at":"2024-10-07T17:21:53Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T13:57:50Z","closed_at":"2024-10-17T06:09:23Z","merged_at":"2024-10-17T06:09:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"ef6c950b88948717fcf7c5023a2cb593ef1007c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7388474305,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABuGMrwQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/build","name":"build","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Gradle

About\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17177#pullrequestreview-2301365314, post adding the `DelayedShareFetchPurgatory`, we are essentially not using the fetch queue any more. Or rather, we are now using the DelayedShareFetch purgatory as a fetch queue. This PR removes `fetchQueue` from `SharePartitionManager` altogether.\r\n\r\n### Ongoing tickets to consider while reviewing this PR\r\n1. [KAFKA-17510](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17510) - We need to refactor code between SharePartitionManager and DelayedShareFetch so that the initialization error of share partition gets considered. Also, if a sharePartition is being initialized, any pending shareFetchRequest is blocked in the purgatory. So, after the initialization completes, we need to trigger a check in the share fetch purgatory to wake up pending delayed operations.  \r\n2. [KAFKA-17829](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17829) - We need to add an integration test which verifies that on shutdown of the delayed share fetch purgatory, the share fetch requests which are present inside the purgatory return with an erroneous future. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe code has been tested with the help of unit test cases.","created_at":"2024-10-07T12:39:58Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T18:09:43Z","closed_at":"2024-10-18T08:37:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"edba1b345656b02c150391f74f6fd30722a5863c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

Rework uniform heterogeneous assignor to improve perf\r\n\r\nRework the uniform heterogeneous assignor to improve performance, while\r\npreserving the high level ideas and structure from the existing\r\nimplementation:\r\n * The assignor works in 3 stages: importing the previous assignment for\r\n   stickiness, assigning unassigned partitions and iteratively\r\n   reassigning partitions to improve balance.\r\n * Unassigned partitions are assigned to the subscribers with the least\r\n   number of partitions. This maximizes balance within a single topic.\r\n * During the iterative rebalancing phase, partitions are reassigned to\r\n   their previous owner if it improves balance (stickiness restoration).\r\n * During the iterative rebalancing phase, partitions are reassigned to\r\n   the subscriber with the least number of partitions to improve\r\n   balance.\r\n\r\nA non-exhaustive list of changes is:\r\n * The assignment of unassigned partitions and iterative reassignment\r\n   stages now works through partitions topic by topic. Previously\r\n   partitions from topics with the same number of partitions per\r\n   subscriber would be interleaved. Since we iterate topic by topic, we\r\n   can reuse data about topic subscribers.\r\n * Instead of maintaining TreeSets to find the least loaded subscribers,\r\n   we sort an ArrayList of subscribers once per topic and start filling\r\n   up subscribers, least loaded first. In testing, this approach was\r\n   found to be faster than maintaining PriorityQueues.\r\n * Implement stickiness restoration by creating a mapping of partitions\r\n   to previous owner and checking against that mapping, instead of\r\n   tracking partition movements during iterative reassignment.\r\n * Track member partition counts using a plain int array, to avoid\r\n   overhead from boxing and HashMap lookups. Member partition counts are\r\n   accessed very frequently and this needs to be fast. As a consequence,\r\n   we have to number members 0 to M - 1.\r\n * Bound the iterative reassignment stage to a fixed number of\r\n   iterations. Under some uncommon subscription patterns, the iterative\r\n   reassignment stage converges slowly. In these cases, the iterative\r\n   reassignment stage terminates without producing an optimally balanced\r\n   assignment anyway (see javadoc for balanceTopics).\r\n * Re-use Maps from the previous assignment where possible,\r\n   ie. introduce a copy-on-write mechanism while computing the new\r\n   assignment.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

About\r\nIn reference to comments https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17177#issuecomment-2392017658 and https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17177#issuecomment-2392108397 , this PR addresses the following - \r\n1. Move ActionQueue outside DelayedShareFetch class to SharePartitionManager where SharePartitionManager has the ability to add a delayed action to the ActionQueue.\r\n\r\n2. Add TopicPartition as a key for delayed share fetch along with SharePartition (that is already present right now). This will be utilized later when we add the code to know if new data has been added to the topic partition.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe code has been tested with the help of unit tests.","created_at":"2024-10-05T10:27:50Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T17:53:36Z","closed_at":"2024-10-09T17:53:36Z","merged_at":"2024-10-09T17:53:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"8125c3da5bb6ebb35a0cb3494624d33fad4e3187","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"apoorvmittal10","id":2861565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjE1NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2861565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10","html_url":"https://github.com/apoorvmittal10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apoorvmittal10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

several tools for topic configuration from the client side, to the broker-side. Several things are refactored:\r\n\r\n - Decoupling. On the client side, for example, RepartitionTopics was using the CopartitionedTopicEnforcer, the InternalTopicCreator, the TopologyMetadata and the Cluster objects. All of those are mocked with Mockito during testing. This points to bad coupling. We refactored all classes to be mostly self-sufficient, only relying on themselves and simple interfaces.\r\n - Tests only use JUnit5, not hamcrast matchers and no other streams utilities, to not pollute the group coordinator module.\r\n - All classes only modify the configurations -- the code does not actually call into the AdminClient anymore.\r\n - We map all errors to new errors in the broker, in particular, the error for missing topics, inconsistent internal topics, and invalid topologies.\r\n\r\nWe include the internal, mutable datastructures, that are set- and map-based for effiecient algorithms. They are distinctly different from the data represented in `StreamsGroupTopologyValue` and `StreamsGroupInitializeRequest`, since regular expressions must be resolved at this point.\r\n\r\nBoth the topic creation and internal topic validation will be based on this code.\r\n\r\nEvery time, either the broker-side topology or the topic metadata on the broker changes, we reconfigure the internal topics, check consistency with the current topics on the broker, and possibly trigger creation of the missing internal topics. These changes will be built on top of this change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-04T13:31:02Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T13:11:43Z","closed_at":"2024-10-22T13:11:41Z","merged_at":"2024-10-22T13:11:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"1bde29cccbad44ef8322b9c7f8e3a64f41e47810","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7491388177,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABvoWDEQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/clients","name":"clients","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/cfc7afc7e4a02c9b58ab9703ca8e62dd957a09f2","head":{"label":"lucasbru:kip1071pr/topic_configuration","ref":"kip1071pr/topic_configuration","sha":"cfc7afc7e4a02c9b58ab9703ca8e62dd957a09f2","user":{"login":"lucasbru","id":1628637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjg2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1628637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":533369486,"node_id":"R_kgDOH8qSjg","name":"kafka","full_name":"lucasbru/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lucasbru","id":1628637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjg2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1628637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru/kafka","description":"Mirror

API operations have two phases: lookup and fulfilment. The lookup phase involves a METADATA request whose details depend upon the operation being performed.\r\n\r\nFor some operations, the METADATA request can be quite expensive to serve. For example, if the user calls `Admin.listOffsets` for 1000 topics, the METADATA request will include all 1000 topics and the response will contain the leader information for all of these topics. And then the actual fulfilment phase does the real work of the operation.\r\n\r\nIn cases where a long-running application is performing repeated admin operations which need the same metadata information about partition leadership, it is not necessary to send the METADATA request for every single admin operation.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a cache of the mapping from topic-partition to leader id to the admin client. The cache doesn't need to be very sophisticated because the admin client will retry if the information becomes stale, and the cache can be updated as a result of the retry.\r\n\r\n### Committer

should not assume that the leader will send them BeginQuorumEpoch requests - see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17030 for more details.\r\n\r\nIf a voter is removed by the leader and hasn't replicated its own removal record yet, this change will help Unattached rediscover the leader (since the leader will not be sending BeginQuorumRequests to nodes it thinks are non-voters).\r\nWe can potentially prevent disruptive elections by these removed voters - before this change, unattached voters will sit for ~electionTimeout and then become candidates and start a disruptive election. \r\nPre-vote would prevent this disruptive election - but when implementing pre-vote we will then need a similar change to have nodes in Prospective state continue fetching from bootstrap servers/last known leader to prevent Prospective from becoming a terminal state.\r\n\r\nFollowers have a similar issue - if they are unable to communicate with the leader they should try contacting the bootstrap servers since they can't assume the leader will send beginQuorumRequests to them.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]
