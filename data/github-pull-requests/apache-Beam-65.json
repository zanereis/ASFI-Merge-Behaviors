Some early profiles show that there is an issue with the G1 garbage collector when storing so many small values that the GC management overhead dominates 75% of the execution which requires further investigation.\r\n![97qWBX8bwxXhHcb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10078956/215604050-1e1e96d2-6ac4-4b52-8210-829779145af7.png)\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                 (distribution)  (globallyWindowed)   Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine         uniform                true  thrpt    5   8.306 ± 1.255  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine         uniform               false  thrpt    5   7.849 ± 0.476  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine          normal                true  thrpt    5  10.575 ± 1.295  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine          normal               false  thrpt    5  10.772 ± 0.141  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine          hotKey                true  thrpt    5   9.131 ± 2.761  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine          hotKey               false  thrpt    5   8.302 ± 1.078  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine      uniqueKeys                true  thrpt    5   3.899 ± 1.737  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine      uniqueKeys               false  thrpt    5   4.203 ± 2.170  ops/s\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                 (distribution)  (globallyWindowed)   Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine         uniform                true  thrpt    5  88.740 ± 8.925  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine         uniform               false  thrpt    5  76.005 ± 5.150  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine          normal                true  thrpt    5  43.388 ± 1.966  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine          normal               false  thrpt    5  37.804 ± 7.177  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine          hotKey                true  thrpt    5  84.881 ± 5.040  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine          hotKey               false  thrpt    5  74.183 ± 2.063  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine      uniqueKeys                true  thrpt    5   5.567 ± 4.068  ops/s\r\nPrecombineGroupingTableBenchmark.sumIntegerBinaryCombine      uniqueKeys               false  thrpt    5   6.957 ± 1.508  ops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

1 of https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/24042\r\n\r\n* RunInference transform will accept side input emitting ModelMetadata.\r\n* The Side input must emit one value at a time. It should be compatible with AsSingleton view\r\n* All the metrics are tagged with unique id so that it would be easy to differentiate the metrics calculated by different models.\r\n* Add a RunInference pipeline visitor to check if the side inputs are enabled only during --streaming mode and to. check if the side input has windows other than GlobalWindows with non default trigger.\r\n\r\nThis method follows slowly changing side input patterns as described in https://beam.apache.org/documentation/patterns/side-inputs/\r\n\r\nTODO: \r\nPart 2: WatchFileTransform and it's use case. It will come in the following PRs.\r\nPart 3: DLQ for error outputs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

spending a bunch of times working with writing down schemas in Java recently one of the things that kept coming up was the need to make fields nullable more often than not.

removed some unnecessary caching when processing MultiParDos with additional but unconsumed outputs. With storage level \"Memory Only\" caching was done via RDDs. This also had a positive side effect as it breaks linage of the dataset. This is particularly beneficial with complex query plans as generated by TCPDS query 83 (due to #24314).\r\n\r\nWith caching removed, performance dropped for query 83. \r\nSee http://metrics.beam.apache.org/d/tkqc0AdGk2/tpc-ds-spark-classic-new-sql?orgId=1&viewPanel=38&from=1670799600000&to=1673305199000\r\n\r\nThis change tracks a rough complexity estimate of the datasets and breaks linage where necessary by converting it to an RDD and back again.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#24985 by adding a basic SchemaTransform implementation for SQLTransform. Some notable aspects of the configuration are trying to use enum logical types in the configuration schema to provide better discoverability for things like query planner implementations over time (and hopefully better error messages than the existing external transform).\r\n\r\nThere's no test coverage for the old external transform so I will probably continue to work on that. My solution for getting at the DLQ data is also somewhat hacky at the moment as investigation suggests doing it properly involves a pretty deep set of changes and I'd like to unblock the team with a working version rather than a perfect version.\r\n\r\ncc @pabloem @apilloud \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#25110\r\n\r\nreverting much of #25111 and #25169 and direct to the actual code path\r\n\r\nIn #25111 I assumed the cause is that the expansion service needs more time up when there is extra dependency. This is not true. The expansion service is a python interpreter call. It is markedly faster at the second time, which is why there is almost always one test (but not more) fail.\r\n\r\nThis is also a followup of a paralllel effort #25169\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR closes #25119 and addresses #19465 by:\r\n1. Change .test-infra/kubernetes/kafka-cluster/04-outside-services from LoadBalancer to NodePort\r\n2. Refactor .test-infra/kubernetes/kafka-cluster/05-kafka/10broker-config.yml to query `OUTSIDE_HOST` from k8s node `InternalIP` and `OUTSIDE_PORT` to query `outside-${KAFKA_BROKER_ID}`'s NodePort\r\n3. Added `nodeIPAddress` and `nodePort` methods to .test-infra/jenkins/Kubernetes.groovy and cooresponding .test-infra/kubernetes/kubernetes.sh to enable Node InternalIP and NodePort querying within a jenkins job context\r\n4. Refactor the following with `usePublicIps=false`\r\n    - .test-infra/jenkins/job_PerformanceTests_xlang_KafkaIO_Python.groovy\r\n    - .test-infra/jenkins/job_PerformanceTests_KafkaIO_IT.groovy\r\n5. terraform code to validate and provision Google Cloud networking requirements to support `usePublicIps=false` (Note: I already executed the terraform code, per personal communication, on apache-beam-testing GCP project)\r\n\r\nI was unable to test end-to-end the new workflow from jenkins job creation to seeing a Dataflow Job executing successfully in my own Google Cloud environment.  However, I was able to validate:\r\n1. Using a private IP compute engine instance in the same GCP network, https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart worked using the kubernetes cluster's node InternalIP and NodePort as the `--bootstrap-server`\r\n2. Spinning up .test-infra/dockerized-jenkins and seeding `job_PerformanceTests_xlang_KafkaIO_Python.groovy` from github.com/damondouglas/beam from branch `25119-fix-test-infra-kafka-service` built the test job using the queried kubernetes Node InternalIP and NodePort as the bootstrap_server arguments\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This includes initially outputting the initial list of partitions to be streamed, and as partitions split and merge, create new partitions to be streamed. DetectNewPartitions is also responsible to ensure all partitions are streamed and non are missing and keep track of the watermark of the entire pipeline.\r\n* ReadChangeStreamPartitionDoFn - Streams individual partitions and output data changes. It also handles termination, whether that's the end of the pipeline termination, or the partition has split or merged so it no longer exists.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

purpose of this PR is to support configurable gRPC channels for ArtifactService. We have use cases where we run the ExpansionService in different environments. One example environment is in Google Cloud Run. This requires authenticated gRPC calls with the google cloud token in the gRPC header and transport security enabled vs plaint text. With the current public methods, we can do this for the expand stub with no problem, but not for the artifact stub which would need the same channel configuration.  We ended up monkey patching this to get our use case to work. I am contributing the monkey patch back to beam. \r\n\r\naddress #25840 \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of #24866 \r\n\r\nIt is found that dataframe compatibility matrix tests are actually not exercised after splitting due to a typo.\r\n\r\nAlso, sharded precommits set up full version of pyarrow and pytorch compatibility test tasks, but most of them do not have test run. Observed that most of these tests costs >20 min run, where about 10 minutes are contributed by the tox setup for these compability test tasks. This is inefficient. Moved these tasks to be exercised by beam_PreCommit_Python_Coverage which deals with precommit tests exercised by single py version (currently is Py38).\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
