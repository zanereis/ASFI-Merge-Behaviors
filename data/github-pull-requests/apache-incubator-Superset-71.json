SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the `AlteredSliceTag` pill appears when there are changes to `url_params` in the form data. Since these are not persisted in chart metadata (see #18960), we should ignore temporary control values when comparing old vs new form data. A test is also added to ensure the pill doesn't render when there are changes present in `url_params`.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the pill no longer appears when refreshing a chart with a change to `url_params`:\r\n<img width=\"1269\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/165238959-23c964f3-17da-4221-9452-5dd62152a489.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the pill would always appear when refreshing the chart due to `explore_form_data` and other url params being present in the URL:\r\n<img width=\"1269\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/165239309-d3d724e3-2180-4009-ad1b-992e7c2e1f87.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe aggregate function **count_distinct** isn't ANSI SQL. Currently, when the user uses `simple metric`, the AdhocMetric control will generate a `count_distinct(column)` for the label. If the user switches to the SQL tab, this label will apply to SQL. It isn't ANSI SQL, so directly use this SQL snippet, the error will appear on many databases.\r\n\r\nThis PR transform _count distinct metric_ from `count_distinct(column)` to `count(distinct column)`, but does not change the original metric label(verbose name).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/165227389-3aede361-7216-439f-a261-211f5711f553.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. select `birth_name` dataset.\r\n2. select `count_distinct` as AGGREGATE, and `num` as COLUMN in metric popover.\r\n3. query\r\n4. open `count_distinct` metric, and switch to `custom SQL`, verify the SQL is `COUNT(DISTINCT num)`, but the label is still `count_distinct(num)`.\r\n5. copy and paste the `COUNT(DISTINCT num)` in `custom SQL`, verify the label has been changed.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR was made to fix the issue where users were not easily able to resize the column width of the Markdown widget when editing a dashboard. From my investigation of the code, I found that there was indeed a container handle on the right side of a Markdown widget, it was just very narrow compared to the right side container handles of the other charts within a dashboard.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, I just needed to modify the `resizable.less` file so that `.resizable-container-handle--right` behaves the same way as `.resizable-container-handle--bottom`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n(The resize cursor is not easily selectable, as the handle to resize it is very narrow)\r\n![Very Small Column Resize Selection Area](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96579982/165145686-5c43af2f-1543-4d1c-93d7-9b586d3f15ee.PNG)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n(The resize cursor is now much easier to select, as the handle for it has been widened and is now the same size as the handle on the bottom of the widget)\r\n![After Fix - Resize Markdown Width](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96579982/165145704-714b7dc7-cdad-420a-ae8e-38411b6ed11d.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Go to a dashboard which contains a Markdown widget, or add a Markdown widget to a new or existing dashboard.\r\n2. Select the \"Edit dashboard\" button (pencil icon in the top right of the page).\r\n3. Try to adjust the width of the markdown widget.\r\n4. You will notice that it is now much easier to select the resize handle compared to before the code changes.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe changes allow a user to use the SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR function to add statements such as SET ROLE without breaking functionality. Currently, adding a statemen like this works fine in the SQL Editor, but Charts run individual statements by splitting a passed query and throw errors since SET ROLE does not return any data on its own. With the new MUTATE_AFTER_SPLIT variable, users can choose to apply the mutator function after the chart's query execution function splits a given query, allowing users to apply a change to all statements in a query and have Chart functionality not be interrupted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nIn the config file, update the SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR function to add a statement which does not return any results on its own and is something which should be run alongside all other statements in a given query. An example of this is adding a SET ROLE statement to the beginning of a query. Create a new Chart and see if queries return errors due to no data being fetched. Now in the config file, add a MUTATE_AFTER_SPLIT variable and set it equal to True. Create a new Chart and make a query, and verify that the desired results are showing.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nMost people and departments in enterprise companies are addicted to spreadsheets. Currently our customers are heavily demanding Excel reports and, unfortunately, we have failed to persuade them to continue with CSV.\r\n\r\nSo here I am with a PR that adds the ability to attach XLSX files as report data and notifications (slack).

I wasn't able to test slack since I don't use it actively but implemented it nevertheless for completeness.\r\n\r\n### Known Problems\r\n\r\nCurrently the first column is displayed like

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe changes allow a user to use the SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR function to add statements such as SET ROLE without breaking functionality. Currently, adding a statement like this works fine in the SQL Editor, but Charts run individual statements by splitting a passed in query and throw errors since SET ROLE does not return any data on its own. With the new MUTATE_AFTER_SPLIT variable, users can choose to apply the mutator function after the chart's query execution function splits a given query, allowing users to apply a change to all statements in a query and have Chart functionality not be interrupted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nIn the config file, update the SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR function to add a statement which does not return any results on its own and is something which should be run alongside all other statements in a given query. An example of this is adding a SET ROLE statement to the beginning of a query. Create a new Chart and see if queries return errors due to no data being fetched. Now in the config file, set the MUTATE_AFTER_SPLIT equal to True. Create a new Chart and make a query, and verify that the desired results are showing.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nOn Postgres `LongBinary` equates to `BYTEA` which can store 1 Gb values. However, it turns out `LongBinary` without a specified `length` creates `BLOB` on MySQL, which is limited to 64 kb. To make sure the `value` column on the `key_value` table is as wide on MySQL as it is on Postgres, we specify the length to ensure that an appropriately sized column is created.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to solve the intermittent issues we're having with our integration tests, to make them deterministic.\r\n\r\n#### Exploration & findings\r\n\r\nThe issue we're having, seemingly randomly, is with one of the following:\r\n* `AdhocFilters`\r\n* `AdhocMetrics`\r\n* `Advanced analytics`\r\n* `Annotations`\r\n\r\nSome examples of these tests failing in the past:\r\n* https://github.com/apache/superset/actions/runs/2190832016\r\n* https://github.com/apache/superset/actions/runs/2065080717\r\n\r\nLooking at several of these errors, the snapshots show something very similar to each other:\r\n![AdhocMetrics -- Clear metric and set simple adhoc metric -- before each hook (failed) (attempt 3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/164773820-d61b7f9d-e8b2-410b-86bd-df21cc5c3b67.png)\r\n\r\nThe error `The URL is missing the dataset_id or slice_id parameters.` occurs when these params are not found.\r\nBack to the tests, we're trying to explore the same chart, `Num Births Trend`, by performing the following action:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncy.visitChartByName('Num Births Trend');\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn turn, `visitChartByName`, does the following:\r\n```js\r\ncy.request(`/chart/api/read?_flt_3_slice_name=${name}`).then(response => {\r\n  cy.visit(`${BASE_EXPLORE_URL}{\"slice_id\": ${response.body.pks[0]}}`);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, we try to fetch the slice information by name, to get the id and route to the explore.\r\nThe `/chart/api/read` works (aka, returns 200) for the failed tests, but, it returns 0 results.\r\nSo, that's why we're seeing the error, and why the test is failing.\r\n\r\n#### Root cause\r\nThe chart we're trying to access exists, and the test is correct.\r\nIf it's not deterministic then, it must be that other test is messing with the data these tests are using.\r\nI can think of two potential causes:\r\n1. The chart is renamed by other test\r\n2. The chart is deleted by other test\r\n\r\nInvestigating, I found a test inside `chart list view` suite that performs a bulk delete, which seems to be the culprit.\r\nThis test bulk deletes the first two charts.\r\n\r\nThis explains the issue and why the tests are non-deterministic:\r\n* We have a test that potentially deletes our chart\r\n* That deletion could delete different charts depending on execution\r\n\r\nThis happens because, when we load the chart list view, the charts are ordered by modification date, which means, if other test modified the `Num Births Trend` chart before the bulk delete, then that chart is getting deleted.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n\r\nIf we sort the chart list view by name, then we ensure this test always deletes the same charts, and it does not impact the charts other tests rely on.\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\nOur integration tests have dependencies (whether expected or not) and we need to consider/restructure the execution to ensure we get the same deterministic result, always.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nAs a result of changes in PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19039, when user switched query mode in table chart between Aggregate and Raw Records, the controls in currently inactive mode were being reset. This PR fixes that problem by introducing a new prop `resetOnHide`, which is true by default and set to false in table chart controls.\r\nPlease consider this PR as a hotfix - we should probably figure out a more sturdy, foolproof solution.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/164252120-0641eae7-c268-4fbe-bd3c-9f50cd98656d.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/164252307-2b3af4a7-fd52-40fb-9d87-bca68e81f51a.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a table chart\r\n2. Add some values to controls in aggregate mode\r\n3. Add some values to controls in raw records mode\r\n4. Switch between the modes a few times, verify that controls are not being reset\r\n5. Run query, verify that values of currently hidden controls are not included in the query\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR reverts the changes in #19038 that affected world maps. #19038 added a control `CATEGORICAL COLOR SCHEME` to world maps which could override the linear color scheme if specified. This inadvertently broke all linear coloring for our world map charts because it was not possible to specify a null categorical color scheme.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"583\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14146019/164065408-b2c056bf-504f-4ea5-8105-460d30c0328f.png\">\r\n\r\nRather than fix the behavior of the categorical color scheme, I thought a better fix might be to just remove the categorical color scheme feature from world maps. World maps _require_ the `METRIC FOR COLOR` control, so I'm not sure it makes sense to support a categorical color scheme.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nMake world map chart with linear color scheme, confirm colors applied as expected\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n#### Before Dataframe\r\nBefore [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19716), in the timeseries charts, the result column names follow the simple rules that combine all the levels into a single string. For example, in the birth_name dataset, select 1) `ds` as x-axis, 2) `sum_num` as metrics 3) `gender` as dimensions 4) `1990 : 2000` as time range 5) `1 year ago` and `actual values` in time comparison.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFollowing plan to gradually deprecate \"REST\" endpoints on `/superset` namespace.\r\n\r\nDeprecates `/superset//fave_dashboards/<int:user_id>/`. Proposed removal on Superset 3.0\r\nDeprecates `/fave_dashboards_by_username/<username>/`. Proposed removal on Superset 3.0\r\n\r\nReplaced by an existing endpoint /api/v1/dashboard/, includes the necessary frontend migration.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The use of the generic get list endpoint will not fetch the date when the dashboard was favorited, this would force us to create a new endpoint specifically for this query or always enforce N+1 queries on the get list (not an option). \r\n\r\nI've Replaced this date by the humanised version of the dashboard creation date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n## Before:\r\n<img width=\"867\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-04-18 at 12 22 01\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/163801287-3c88ef89-f2d0-4a45-b248-c6afc95b3c9b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## After:\r\n<img width=\"873\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-04-18 at 12 17 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/163800851-01938198-94b9-4934-9de7-10af8cb349d3.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements the redesign of data panel in Explore (below the chart container).\r\n\r\n1. Removed the \"Data\" header that expands/collapses on click\r\n2. Moved expand/collapse functionality to tabs header. When collapsed, clicking on expand button opens tabs showing \"Results\" by default OR the last active tab before collapsing\r\n3. When collapsed, user can also click on tab name to expand with that tab active\r\n4. When expanded, user can hide the tables by clicking on collapse button OR by clicking on active tab name\r\n5. Moved row count, copy button and search from tabs header to tab content - now they look more in context of currently displayed table\r\n6. Now Results and Samples have separate searches - the search text is no longer shared between those 2 tables\r\n7. Refactored ChartPanel - now we no longer manually calculate widths and heights of chart panel and tables panel. It's all based on css flex.\r\n8. Tables functionality remains unchanged - the request is sent only when the table is activated the first time or there were changes to query\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1786\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/163774386-0af6c816-48bf-4362-be70-0cf36fb19054.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/163774419-642c9a8c-02e2-483f-b433-a6967f0b8c6f.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/163785258-aa293ede-90e4-4d63-950b-5309f41cc3ff.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/163774710-9967adf7-6a0f-47a9-9d74-a24554f255f2.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a chart\r\n2. Verify that collapsing/expanding works as described in PR's summary\r\n3. Verify that copy button and row counter work as before for both results and samples\r\n4. Verify that typing search text in 1 table doesn't affect search filter in second table\r\n5. Verify that chart panel and data table panel don't overflow on each other and scale well when window width changes\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, we don't have tests that ensure query accuracy. For example, we should combine database results and post-processing calculation if the user applies time comparison, then verify the results and the expected results.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a pattern that the developer easily constructs **query context** and **query object**, and verifies the query results and expected results.\r\n\r\nThis PR should wait for [relative PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19752) to merge first. 19752 fixed `SqlaTable` can't trigger delete event issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the util function that fetches the permalink salt is memoized. This can cause trouble if the workers need to reference different metastores. While removal of the `memoized` decorator will have a performance impact, it should be negligible, as it's very light weight and occurs fairly infrequently. I will look into a better solution for avoiding refetching the salt on each permalink action.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nDecoding a permalink with a salt different to that with which it was encrypted results in the following error:\r\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/163769791-8ae96dbc-f06d-45bd-9f8b-a77820201e35.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR removes the pseudo range index  added in post_processing when converting to csv. \r\n\r\nWhen sending reports as csv or inline text, this id is also included. I believe it does not add any value to output however if it is somehow useful, it is better to include it either via query or make it optional.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR addresses several small issues detected when editing the top level tabs in the dashboard.\r\n\r\nThe main problem behind them is that the tab & the content, being different components, were not 100% in sync after re-order/add/remove actions on them.\r\nThis PR hoists the state handling up for this scenarios and ensure the state is driven in the same way.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Issue 1\r\nWhen adding a new tab, the container gets selected & the \"Collapse tab content\" popup appears.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/163430295-bab4a35d-0153-4c6c-8b1f-eae99574faff.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/163431027-21727e56-54dc-4024-9dec-c9e0f4629b12.mov\r\n\r\n#### Issue 2\r\nWhen adding a new tab, said tab is selected, but the content still reflects the one from a previous tab\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/163430063-b473481c-698e-47ed-8aca-e0dab1513629.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/163431201-f4b4237d-7e83-4769-844e-1a2a05c55240.mov\r\n\r\n#### Issue 3\r\nReordering tabs makes the tab & content out of sync, so the current tab content is lost.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/163430509-87f70220-88ad-46c7-80f8-46b846931613.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/163431430-dc3dab83-f59f-441e-b059-04b5d79a1686.mov\r\n\r\n#### Issue 4\r\nDeleting a tab always switches to the last one. This should only happen if the tab being deleted is the current one the user is seeing, otherwise, nothing should change.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/163430688-3faf2133-390e-40c9-bc0c-896332fc2d7e.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/163431781-94f819e3-1e66-4de9-901b-0d39763fa28c.mov\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis is an alternative implementation of #19701, which reuses the same data type inference logic that's already being used when creating physical datasets. While I did this fix I started adding types for the column type objects, but that turned into a HUGE rabbit hole going well beyond the scope of this PR. Therefore the changes in this PR are kept to a minimum to fix the issue at hand, but once this is merged I'll open up a PR that introduces proper types to to these code paths.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. create a dataset on BigQuery that contains at least a String array type (Type: STRING, Mode: REPEATED)\r\n2. Add a single row to the dataset (can be all nulls)\r\n2. Go to SQL Lab and run the following query `select * from schema.table`\r\n3. Hit \"Explore\" and see an error.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAlthough showing names is a very nice feature, not showing all of them creates confusion. \r\n\r\nFor example, for GMT +03:00 our users are expecting `Europe/Istanbul` but instead are seeing `Antartica/Syowa` as the name.\r\n\r\nI believe, if we are deduplicating zones, showing just the timezone offset should be enough and concise.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

- Change <code>Global</code> component to use the <code>StyleSheet</code> constructor of the current <code>cache.sheet</code>.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently there is an infinite redirect on the login page (when users are not logged in) that is triggered by an unfortunate sequence of changes:\r\n\r\n1. [#17597](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17597) added redirect to login when API request returns 401\r\n2. [#19051](https://github.com/preset-io/superset/blob/0d2ec229f62b01046947d915f0d7d31d63078dfa/superset-frontend/src/views/CRUD/data/database/DatabaseList.tsx#L205-L218) starts to call the `/api/v1/database` API to find out whether there are databases with file upload enabled, even when the menu is rendered on a page where users haven't logged in. (Although I'm not sure why the redirects didn't show up in #19051's ephemeral environment.)\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, I also found out that users without admin access will also see an empty \"Data\" menu, so I fixed that as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nWhen logged in as non admin users:\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n<img width=\"345\" alt=\"Xnip2022-04-13_16-57-59\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/163288964-cbb810d9-9973-4ca6-8b20-ab49693aa6a5.png\">\r\n\r\nThere is an empty `Data` menu item with no submenu.\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n<img width=\"322\" alt=\"Xnip2022-04-13_16-57-21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/163289000-e715303d-a978-4526-b75d-e39530cb1985.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `Data` menu item is removed\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Log out and go to `<superset url>/login`. You may see infinitely redirect without this PR. For example, check the [ephemeral](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19703) environment of #19703 \r\n2. Log in as a non-admin user (e.g. `username: alpha,  passwd: general`), check whether the empty menu item still exists.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nBefore, when user made some changes to controls, we displayed an overlay with \"Run query\" button. This PR removes that overlay and introduces an alert banner that tells the user that some controls have changed and that they should click \"Update chart\" button. Thanks to that, the user can still view their chart while doing changes to controls.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/163240324-f09abeb7-588a-4953-b0a4-787bbc83d80d.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a chart\r\n2. Do some changes in controls and verify that an alert banner showed up.\r\n3. After clicking \"Update chart\" the banner should disappear.\r\n4. When banner is visible, the chart should still respond to events that trigger rerendering, such as changing the width of browser window.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant
