Description ##\r\nRevert a change in model zoo test. @zhreshold \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Avoid testing all pretrained models.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-24T04:54:42Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T07:58:04Z","closed_at":"2018-01-24T07:58:00Z","merged_at":"2018-01-24T07:58:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"20253d5ce821ac012e2483b5dfb15bb5b7202f6d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/2849c8e763501bf35f4e5daacb455c5f965ddb1f","head":{"label":"apache:szha-patch-1","ref":"szha-patch-1","sha":"2849c8e763501bf35f4e5daacb455c5f965ddb1f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] link fix\r\n\r\n## Comments

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-19T14:26:19Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T20:12:40Z","closed_at":"2018-09-12T20:12:25Z","merged_at":"2018-09-12T20:12:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"64566872a28a9426f3ec20bcf0210ebb608854f8","assignee":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9496/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9496/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9496/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3b34b5031e083bece75fadea72e9018923a2455c","head":{"label":"lvaleriu:patch-3","ref":"patch-3","sha":"3b34b5031e083bece75fadea72e9018923a2455c","user":{"login":"lvaleriu","id":927999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNzk5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/927999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu","html_url":"https://github.com/lvaleriu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73566330,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzU2NjMzMA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"lvaleriu/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lvaleriu","id":927999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNzk5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/927999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu","html_url":"https://github.com/lvaleriu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleri

about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-17T20:43:58Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T18:34:47Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T18:34:47Z","merged_at":"2018-01-31T18:34:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ac6dcd1b5172a9d298d74751f44dfcdb5af26ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6cdaba1cfdeb0ac9e54cedc3ec051e20d159667c","head":{"label":"hubenjm:patch-3","ref":"patch-3","sha":"6cdaba1cfdeb0ac9e54cedc3ec051e20d159667c","user":{"login":"hubenjm","id":5203093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDMwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5203093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm","html_url":"https://github.com/hubenjm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104399069,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzOTkwNjk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"hubenjm/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hubenjm","id":5203093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDMwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5203093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm","html_url":"https://github.com/hubenjm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubenjm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hubenjm/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR moves the logging of storage fallback message and other error messages from individual operator's FInferStorage to a common place, by checking the value of `dispatch_mode` and return code of FInferStorage.\r\n\r\n@reminisce @anirudh2290 @cjolivier01 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nProposal for use of codeowners file\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ not complete, waiting for voting to complete on dev@] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ NA] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [NA ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-16T00:37:26Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T19:22:14Z","closed_at":"2018-01-22T19:22:14Z","merged_at":"2018-01-22T19:22:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"be8134d2a5dce07a658c59a947a04afe3bda1762","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9448/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9448/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9448/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6064120aa5be3b1058fff704e7f0fd43c4184315","head":{"label":"srochel:patch-19","ref":"patch-19","sha":"6064120aa5be3b1058fff704e7f0fd43c4184315","user":{"login":"srochel","id":12239237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM5MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12239237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel","html_url":"https://github.com/srochel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srochel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c74cf1b3e3be8cfab7f92f646c9ac46ebe2ff6f8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-15T23:12:01Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T18:23:14Z","closed_at":"2018-01-16T18:23:14Z","merged_at":"2018-01-16T18:23:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"59700b0ffeb5a19273e212f38695a9499dce56a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9445/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9445/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9445/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1de3d88a8f69e626ae5db531faa416b746678336","head":{"label":"lvaleriu:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"1de3d88a8f69e626ae5db531faa416b746678336","user":{"login":"lvaleriu","id":927999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNzk5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/927999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu","html_url":"https://github.com/lvaleriu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73566330,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzU2NjMzMA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"lvaleriu/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lvaleriu","id":927999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNzk5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/927999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu","html_url":"https://github.com/lvaleriu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvaleriu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lvaleriu/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdd multithreading on CPU for the class of broadcast_reduce operators. For unknown reasons, this class of operators does not use any internal threading so far and therefore was observed to become a serious runtime bottleneck in an application. Threading is done on the level of sequences to be reduced, not within a single reduce sequence. This pattern is in line with the one that we are already doing in elemwise_binary_broadcast_op.h (where we achieve threading when starting the binary_broadcast_kernel). \r\nWith this change, this class of operators shows good threading whenever we reduce over multiple sequences and matches the runtime characteristics of elemwise_binary_broadcast.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nAdd a small test to trigger a backtrace.\r\n\r\nfork doesn't work in Windows, so this can be tested from Python once C++ tests are enabled in CI\r\n\r\nPlease merge this PR first, then I will update submodule:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/356\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nTest LRN Changes for MKLDNN\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-15T14:33:27Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T14:37:19Z","closed_at":"2018-01-15T14:37:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c5b41a34718a38bbba2df89663eb2ee4e759f73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/afd3933ee9f67b601b8bf1b0481fb83a25c1127d","head":{"label":"pengzhao-intel:refactor","ref":"refactor","sha":"afd3933ee9f67b601b8bf1b0481fb83a25c1127d","user":{"login":"pengzhao-intel","id":22461308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDYxMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22461308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/pengzhao-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhao-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6dcb0ebb39558d83df4d9fd0338a46f775b94bd6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nProposal to clarify the use of CODEOWNERS for Apache MXNet contributors and comitters.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nChange is not complete and needs to be finalized.

Description ##\r\nIn order to root-cause issues in new BN operator, need to trigger Jenkins tests.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-14T09:27:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T09:54:12Z","closed_at":"2018-01-18T09:54:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc59f86c347bc182f87b01b9a3f7be7921391dc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/354c55fd0a225cf2659db9417726e943c5334dec","head":{"label":"TaoLv:bn-test","ref":"bn-test","sha":"354c55fd0a225cf2659db9417726e943c5334dec","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best

Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a

Description ##\r\n\r\nI observed failures in \"nosetests test_operator_gpu.py:test_random\" in the check for repeatable sequences given identical seeds.  These failures are due to a lack of synchronization (i.e. race) between the setting of the seed by the gpu and a subsequent request for random numbers.  The test failures were only occasional and occurred more repeatably on the older, slower GPUs.\r\n\r\nThe first commit of this PR adds two new tests designed to accentuate the problem.  The test_random.py:test_parallel_random_seed_setting test targets the 'ResourceParallelRandom' that was recently added and fails consistently on multiple generations of GPUs.  The test_random.py:test_random_seed_setting test targets the legacy 'ResourceRandom' and does not exhibit any failures, suggesting the race issue is only present in the new parallel random generator.\r\n\r\nThe second commit of the PR adds the needed synchronization to ResourceParallelRandom and remedies the failure of the included test.  Since no failure was ever seen in ResourceRandom, I refrained from adding a similar synchronization where none is apparently needed.  I can add such a synchronization blindly if desired.\r\n\r\n@piiswrong @szha @yzhliu might have some interest in this PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Passed code style

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-12T19:43:44Z","updated_at":"2018-03-24T06:47:17Z","closed_at":"2018-01-14T17:27:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75182cde506484b6852e76a7b621678e998f29ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5d1c732a397b1818ca87d1eb946f27c92d70ef51","head":{"label":"zheng-da:test_refactor","ref":"test_refactor","sha":"5d1c732a397b1818ca87d1eb946f27c92d70ef51","user":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103710066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MTAwNjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-12T18:12:52Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T20:28:35Z","closed_at":"2018-01-12T20:28:35Z","merged_at":"2018-01-12T20:28:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"67cfbc863d9d05baa2362a82cb78e0acb569d6ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/565ce45abffcf4bc8268bfd38cd608a5ded72bd2","head":{"label":"piiswrong:revert","ref":"revert","sha":"565ce45abffcf4bc8268bfd38cd608a5ded72bd2","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44707337,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcwNzMzNw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"piiswrong/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong/mxnet","description":"Efficient

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Serve embedding files from apache-mxnet s3 bucket backed by CDN. Include licenses in doc.\r\n- [x] Include all 294 fast-text embedding files as built-ins.\r\n- [x] Refactor download logic. Reuse mxnet repo logic from other modules.\r\n- [x] Check existing embedding files for hash match and skip download if matched\r\n- [x] Update embedding parsing to be line-by-line to reduce peak memory usage.\r\n- [x] Update test for downloadable embedding to not rely on 800mb file, and use relative path instead of default user path in tests.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- No API

reverts commit 8ad77f3ed8eced5e98661a3828dd22104f356d4e.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nFor the time being the server seems to be stable again, so I'm opening this PR to optionally allow commiters to re-enable the tests.\r\n\r\nI feel this test should be refactored such that future web server outages don't break the build.  The test seems to be mostly setting up declarative code.  During a quick review I noticed that there's for example no asserts in the majority of these tests.  It would be great if someone could verify that these tests are actually testing their respective intended units of work.\r\n\r\nIf merged this addresses issue:

Description ##\r\n\r\nSInce some other version of this fix (which I had in my personal branch) was requiring mshadow change (I dont know why, but per larroy email to dev@)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes IMRead which can crash the python interpreter.\r\nImproves the image tests by not decompressing the tar file on each test.\r\nAdds unit tests for graceful error handling of the modified code.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n1. Include test project for Windows build\r\n2. Fix some Link error in tests\r\n3. Update nnum to latest master since there's a fix for ut as well\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/pull/296\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Include ut projects in CMake for MSVC build\r\n- [ ] Fix link error in ut projects by adding MXNET_API to classes/methods\r\n- [ ] Update nnum to latest master since there's a fix for ut as well https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/pull/296\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis  change limits the test_nccl.py script to run 8 GPUs only. There is a but in NCCL 2.1 that causes segmentation fault when the test is run on 16 GPUs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [y ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [y] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n

Description ##\r\nUse provided scope for log4j dependencies\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix CUDA auto-detect and cxx flags\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\nOut of the scope of this PR.\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Windows\r\n   - Fixed config so Windows pip, virtualenv, docker, and build from source selector appears.\r\n   - Windows > Python > GPU > build from source instructions are available now under the appropriate heading.\r\n   - Windows > Python > CPU > pip install added\r\n- Mac\r\n   - Mac > Python > GPU > Build from Source - Added Mac OS X GPU build from source instructions.\r\n- Various adjustments to repair validation sections.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nDocuments #9217 for at least a non-OpenCV build. Mac + GPU + OpenCV is uncertain.\r\nFixes #9146 (broken selector)\r\n\r\nExisting PR #8619 - will need to rebase with this update and should probably just add updated installation info to the existing section in this file instead of the separate windows_setup.md file.\r\n\r\nWindows CPU Build From Source needs validation and improved information since the existing docs really seem to focus on GPU builds only.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-09T01:58:37Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T21:38:42Z","closed_at":"2018-01-18T21:36:06Z","merged_at":"2018-01-18T21:36:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"55ce97c602fa12e7753f27064f0676344297a032","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/df8ef2c363ac61db742f88232e85021101c5784e","head":{"label":"aaronmarkham:mac-gpu","ref":"mac-gpu","sha":"df8ef2c363ac61db742f88232e85021101c5784e","user":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105819747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MTk3NDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to

Description ##\r\nFixes the C++ unit tests. The operation registrations were not invoked due to symbol stripping by the linker on Mac (clang).\r\n\r\n## Dependencies ##\r\n\r\nThis change depends on:\r\n\r\n- apache:master -> **Fix broken unit test compilation** [#9321](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9321)\r\n- dmlc:master -> **Add fully qualified type on define default_real_t** [#317](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/pull/317/commits)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [Removed tabs from cmake file](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9349/commits/23d04ff84f239ca5e43c348c571d6e70a37dc446)\r\n- [Added special clang flag](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9349/commits/e1fd101ae0f304b6e5a03ad604ac69cd3d2fbf4b)\r\n  \r\n

and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] To the my best

checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage: N/A\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Modified example/ctc to include both sym.contrib.ctc_loss and sym.WarpCTC loss in one example\r\n- Added multiprocess CAPTCHA image generation to allow fast training\r\n- Reorganized the code into different files\r\n- Added code for inference by loading symbol and parameters from checkpoint\r\n- Removed predict_ocr.py script because:\r\n  - It is broken, even after fixing the amalgamation library\r\n  - Python interface of amalgamation library has dependency on mxnet.so, which defeats the purpose of using amalgamation\r\n- Updated README\r\n- Updated the associated tutorial\r\n- Removed speech_lstm tutorial since the associated example is already

Description ##\r\nRemove the hard-coded `in_channels=3` in resnet in gluon model zoo. Thanks @gmono for identifying the issue in #9336.\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] For resnet v1 and v2, set `in_channels` to 0.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Fully backward compatible.\r\n

[x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this
