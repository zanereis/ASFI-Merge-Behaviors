unit test for Date and Time type time zone problem while testing PutSQL processor\r\n\r\n@paulgibeault made the original PR #1073, #1468 \r\n@patricker add support of **DATE** and **TIME** in Epoch format for PutSQL processor.\r\nI’ve fix the unit test in different time zone problem.\r\nThe detail is list below\r\n\r\nThe originally problem with unit test happens because of different time zone.\r\nInternally without specifying time zone, java.sql.Date and java.sql.Time will use local time zone to parse the time.\r\nAs a result, different time zone will have different format result for a given constant time value.\r\nThis is mentioned by @mattyb149 in https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1524\r\n\r\nCurrently solve the problem by giving time zone before insert and parse result with same time zone. (GMT)\r\nCurrently build and test successfully with NiFi newest version on GitHub which is 1.4.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Refactored variable names to better represents what those are meant for.\r\n- Added deterministic logic which detects target filesystem timestamp precision and adjust lag time based on it.\r\n- Changed from using System.nanoTime() to System.currentTimeMillis in test because Java File API reports timestamp in milliseconds at the best granularity. Also, System.nanoTime should not be used in mix with epoch milliseconds because it uses arbitrary origin and measured differently.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
