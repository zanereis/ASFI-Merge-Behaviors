Then sqlContext.sparkContext.cancelJobGroup(statementId) does nothing.\r\nBut then the execute thread can start the jobs, and only then get interrupted and exit through here. But then it will exit here, and no-one will cancel these jobs and they will keep running even though this execution has exited.\r\n\r\nSo  when execute() was interrupted by `cancel()`, when get into

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrometheus.io is a CNCF project used widely with K8s.\r\n- https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to simplify `Prometheus` support by adding `PrometheusServlet` and `PrometheusResource`. The main use cases are `K8s` and `Spark Standalone` cluster environments.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR focus Spark-generated metrics. Also, we need to update the document later in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere exists a few ways to support `Prometheus`. However, they requires extra configurations and new resources (`port numbers to pull` or `gateways to push`). And, the endpoints are widely spreader over `Master/Slave/Driver/CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend`. This PR aims to export natively Spark's metrics which starts with **metrics_** prefix from the existing (1) method at `Master/Worker/Driver`. For task metrics, instead of using `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend `, we will reuse the collected information used for the Apache Spark REST API, `api/v1`.\r\n1. Spark JMX Sink + Prometheus JMX Converter\r\n2. Custom Sink + Prometheus Pushgateway\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. New web interfaces are added along with the existing JSON API.\r\n\r\n|              |                         JSON End Point                       |            Prometheus End Point          | \r\n|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis commit enables concurrent writes to different partitions in the same table with dynamicPartitionOverwrite enabled.  Currently Spark uses table's location as output when writing to the table, which would conflict each other(multiple `OutputCommitter`s operating on the same output dir) when writing to the same table concurrently.  In this commit, we set OutputCommitter's output to stagingDir to avoid collision when dynamicPartitionOverwrite is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is an improvement of user case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, users can expect success concurrent write to the same table\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded two tests and existing tests for regression.","created_at":"2019-09-10T02:28:52Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T08:26:15Z","closed_at":"2019-09-24T08:26:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2026cf2d20358abb31a5acefac8b6b67853f12d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- For trait without companion object constructor, currently the method to get constructor parameters `constructParams` in `ScalaReflection` will throw exception.\r\n```\r\nscala.ScalaReflectionException: <none> is not a term\r\n\tat scala.reflect.api.Symbols$SymbolApi.asTerm(Symbols.scala:211)\r\n\tat scala.reflect.api.Symbols$SymbolApi.asTerm$(Symbols.scala:211)\r\n\tat scala.reflect.internal.Symbols$SymbolContextApiImpl.asTerm(Symbols.scala:106)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection.getCompanionConstructor(ScalaReflection.scala:909)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection.constructParams(ScalaReflection.scala:914)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection.constructParams$(ScalaReflection.scala:912)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection$.constructParams(ScalaReflection.scala:47)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection.getConstructorParameters(ScalaReflection.scala:890)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection.getConstructorParameters$(ScalaReflection.scala:886)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection$.getConstructorParameters(ScalaReflection.scala:47)\r\n```\r\n- Instead this PR would throw exception:\r\n```\r\nUnable to find constructor for type [XXX]. This could happen if [XXX] is an interface or a trait without companion object constructor\r\nUnsupportedOperationException:\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the normal usage of ExpressionEncoder, this can happen if the type is interface extending `scala.Product`. Also, since this is a protected method, this could have been other arbitrary types without constructor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- The error message `<none> is not a term` isn't helpful for users to understand the problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n- The exception would be thrown instead of runtime exception from the `scala.ScalaReflectionException`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Added a unit test to illustrate the `type` where expression encoder will fail and trigger the proposed error message.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-09T21:47:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T23:43:50Z","closed_at":"2019-09-10T23:43:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70d1d36518e6e5d9cab1b3be1987dab788a12aa1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/722a09020a587fb3f55902e9d40e0ba1d7e86bac","head":{"label":"mickjermsurawong-stripe:SPARK-29026","ref":"SPARK-29026","sha":"722a09020a587fb3f55902e9d40e0ba1d7e86bac","user":{"login":"mickjermsurawong-stripe","id":42550941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTUwOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42550941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe","html_url":"https://github.com/mickjermsurawong-stripe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194156930,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQxNTY5MzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"mickjermsurawong-stripe/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mickjermsurawong-stripe","id":42550941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTUwOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42550941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe","html_url":"https://github.com/mickjermsurawong-stripe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mickjermsurawong-stripe/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n    The PR proposes to create a custom `RDD` which enables to propagate `SQLConf` also in cases not tracked by SQL execution, as it happens when a `Dataset` is converted to and RDD either using `.rdd` or `.queryExecution.toRdd` and then the returned RDD is used to invoke actions on it.\r\n    \r\nIn this way, SQL configs are effective also in these cases, while earlier they were ignored.\r\n    \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n    \r\nWithout this patch, all the times `.rdd` or `.queryExecution.toRdd` are used, all the SQL configs set are ignored. An example of a reproducer can be:\r\n```\r\n      withSQLConf(SQLConf.SUBEXPRESSION_ELIMINATION_ENABLED.key, \"false\") {\r\n        val df = spark.range(2).selectExpr((0 to 5000).map(i => s\"id as field_$i\"): _*)\r\n        df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"spark64kb\")\r\n        val data = spark.sql(\"select * from spark64kb limit 10\")\r\n        // Subexpression elimination is used here, despite it should have been disabled\r\n        data.describe()\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this patch, all the times `.rdd` or `.queryExecution.toRdd` are used, all the SQL configs set are ignored.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bug regarding accessing `DStreamCheckpointData.currentCheckpointFiles` without guarding which makes the test `basic rdd checkpoints + dstream graph checkpoint recovery` being flaky.\r\n\r\nThere're two possible points to make test failing:\r\n\r\n1. checkpoint logic is too slow so that checkpoint cannot be handled within real delay\r\n2. There's multithreads-unsafe point in `DStreamCheckpointData.update`: it clears `currentCheckpointFiles` and adds new checkpointFiles. Race condition can happen between main thread for test and JobGenerator's event loop thread.\r\n\r\n`lastProcessedBatch` guarantees that all events for given time are processed, as commented:\r\n`// last batch whose completion,checkpointing and metadata cleanup has been completed`. That means, if we wait for time for exactly same amount as advanced the time in test (multiply of checkpoint interval as well as batch duration) we can expect nothing will happen in DStreamCheckpointData afterwards unless we advance the clock.\r\n\r\nThis patch applies the observation above.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe test is reported as flaky as [SPARK-28214](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28214), and the test code seems unsafe.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT. I've added some debug messages and confirmed no method in DStreamCheckpointData is being called between \"after waiting lastProcessedBatch\" and \"advancing clock\" even I added huge amount of sleep between twos, which avoids race-condition.\r\n\r\nI was also able to make existing test artificially failing (not 100% consistently but high likely) via adding sleep between `currentCheckpointFiles.clear()` and `currentCheckpointFiles ++= checkpointFiles` in `DStreamCheckpointData.update`, and confirmed modified test doesn't fail the test multiple times.","created_at":"2019-09-09T12:18:07Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T23:20:36Z","closed_at":"2019-09-09T22:36:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d26d192adf7948acbd555a3fc68c701a55c12721","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25731/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25731/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25731/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bd8470f1697b59860a286731a999c389f18e751d","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-28214","ref":"SPARK-28214","sha":"bd8470f1697b59860a286731a999c389f18e751d","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor issue mentioned in [SPARK-29022](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29022)\r\nSpark SQL CLI can't use class as serde class in jars add by SQL `ADD JAR`. \r\n\r\nWhen we create table with `serde` class contains by jar added by SQL 'ADD JAR'.\r\nWe can create table with `serde` class construct success since we call `HiveClientImpl.createTable` under `withHiveState` method, it will add `clientLoader.classLoader` to `HiveClientImpl.state.getConf.classLoader`.\r\n\r\nJars added by SQL `ADD JAR` will be add to \r\n1. `sparkSession.sharedState.jarClassLoader`.\r\n2. 'HiveClientLoader.clientLoader.classLoader'\r\n\r\nIn Current spark-sql MODE,  `HiveClientImpl.state`  will use CliSessionState created when initialize \r\nSparkSQLCliDriver,  When we select data from table, it will check `serde` class, when call method `HiveTableScanExec#addColumnMetadataToConf()` to check for table desc serde class. \r\n\r\n```\r\nval deserializer = tableDesc.getDeserializerClass.getConstructor().newInstance()\r\n    deserializer.initialize(hiveConf, tableDesc.getProperties)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`getDeserializer` will  use CliSessionState's hiveConf's classLoader in `Spark SQL CLI` mode.\r\nBut when we call `ADD JAR` in spark, the jar won't be added to `Classloader of  CliSessionState' conf `, then `ClassNotFound` error happen. \r\n\r\nSo we reset `CliSessionState conf's classLoader ` to `sharedState.jarClassLoader` when `sharedState.jarClassLoader` has added jar passed by `HIVEAUXJARS`\r\nThen when we use  `ADD JAR `  to add jar,  jar path will be added to CliSessionState's conf's ClassLoader\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nADD

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI've noticed that there are two functions to sort arrays sort_array and array_sort.\r\n\r\nsort_array is from 1.5.0 and it has the possibility of ordering both ascending and descending \r\n\r\narray_sort is from 2.4.0 and it only has the possibility of ordering in ascending.\r\n\r\nBasically I just added the possibility of ordering either ascending or descending using array_sort. \r\n\r\nI think it would be good to have unified behaviours and not having to user sort_array when you want to order in descending order. \r\nImagine that you are new to spark, I'd like to be able to sort array using the newest spark functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBasically to be able to sort the array in descending order using *array_sort* instead of using *sort_array* from 1.5.0\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, now you are able to sort the array in descending order. Note that it has the same behaviour with nulls than sort_array\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest's added\r\n\r\nThis is the link to the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the flaky test failure from StreamingContextSuite \"stop slow receiver gracefully\", via putting flag whether initializing slow receiver is completed, and wait for such flag to be true. As receiver should be submitted via job and initialized in executor, 500ms might not be enough for covering all cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe got some reports for test failure on this test. Please refer [SPARK-24663](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24663)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT. I've artificially made delay on handling job submission via adding below code in `DAGScheduler.submitJob`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (rdd != null && rdd.name != null && rdd.name.startsWith(\"Receiver\")) {\r\n  println(s\"Receiver Job! rdd name: ${rdd.name}\")\r\n  Thread.sleep(1000)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the test \"stop slow receiver gracefully\" failed on current master and passed on the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome of the columns of JDBC/ODBC server tab in Web UI are hard to understand.\r\nWe have documented it at SPARK-28373 but I think it is better to have some tooltips in the SQL statistics table to explain the columns\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12819544/64489775-38e48980-d257-11e9-868a-5f5f6a0f1e46.png)\r\nThe columns with new tooltips are finish time, close time, execution time and duration\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12819544/64489858-1141f100-d258-11e9-9e4e-fae3299da465.png)\r\nImprovements in UIUtils can be used in other tables in WebUI to add tooltips\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is interesting to improve the undestanding of the WebUI\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests are added and manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe intent to use the --hiveconf/--hivevar parameter is just an initialization value, so setting it once in ```SparkSQLSessionManager#openSession``` is sufficient, and each time the ```SparkExecuteStatementOperation``` setting causes the variable to not be modified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is wrong to set the --hivevar/--hiveconf variable in every ```SparkExecuteStatementOperation```, which prevents variable updates.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n```\r\ncat <<EOF >

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent SparkThriftServer need to fit so much hive version problem and it implement too much unused feature from HiveServer2. Maybe we should implement thrift server  with spark's own code. \r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n1. Construct RowSet with StructType and Row\r\n2. Old Thrift server avoid conflicts, pass a HiveConf for execution, remove all action about HiveMetaStore to class DelegationTokenHandler\r\n3. Remove unnecessary action for Hive execution.\r\n4. Add `hive-service` API code dependency for `beeline`\r\n5. Implement some class to handle version problem such as `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.cli.Type`, `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.utils.LogHelper/VariableSubstitution`\r\n6. Remove class ThrfitserverShimUtils and dir for hive version v1.2.1 & v2.3.5\r\n7. Based on PROTOCOL_VERSION_V9, backwards compatible， when protocol version update, we can just  replace old and  add some more method since protocol is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why

In the case of a Spark DataFrame, null is correct.\r\n\r\nIssue 2 mentioned in JIRA Spark SQL \"desc formatted tablename\" is not showing the header # col_name,data_type,comment , seems to be the header has been removed knowingly as part of SPARK-20954.\r\n\r\nIssue 3: \r\nCorrected the Last Access time, the value shall display 'UNKNOWN' as currently system wont support the last access time evaluation, since hive was setting Last access time as '0' in metastore even though spark CatalogTable last access time value set as -1. this will make the validation logic of LasAccessTime where

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe do semantically equivalent subexpression elimination in SparkSQL. However, for some expressions that are not semantically equivalent, but structurally equivalent, current subexpression elimination generates too many similar functions. These functions share same computation structure but only differ in input slots of current processing row.\r\n\r\nFor example, expression a is input[1] + input[2], expression b is input[3] + input[4]. They are not semantically equivalent in SparkSQL, but they have the same computation on different input data.\r\n\r\nFor such expressions, we can generate just one function, and pass in input slots during runtime.\r\n\r\nIt can reduce the length of generated code text, and save compilation time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor complex query, current sub-expression elimination could generate too many similar functions. It leads long generated code text and increases compilation time.\r\n\r\nFor example, run the following query:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.range(2).selectExpr((0 to 5000).map(i => s\"id as field_$i\"): _*)\r\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"spark64kb\")\r\nval data = spark.sql(\"select * from spark64kb limit 10\")\r\ndata.describe()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe longest compilation time observed in this query is 25816.203394ms. After this patch, the same compilation is reduced to 9143.778397ms.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis doesn't introduce user-facing change.\r\nThis feature is controlled by a SQL config `spark.sql.structuralSubexpressionElimination.enabled`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupported special string values for `TIMESTAMP` type. They are simply notational shorthands that will be converted to ordinary timestamp values when read. The following string values are supported:\r\n- `epoch [zoneId]` - `1970-01-01 00:00:00+00 (Unix system time zero)`\r\n- `today [zoneId]` - midnight today.\r\n- `yesterday [zoneId]` -midnight yesterday\r\n- `tomorrow [zoneId]` - midnight tomorrow\r\n- `now` - current query start time.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT timestamp 'tomorrow';\r\n2019-09-07 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL, see [8.5.1.4. Special Values](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-datetime.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPreviously, the parser fails on the special values with the error:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp 'today';\r\nError in query: \r\nCannot parse the TIMESTAMP value: today(line 1, pos 7)\r\n```\r\nAfter the changes, the special values are converted to appropriate dates:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp 'today';\r\n2019-09-06 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `TimestampFormatterSuite` to check parsing special values from regular strings.\r\n- Tests in `DateTimeUtilsSuite` check parsing those values from `UTF8String`\r\n- Uncommented tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFollow the scala ```OneVsRestParams``` implementation, move ```setClassifier``` from ```OneVsRestParams``` to ```OneVsRest``` in Pyspark\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Maintain the parity between scala and python code. \r\n2. ```Classifier``` can only be set in the estimator.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nPrevious behavior: ```OneVsRestModel``` has method ```setClassifier```\r\nCurrent behavior:  ```setClassifier``` is removed from ```OneVsRestModel```. ```classifier``` can only be set in ```OneVsRest```.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLet us check the nondecimalAndDecimal method in DecimalPrecision class.\r\nWhen there is a BinaryOperator with a nondecimal and decimal, it will process left and right expressions.\r\nWhen the two expressions are float/double and decimal, it will cast decimal to double type.\r\nHowever, this operation may lost decimal precision, even when we set spark.sql.decimalOperations.allowPrecisionLoss=false.\r\nFor example:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6757692/64435215-a75d0680-d0f4-11e9-9367-6c6efe7ab8d2.png)\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I will check whether allow decimal precision loss, if precision loss is not allowed, I will cast the float/double to decimal.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDecimal may lost precision when user don't allow decimal precision loss\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded Unit test.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to resolve the time zone before inlining tables in the Analyzer. The former rules uses `Cast` there: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e6e9031d7b7458c9d88205d06cdcdd95a98b9537/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/ResolveInlineTables.scala#L101-L103\r\nwhich can require the time zone in some cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, `SQLQueryTestSuite`/`window.sql` failed here https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25708#issuecomment-528818439 because of the reason with the error:\r\n```\r\nError in query: failed to evaluate expression CAST('2017-08-01' AS DATE): None.get; line 1 pos 59\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr proposes to define an individual method for each common subexpression in HashAggregateExec. In the current master, the common subexpr elimination code in HashAggregateExec is expanded in a single method; https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4664a082c2c7ac989e818958c465c72833d3ccfe/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/HashAggregateExec.scala#L397\r\n\r\nThe method size can be too big for JIT compilation, so I believe splitting it is beneficial for performance.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch enforces tests to prevent leaking newly created SparkContext while is created via initializing StreamingContext. Leaking SparkContext in test would make most of following tests being failed as well, so this patch applies defensive programming, trying its best to ensure SparkContext is cleaned up.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe got some case in CI build where SparkContext is being leaked and other tests are affected by leaked SparkContext. Ideally we should isolate the environment among tests if possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupported special string values for `DATE` type. They are simply notational shorthands that will be converted to ordinary date values when read. The following string values are supported:\r\n- `epoch [zoneId]` - `1970-01-01`\r\n- `today [zoneId]` - the current date in the time zone specified by `spark.sql.session.timeZone`.\r\n- `yesterday [zoneId]` - the current date -1\r\n- `tomorrow [zoneId]` - the current date + 1\r\n- `now` - the date of running the current query. It has the same notion as `today`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT date 'tomorrow' - date 'yesterday';\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL, see [8.5.1.4. Special Values](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-datetime.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPreviously, the parser fails on the special values with the error:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date 'today';\r\nError in query: \r\nCannot parse the DATE value: today(line 1, pos 7)\r\n```\r\nAfter the changes, the special values are converted to appropriate dates:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date 'today';\r\n2019-09-06\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `DateFormatterSuite` to check parsing special values from regular strings.\r\n- Tests in `DateTimeUtilsSuite` check parsing those values from `UTF8String`\r\n- Uncommented tests in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr proposes to add explicit casts for generated JDBC partition string literals. In the current master, that logic depends on implicit casts of datasource DBMSs. For example;\r\n```\r\n// This assumes we have a relation testdb(t timestamp) in PostgreSQL\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n  .option(\"url\", \"jdbc:postgresql...\")\r\n  .option(\"dbtable\", \"testdb\")\r\n  .option(\"partitionColumn\", \"t\")\r\n  .option(\"lowerBound\", \"1972-07-04 03:30:00\")\r\n  .option(\"upperBound\", \"1972-07-27 14:11:05\")\r\n  .option(\"numPartitions\", 2)\r\n  .load()\r\n```\r\nThe query above generates  `\"t\" < '1972-07-15 20:50:32.5' or \"t\" is null\"` and `\"t\" >= '1972-07-15 20:50:32.5'` internally for where clauses. Since `t` is timestamp, the clauses depend on implicit casts of PostgreSQL. The current one looks ok in most databases, but I believe explicit casts are more reasonable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo support JDBC partitioning broadly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch ensures accessing recorded values in listener is always after letting listeners fully process all events. To ensure this, this patch adds new class to hide these values and access with methods which will ensure above condition. Without this guard, two threads are running concurrently - 1) listeners process thread 2) test main thread - and race condition would occur.\r\n\r\nThat's why we also see very odd thing, error message saying condition is met but test failed:\r\n```\r\n- Barrier task failures from the same stage attempt don't trigger multiple stage retries *** FAILED ***\r\n  ArrayBuffer(0) did not equal List(0) (DAGSchedulerSuite.scala:2656)\r\n```\r\nwhich means verification failed, and condition is met just before constructing error message.\r\n\r\nThe guard is properly placed in many spots, but missed in some places. This patch enforces that it can't be missed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUT fails intermittently and this patch will address the flakyness.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT. \r\n\r\nAlso made the flaky tests artificially failing via applying 50ms of sleep on each onXXX method. \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-07 at 7 44 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/64465178-1747ad00-d146-11e9-92f6-f4ed4a1f4b08.png)\r\n\r\nI found 3 methods being failed. (They've marked as X. Just ignore ! as they failed on waiting listener in given timeout and these tests don't deal with these recorded values - it uses other timeout value 1000ms than 10000ms for this listener so affected via side-effect.)\r\n\r\nWhen I applied same in this patch all tests marked as X passed.","created_at":"2019-09-06T01:00:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T22:40:04Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T17:25:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba081a2c75c6a722fdfc26abcf058357e5472cac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDuring Spark History Server startup, there are two things happening simultaneously that call into `java.nio.file.FileSystems.getDefault()` and we sometime hit [JDK-8194653](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8194653).\r\n1) start jetty server\r\n2) start ApplicationHistoryProvider (which reads files from HDFS)\r\n\r\nWe should do these two things sequentially instead of in parallel.\r\nWe introduce a start() method in ApplicationHistoryProvider (and its subclass FsHistoryProvider), and we do initialize inside the start() method instead of the constructor.\r\nIn HistoryServer, we explicitly call provider.start() after we call bind() which starts the Jetty server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is a bug that occasionally starting Spark History Server results in process hang due to deadlock among threads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI stress tested this PR with a bash script to stop and start Spark History Server more than 1000 times, it worked fine. Previously I can only do the stop/start loop less than 10 times before I hit the deadlock issue.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-06T00:53:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-14T04:09:25Z","closed_at":"2019-09-14T04:09:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79baf8161818ab0e1b7557121f5c48bf9962d281","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to avoid AQE regressions by avoiding changing a sort merge join to a broadcast hash join when the expected build plan has a high ratio of empty partitions, in which case sort merge join can actually perform faster. This PR achieves this by adding an internal join hint in order to let the planner know which side has this high ratio of empty partitions and it should avoid planning it as a build plan of a BHJ. Still, it won't affect the other side if the other side qualifies for a build plan of a BHJ.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is a performance improvement for AQE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-05T22:48:42Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:26:04Z","closed_at":"2019-09-06T19:47:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6745c13438a94c72d139d460d384e8a0fc82271","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25703/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25703/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25703/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b011ab3570f3d9ae3f30e88987cd05a47ec1a87","head":{"label":"maryannxue:aqe-demote-bhj","ref":"aqe-demote-bhj","sha":"4b011ab3570f3d9ae3f30e88987cd05a47ec1a87","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25158 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25458, SQL features of PostgreSQL are introduced into Spark. AFAIK, both features are implementation-defined behaviors, which are not specified in ANSI SQL.\r\nIn such a case, this proposal is to add a configuration `spark.sql.dialect` for choosing a database dialect.\r\nAfter this PR, Spark supports two database dialects, `Spark` and `PostgreSQL`. With `PostgreSQL` dialect, Spark will: \r\n1. perform integral division with the / operator if both sides are integral types; \r\n2. accept \"true\", \"yes\", \"1\", \"false\", \"no\", \"0\", and unique prefixes as input and trim input for the boolean data type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnify the external database dialect with one configuration, instead of small flags.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nA new configuration `spark.sql.dialect` for choosing a database dialect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2019-09-05T15:11:04Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T13:00:42Z","closed_at":"2019-09-26T13:00:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"819cb00bac61a1fbbe773fa42c39799d0eb2ecf9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25697/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25697/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25697/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/75aeda757b10b8601cb386a53a87d888fc6556e1","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:dialect","ref":"dialect","sha":"75aeda757b10b8601cb386a53a87d888fc6556e1","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add new tests to test the username of HiveClient to prevent changing the semantic unintentionally. The owner of Hive table has been changed back-and-forth, principal -> username -> principal, and looks like the change is not intentional. (Please refer [SPARK-28996](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28996) for more details.) This patch intends to prevent this.\r\n\r\nThis patch also renames previous HiveClientSuite(s) to HivePartitionFilteringSuite(s) as it was commented as TODO, as well as previous tests are too narrowed to test only partition filtering.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNewly added UTs.","created_at":"2019-09-05T12:32:18Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T06:32:39Z","closed_at":"2019-09-17T06:04:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b8651a874dcb5fb3f33078e417a9f687835e83f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25696/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25696/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25696/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef220efecf44a4b569de9e5a8a8147170692954f","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-28996","ref":"SPARK-28996","sha":"ef220efecf44a4b569de9e5a8a8147170692954f","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, there are new configurations for compatibility with ANSI SQL:\r\n\r\n* `spark.sql.parser.ansi.enabled`\r\n* `spark.sql.decimalOperations.nullOnOverflow`\r\n* `spark.sql.failOnIntegralTypeOverflow`\r\nThis PR is to add new configuration `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` and remove the 3 options above. When the configuration is true, Spark tries to conform to the ANSI SQL specification. It will be disabled by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake it simple and straightforward.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe new features for ANSI compatibility will be set via one configuration `spark.sql.ansi.enabled`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2019-09-05T08:45:52Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T20:27:07Z","closed_at":"2019-09-19T05:30:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f7a95be1dc836b9c91b66cd6600d07c4e7e7c7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25693/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25693/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25693/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3a0745595d2aa1964bc23bc1415b90a4c7d52d26","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:ansiEnabled","ref":"ansiEnabled","sha":"3a0745595d2aa1964bc23bc1415b90a4c7d52d26","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeparate the logic for V2 Catalog lookup from table lookup. Catalog lookups are performed through separate extractors. Then table lookups are performed and we make a decision on whether we want to go the V1 code path or the V2 code path.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make it easier in the future to remove the V1 code paths and have a better separation of concerns in the code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests are quite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Remove SQLContext.createExternalTable and Catalog.createExternalTable, deprecated in favor of createTable since 2.2.0, plus tests of deprecated methods\r\n- Remove HiveContext, deprecated in 2.0.0, in favor of `SparkSession.builder.enableHiveSupport`\r\n- Remove deprecated KinesisUtils.createStream methods, plus tests of deprecated methods, deprecate in 2.2.0\r\n- Remove deprecated MLlib (not Spark ML) linear method support, mostly utility constructors and 'train' methods, and associated docs. This includes methods in LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, Lasso, RidgeRegression. These have been deprecated since 2.0.0\r\n- Remove deprecated Pyspark MLlib linear method support, including LogisticRegressionWithSGD, LinearRegressionWithSGD, LassoWithSGD\r\n- Remove 'runs' argument in KMeans.train() method, which has been a no-op since 2.0.0\r\n- Remove deprecated ChiSqSelector isSorted protected method\r\n- Remove deprecated 'yarn-cluster' and 'yarn-client' master argument in favor of 'yarn' and deploy mode 'cluster', etc\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- I was not able to remove deprecated DataFrameReader.json(RDD) in favor of DataFrameReader.json(Dataset); the former was deprecated in 2.2.0, but, it is still needed to support Pyspark's .json() method, which can't use a Dataset.\r\n- Looks like SQLContext.createExternalTable was not actually deprecated in Pyspark, but, almost certainly was meant to be? Catalog.createExternalTable was.\r\n- I afterwards noted that the toDegrees, toRadians functions were almost removed fully in SPARK-25908, but Felix suggested keeping just the R version as they hadn't been technically deprecated. I'd like to revisit that. Do we really want the inconsistency? I'm not against reverting it again, but then that implies leaving SQLContext.createExternalTable just in Pyspark too, which seems weird.\r\n- I *kept* LogisticRegressionWithSGD, LinearRegressionWithSGD, LassoWithSGD, RidgeRegressionWithSGD in Pyspark, though deprecated, as it is hard to remove them (still used by StreamingLogisticRegressionWithSGD?) and they are not fully removed in Scala. Maybe should not have been deprecated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDeprecated items are easiest to remove in a major release, so we should do so as much as possible for Spark 3. This does not target items deprecated 'recently' as of Spark 2.3, which is still 18 months old.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, in that deprecated items are removed from some public APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2019-09-04T22:50:31Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T04:33:19Z","closed_at":"2019-09-09T15:19:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d68e68a4d8d2ab0e92e4269dc8bd42c765a3f976","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new write API as proposed in the [SPIP to standardize logical plans](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23521). This new API:\r\n\r\n* Uses clear verbs to execute writes, like `append`, `overwrite`, `create`, and `replace` that correspond to the new logical plans.\r\n* Only creates v2 logical plans so the behavior is always consistent.\r\n* Does not allow table configuration options for operations that cannot change table configuration. For example, `partitionedBy` can only be called when the writer executes `create` or `replace`.\r\n\r\nHere are a few example uses of the new API:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").append()\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").overwrite($\"date\" === \"2019-06-01\")\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").overwritePartitions()\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").asParquet.create()\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").partitionedBy(days($\"ts\")).createOrReplace()\r\ndf.writeTo(\"catalog.db.table\").using(\"abc\").replace()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded `DataFrameWriterV2Suite` that tests the new write API. Existing tests for v2 plans.","created_at":"2019-09-04T19:43:11Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T22:42:19Z","closed_at":"2019-09-19T20:32:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89c40cf05ad2f7117b4049710c85dc3d466f1861","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ab7c3e89888d5233cefe64a8a91789e8e7a5504f","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-28612-add-data-frame-writer-v2","ref":"SPARK-28612-add-data-frame-writer-v2","sha":"ab7c3e89888d5233cefe64a8a91789e8e7a5504f","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse `KeyLock` added in #25612 to simplify `MapOutputTracker.getStatuses`. It also has some improvement after the refactoring:\r\n- `InterruptedException` is no longer sallowed.\r\n- When a shuffle block is fetched, we don't need to wake up unrelated sleeping threads.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`MapOutputTracker.getStatuses` is pretty hard to maintain right now because it has a special lock mechanism which we needs to pay attention to whenever updating this method. As we can use `KeyLock` to hide the complexity of locking behind a dedicated lock class, it's better to refactor it to make it easy to understand and maintain.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-04T16:56:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T06:21:08Z","closed_at":"2019-09-05T06:20:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"564bb3570d0b7ee45f70fd360eac676a144aef3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nmerge the `V2WriteSupportCheck` and `V2StreamingScanSupportCheck` to one rule: `TableCapabilityCheck`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a little confusing to have 2 rules to check DS v2 table capability, while one rule says it checks write and another rule says it checks streaming scan. We can clearly tell it from the rule names that the batch scan check is missing.\r\n\r\nIt's better to have a centralized place for this check, with a name that clearly says it checks table capability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProposed new type for Catalyst's type system to represent local time. According to the SQL standard, a value of data type `TIME` comprises values of the datetime fields HOUR, MINUTE and SECOND. It is always a valid time of day.\r\n\r\n- `HOUR` - hour within day, between 00 and 23\r\n- `MINUTE` - minute within hour, between 00 and 59\r\n- `SECOND` - second and possibly fraction of a second within minute. Valid range is 0-59.999999\r\n\r\nInternally, the `TIME` type is implemented as Catalyst `TimeType` and stores a number of microseconds since `00:00:00.000000`.\r\n\r\nThe java class `java.time.LocalTime` was supported as the external type for `TimeType`. So, instances of `java.time.LocalTime` can be parallelized and converted to values of `TimeType`, and collected back to instances of `LocalTime` as well. Spark also accepts literals of `TimeType` with values of `LocalTime`.\r\n\r\nCreated an encoder that serializes instances of the `java.time.LocalTime` classto the internal representation of nullable Catalyst's `TimeType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* To maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which supports the `TIME` type and its constructor `make_time`. The former function is commented in `date.sql` at the moment: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3a4afce96c6840431ed45280742f9e969be19639/sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/inputs/pgSQL/date.sql#L353\r\n\r\n* To be compliant with the SQL standard\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe PR extends existing functionality. So, users can parallelize instances of the `java.time.LocalTime` class and collect them back:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nscala> val ds = Seq(java.time.LocalTime.of(20, 38, 10)).toDS\r\nds: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[java.time.LocalTime] = [value: time]\r\nscala> ds.collect\r\nres5: Array[java.time.LocalTime] = Array(20:38:10)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added a few tests to `CatalystTypeConvertersSuite` to check conversion from/to `java.time.LocalTime`.\r\n- Checking row encoding by new tests in `RowEncoderSuite`.\r\n- Making literals of `TimeType` is tested in `LiteralExpressionSuite`\r\n- Check collecting by `DatasetSuite` and `JavaDatasetSuite`.","created_at":"2019-09-04T13:22:09Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T15:47:34Z","closed_at":"2019-09-15T08:14:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdff9475529fb30a169bbf7aae820e6b78a18674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bd6b976b06a16b968b744fc4c11c6ac2f3999790","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:time-type","ref":"time-type","sha":"bd6b976b06a16b968b744fc4c11c6ac2f3999790","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIf a Spark task is killed due to intentional job kills, automated killing of redundant speculative tasks, etc, ClosedByInterruptException occurs if task has unfinished I/O operation with AbstractInterruptibleChannel. A single cancelled task can result in hundreds of stack trace of ClosedByInterruptException being logged. \r\nIn this PR, stack trace of ClosedByInterruptException won't be logged like Executor.run do for InterruptedException.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nLarge numbers of spurious exceptions is confusing to users when they are inspecting Spark logs to diagnose other issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nN/A","created_at":"2019-09-04T07:05:49Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T10:28:58Z","closed_at":"2019-09-09T10:28:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"975bb7bb6d04383bb65a2bfca59b5873593e370c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ReplayListenerSuite` depends on a listener class to listen for replayed events. This class was implemented by extending `EventLoggingListener`. `EventLoggingListener` does not log executor metrics update events, but uses them to update internal state; on a stage completion event, it then logs stage executor metrics events using this internal state. As executor metrics update events do not get written to the event log, they do not get replayed. The internal state of the replay listener can therefore be different from the original listener, leading to different stage completion events being logged.\r\n\r\nWe reimplement the replay listener to simply buffer each and every event it receives. This makes it a simpler yet better tool for verifying the events that get sent through the ReplayListenerBus.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs explained above. Tests sometimes fail due to events being received by the `EventLoggingListener` that do not get logged (and thus do not get replayed) but influence other events that get logged.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-04T04:30:44Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T20:56:20Z","closed_at":"2019-09-05T20:55:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"41d4d6d745c1e9a06c129320a3a6a61d41686f8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is a part of [SPARK-28594](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28594) and design doc for SPARK-28594 is linked here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bdCC4nA58uveRxpeo8k7kGOI2NRTXmXyBOweSi4YcY/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes adding new feature to event logging, rolling event log files via configured file size.\r\n\r\nPreviously event logging is done with single file and related codebase (`EventLoggingListener`/`FsHistoryProvider`) is tightly coupled with it. This patch adds layer on both reader (`EventLogFileReader`) and writer (`EventLogFileWriter`) to decouple implementation details between \"handling events\" and \"how to read/write events from/to file\".\r\n\r\nThis patch adds two properties, `spark.eventLog.rollLog` and `spark.eventLog.rollLog.maxFileSize` which provides configurable behavior of rolling log. The feature is disabled by default, as we only expect huge event log for huge/long-running application. For other cases single event log file would be sufficient and still simpler.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a part of SPARK-28594 which addresses event log growing infinitely for long-running application.\r\n\r\nThis patch itself also provides some option for the situation where event log file gets huge and consume their storage. End users may give up replaying their events and want to delete the event log file, but given application is still running and writing the file, it's not safe to delete the file. End users will be able to delete some of old files after applying rolling over event log.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as the new feature is turned off by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests, as well as basic manual tests.\r\n\r\nBasic manual tests - ran SHS, ran structured streaming query with roll event log enabled, verified split files are generated as well as SHS can load these files, with handling app status as incomplete/complete.","created_at":"2019-09-03T21:42:34Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T05:41:51Z","closed_at":"2019-10-17T18:15:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"567cde39f9b3b0d5660d53311c979e9443f02d8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLambda functions to array `filter` can now take as input the index as well as the element. This behavior matches array `transform`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSee JIRA. It's generally useful, and particularly so if you're working with fixed length arrays.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nPreviously filter lambdas had to look like\r\n`filter(arr, el -> whatever)`\r\n\r\nNow, lambdas can take an index argument as well\r\n`filter(array, (el, idx) -> whatever)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added unit tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, remove setters generated by _shared_params_code_gen.py;\r\n2, add common abstract classes like the side side, such as JavaPredictor/JavaClassificationModel/JavaProbabilisticClassifier;\r\n3, for each alg, add its param trait, such as LinearSVCParams;\r\n4, since sharedParam do not have setters, we need to add them in right places;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nyes, some methods in estimators and models in the py side are changed\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI test them in pyspark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR allows `bin/spark-submit --version` to show the correct information while the previous versions, which were created by `dev/create-release/do-release-docker.sh`, show incorrect information.\r\n\r\nThere are two root causes to show incorrect information:\r\n\r\n1. Did not pass `USER` environment variable to the docker container\r\n1. Did not keep `.git` directory in the work directory\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe information is missing while the previous versions show the correct information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[28954](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28954#)  \r\n\r\nFor extra jar passed through hive conf  `HiveConf.ConfVars.HIVEAUXJARS`, we don't need to use complex APIs to fix different hive version problem, we just can handle it through spark's SessionResourceLoader's API. add jar to Spark and SparkSession's  running env.\r\n\r\n\r\n For problem mentioned in  #25542 , the root cause is :\r\nIn SparkSQLCliDriver, we will create a CliSessionState, then we will call\r\n`SessionState.start(sessionState)`, this method will do like blow in SessionState.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46485123/64145309-d2243200-ce4a-11e9-8c5f-89bc651443e8.png)\r\n\r\nThen currentThread's ClassLoader will be replaced by hiveConf's ClassLoader, then cause problem mentioned in #25542 .\r\n\r\nFix it by add origin thread's ClassLoader to CliSessionState's conf's ClassLoader before we call\r\n`SessionState.start(sessionState)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce complex code to fit each version of hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisted UT is enough\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-02T16:10:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T11:08:44Z","closed_at":"2019-09-12T11:08:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c7fc36920e3260c3dbd185c921966fd7ee9c320","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d32ea36f3cd05016854fbf421881559fc405a26","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:FLLOW_UP_SPARK-28840","ref":"FLLOW_UP_SPARK-28840","sha":"2d32ea36f3cd05016854fbf421881559fc405a26","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr refines the code of DELETE, including, 1, make `whereClause` to be optional, in which case DELETE will delete all of the data of a table; 2, add more test cases; 3, some other refines.\r\nThis is a following-up of SPARK-28351.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAn optional where clause in DELETE respects the SQL standard.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.

For example, users can plug in a cassandra catalog, and use Spark to read/write cassandra tables directly.\r\n2. users read/write the external data as a table directly via `DataFrameReader/Writer`, or register it as a table in Spark.\r\n\r\nUse case 1 is newly introduced in the master branch, which greatly improves the user experience when interacting with external storage systems that have catalogs, e.g. cassandra, JDBC, etc.\r\n\r\nUse case 2 is the main use case of Data Source V1, which works well if the external storage system doesn't have a catalog, e.g. parquet files on S3.\r\n\r\nHowever, use case 2 is not well supported. For example\r\n```\r\nclass MyTableProvider extends TableProvider ...\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t USING com.abc.MyTableProvider\")\r\n```\r\nThis fails with `AnalysisException: com.abc.MyTableProvider is not a valid Spark SQL Data Source`. The session catalog always treats table provider as v1 source.\r\n\r\nTo support it, this PR updates `TableProvider#getTable` to accept additional table metadata info. The expected behaviors are defined in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaS0eIVL1WsCjr4CqIpRv6CGkS5EoMQrngn3FsY1d-Q/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds three more information:\r\n\r\n- Mentions that `bash` in `PATH` to build is required.\r\n- Specifies supported JDK and Maven versions\r\n- Explicitly mentions that building on Windows is not the official support\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to make SparkR developers on Windows able to work, and describe what is needed for AppVeyor build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. It just adds some information in `R/WINDOWS.md`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is already being tested as so in AppVeyor. Also, I tested as so (long ago though).\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-02T04:23:42Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:18:11Z","closed_at":"2019-09-03T06:08:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef453565bc74b9d8b9f6cc00bd752d224219733b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARKR","name":"SPARKR","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627011,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MDEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCUMENTATION","name":"DOCUMENTATION","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3c0f92cf71d49ebb6f4060453a38e8bb768b82c2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-28946","ref":"SPARK-28946","sha":"3c0f92cf71d49ebb6f4060453a38e8bb768b82c2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
