PR fixes [`GROOVY-10503`](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-10503).\r\n\r\nASM 9.2 is compatible with Java 18. So now when compiling under Java 16+, the compiler will be able to successfully analyse JDK or library files with class file versions 60-62. This helps to avoid errors coming from `groovyjarjarasm.asm.ClassReader` like:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nIllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 61\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing system property `groovy.target.bytecode`, e.g. setting it to `1.8` or `11`, users can of course still compile scripts to lower byte code versions than the current JRE, but at least the compiler does not trip over those JRE files with more recent class file versions anymore.","created_at":"2022-02-22T04:56:15Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T20:43:18Z","closed_at":"2022-05-12T20:43:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7b9c5cabecc492f35f8e5f8b67728b77db29d69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/1cf4a5379aa5551f38865e9727bde45235b9b144","head":{"label":"kriegaex:asm-9.2","ref":"asm-9.2","sha":"1cf4a5379aa5551f38865e9727bde45235b9b144","user":{"login":"kriegaex","id":1537384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzczODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegaex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":462120472,"node_id":"R_kgDOG4tmGA","name":"groovy","full_name":"kriegaex/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kriegaex","id":1537384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzczODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegaex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kriegaex/groovy","description":"Apache

default values, I want to use `map.containsKey(name) ? map.name : defaultValue` instead of `map.name ?: defaultValue` -- in case `null` or `0` or another falsy value is supplied.  This change does not give the map a chance to supply a default value, but I thought that was okay in order to allow user to supply falsy value explicitly.\r\n\r\nOne case that was hard to understand comes form the `record` tests.  The example has `null` passed for an `int` and results in `0` whereas this code produces a cast exception.  I wanted to understand if that was desired or just a happy accident.\r\n```groovy\r\nassert new ColoredPoint(x: 0, y: null).toString() == 'ColoredPoint[x=0, y=0, color=white]'\r\n```\r\n\r\nA null test could be inserted for primitives, but it would be more complex and would probably mean one of the operands was evaluated twice.

`NamedParam` annotations in a `NamedParams` container is straightforward.  ~For default values, I wanted to use `map.containsKey(name) ? map.name : defaultValue` instead of `map.name ? map.name :

This change does not give the map a chance to supply a default value, but I thought that was okay in order to allow user to supply falsy value explicitly.~\r\n\r\n~@paulk-asert  One case that was hard to understand comes form the `record` tests.

stopped short of `collectEntries` methods.  They don't have quite the same problem -- map return is probably okay, whereas the distinction between set, list and collection is often important.\r\n\r\nI also changed the return type of some variants to List and added the Collection bridges.\r\n\r\nThere is some inconsistency between some the variations.  In cases where the input and output types are different, collect (except map variant) is listing the input type first where collectMany and others list input type(s) second.  I did not make any changes (except to use `E` instead of `S`).\r\n```java\r\n    <E, T> List<T> collect(E[] self, @ClosureParams(FirstParam.Component.class) Closure<T> transform)\r\n    <T, K, V>

So these still go through the slow
