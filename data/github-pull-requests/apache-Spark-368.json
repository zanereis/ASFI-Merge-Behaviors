What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis follow-up PR is to address the remaining comments in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12385\n\nThe major change in this PR is to issue better error messages in PySpark by using the mechanism that was proposed by @davies in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/7135\n\nFor example, in PySpark, if we input the following statement:\n\n``` python\n>>> l = [('Alice', 1)]\n>>> df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(l)\n>>> df.createTempView(\"people\")\n>>> df.createTempView(\"people\")\n```\n\nBefore this PR, the exception we will get is like \n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/Users/xiaoli/IdeaProjects/sparkDelivery/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line 152, in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe JIRAs under https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14118 remove the support of the DDL/CLI commands that are not natively supported by Spark. However, in Spark-SQL CLI, we still delegate the CLI commands to Hive command processors. To be consistent, we should also remove the related command supports in Spark SQL CLI.\n\nAlso, we need to improve Parser to issue better error exception messages for these unsupported operations.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nLike `Set` Command in Hive, `Reset` is also supported by Hive. See the link: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli \n\nBelow is the related Hive JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3202\n\nThis PR is to implement such a command for resetting the SQL-related configuration to the default values. One of the use case shown in HIVE-3202 is listed below:\n\n> For the purpose of optimization we set various configs per query. It's worthy but all those configs should be reset every time for next query.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test

Then, `newSparkSQLSpecificMetastoreTable`is invoked to create the `CatalogTable`before asking HiveClient to create the metastore table. In this call, `locationURI`is not set. So when we convert `CatalogTable` to HiveTable before passing to Hive Metastore, hive table's data location is not set. Then, Hive metastore implicitly creates a data location as <hive warehouse>/tableName, which is, `file:/user/hive/warehouse/spark_15269` in the above case. \n\nWhen dropping the table, hive does not delete this implicitly created path because the table is external.\n\nwhen we create the 2nd table with select and without a path, the table is created as managed table, provided a default path in the options as following:\n\n```\nval optionsWithPath =\n      if (!new CaseInsensitiveMap(options).contains(\"path\")) {\n        isExternal = false\n        options + (\"path\" -> sessionState.catalog.defaultTablePath(tableIdent))\n      } else {\n        options\n      }\n```\n\nThis default path happens to be the hive's warehouse directory + the table name, which is the same as the one hive metastore implicitly created earlier for the 1st table.  So when trying to write the provided data to this data source table by `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation`, which complains about the path existence since the SaveMode is SaveMode.ErrorIfExists.\n### Solution:\n\nWhen creating an external datasource table that is non-hive compatible, make sure we set the provided path to `CatalogTable.storage.locationURI`, so we avoid hive metastore from implicitly creating a data location for the table.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTestcase is added. And run regtest.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt seems `unionAll(other: Dataset[T])` and `registerTempTable(tableName: String)` are deprecated but it seems they are still being used across Spark tests.\n\nIn Scala/Java, it seems only `registerTempTable(tableName: String)` is being used. This PR replaces `registerTempTable(tableName: String)` to `createOrReplaceTempView(viewName: String)`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests. Existing tests should cover this.\n","created_at":"2016-05-14T10:07:17Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:20Z","closed_at":"2016-05-16T03:27:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"203dac9b66d0eee068c1e115086685244d65e1b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4b41c596fa9d95282633694508c4a910418a4ba","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-15325","ref":"SPARK-15325","sha":"d4b41c596fa9d95282633694508c4a910418a4ba","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n~~Although overriding `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` in the spark-sql cli, the metastore warehouse directory still uses the default value of `spark.sql.warehouse.dir`. This is a regression. It works in the previous release.~~\n\nMultiple test suites are still using `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` as the input parameters to the Thrift Server or Spark-SQL Cli. Before this PR, this parameter is simply ignored without any message. However, these parameters took effect to change the default location of database in warehouse until Spark 2.0.0. \n\nTo ensure users correctly use the new parameter, this PR is to issue an exception if users specify the parm: `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` in Thrift-Server and Spark SQL CLI:\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.Error: hive.metastore.warehouse.dir is deprecated. Instead, use spark.sql.warehouse.dir to specify the default location of database.\n```\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing and also added a test in `CliSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-05-14T04:30:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T21:19:55Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T21:19:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f97c7fa68208302be8fa49638434adaaccb057b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29c937332732c66007a23e951318155fb8eb1ae4","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:stopCli","ref":"stopCli","sha":"29c937332732c66007a23e951318155fb8eb1ae4","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

As discussed in SPARK-15237, I think the better approach is to separate out the DataFrame stats function instead of putting everything on one page.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix `MapObjects.itemAccessorMethod` to handle `TimestampType`. Without this fix, `Array[Timestamp]` cannot be properly encoded or decoded. To reproduce this, in `ExpressionEncoderSuite`, if you add the following test case:\n\n`encodeDecodeTest(Array(Timestamp.valueOf(\"2016-01-29 10:00:00\")), \"array of timestamp\") \n`\n... you will see that (without this fix) it fails with the following output:\n\n```\n- encode/decode for array of timestamp: [Ljava.sql.Timestamp;@fd9ebde *** FAILED ***\n  Exception thrown while decoding\n  Converted: [0,1000000010,800000001,52a7ccdc36800]\n  Schema: value#61615\n  root\n  -- value: array (nullable = true)\n      |-- element: timestamp (containsNull = true)\n  Encoder:\n  class[value[0]:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, listing files is very slow if there is thousands files, especially on local file system, because:\n1) FileStatus.getPermission() is very slow on local file system, which is launch a subprocess and parse the stdout.\n2) Create an JobConf is very expensive (ClassUtil.findContainingJar() is slow).\n\nThis PR improve these by:\n1) Use another constructor of LocatedFileStatus to avoid calling FileStatus.getPermission, the permissions are not used for data sources.\n2) Only create an JobConf once within one task.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tests on a partitioned table with 1828 partitions, decrease the time to load the table from 22 seconds to 1.6 seconds (Most of time are spent in merging schema now).\n","created_at":"2016-05-13T07:08:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T10:49:05Z","closed_at":"2016-05-18T10:49:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17c1900384841c77687d0d765e5168f8bee1af07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/afc58d309451739f4c8159a5bad961114fee9988","head":{"label":"davies:listing","ref":"listing","sha":"afc58d309451739f4c8159a5bad961114fee9988","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSo far, when using In-Memory Catalog, we allow DDL operations for the tables. However, the corresponding DML operations are not supported for the tables that are neither temporary nor data source tables. For example, \n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE tabName(i INT, j STRING)\nSELECT * FROM tabName\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tabName SELECT 1, 'a'\n```\n\nIn the above example, before this PR fix, we will get very confusing exception messages for either `SELECT` or `INSERT`\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: unresolved operator 'SimpleCatalogRelation default, CatalogTable(`default`.`tbl`,CatalogTableType(MANAGED),CatalogStorageFormat(None,Some(org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat),Some(org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat),None,false,Map()),List(CatalogColumn(i,int,true,None), CatalogColumn(j,string,true,None)),List(),List(),List(),-1,,1463928681802,-1,Map(),None,None,None,List()), None;\n```\n\nThis PR is to issue appropriate exceptions in this case. The message will be like \n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Please enable Hive support when operating non-temporary tables: `tbl`; \n```\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR change REPL/Main to check this property `spark.sql.catalogImplementation` to decide if `enableHiveSupport`should be called. \n\nIf `spark.sql.catalogImplementation` is set to `hive`, and hive classes are built, Spark will use Hive support.\nOther wise, Spark will create a SparkSession with in-memory catalog support.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRun the REPL component test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds support for a few SQL functions to improve compatibility with other databases: IFNULL, NULLIF, NVL and NVL2. In order to do this, this patch introduced a RuntimeReplaceable expression trait that allows replacing an unevaluable expression in the optimizer before evaluation.\n\nNote that the semantics are not completely identical to other databases in esoteric cases.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a new test suite SQLCompatibilityFunctionSuite.\n\nCloses #12373.\n","created_at":"2016-05-12T23:50:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T05:53:50Z","closed_at":"2016-05-13T05:20:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f3e08cd85bfb21fb087bc7b5dd0d2d96265e7cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3248fb5f10e1ae44328450587044c29eeef21d62","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14541","ref":"SPARK-14541","sha":"3248fb5f10e1ae44328450587044c29eeef21d62","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe command `SET -v` always outputs the default values even if we set the parameter. This behavior is incorrect. Instead, if users override it, we should output the user-specified value.\n\nIn addition, the output schema of `SET -v` is wrong. We should use the column `value` instead of `default` for the parameter value.\n\nThis PR is to fix the above two issues. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a follow-up of #12781. It adds native `SHOW CREATE TABLE` support for Hive tables and views. A new field `hasUnsupportedFeatures` is added to `CatalogTable` to indicate whether all table metadata retrieved from the concrete underlying external catalog (i.e. Hive metastore in this case) can be mapped to fields in `CatalogTable`. This flag is useful when the target Hive table contains structures that can't be handled by Spark SQL, e.g., skewed columns and storage handler, etc..\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test cases are added in `ShowCreateTableSuite` to do round-trip tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-12T15:34:19Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T14:15:04Z","closed_at":"2016-05-17T22:58:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"478f8a335889637c984b120042392834a0031d63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13079/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13079/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13079/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/74fd5d342459e844bc41ed86ef9bf04d7d092b3e","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14346-show-create-table-for-hive-tables","ref":"spark-14346-show-create-table-for-hive-tables","sha":"74fd5d342459e844bc41ed86ef9bf04d7d092b3e","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n\"DESCRIBE table\" is broken when table schema is stored at key \"spark.sql.sources.schema\".\n\nOriginally, we used spark.sql.sources.schema to store the schema of a data source table.\nAfter SPARK-6024, we removed this flag. Although we are not using spark.sql.sources.schema any more, we need to still support it.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test.\n\nWhen using spark2.0 to load a table generated by spark 1.2.\nBefore change: \n`DESCRIBE table` => Schema of this table is inferred at runtime,,\n\nAfter change:\n`DESCRIBE table` => correct output.\n","created_at":"2016-05-12T08:53:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T02:43:30Z","closed_at":"2016-05-16T02:43:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0587c911bf6be9f40d4ae05a1cffb2c60f17bafb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f82f7c609d3ba69580c4531f348dd6d87f804c2c","head":{"label":"clockfly:spark-15253","ref":"spark-15253","sha":"f82f7c609d3ba69580c4531f348dd6d87f804c2c","user":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57937220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzkzNzIyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"clockfly/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore this PR, the output of EXPLAIN of following SQL is like\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE extTable_with_partitions (key INT, value

this PR, the output is like\n\n```\nExecutedCommand\n:  +- CreateTableCommand CatalogTable(\n    Table:`extTable_with_partitions`\n    Created:Thu Jun 02 21:30:54 PDT 2016\n    Last Access:Wed Dec 31

However, this does not have special handling for Data Source Tables. If needed, we need to move the logics of `DDLUtil`. Let me know if we should do it in this PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds code generation to `Generate`. It supports two code paths:\r\n- General `TraversableOnce` based iteration. This used for regular `Generator` (code generation supporting) expressions. This code path expects the expression to return a `TraversableOnce[InternalRow]` and it will iterate over the returned collection. This PR adds code generation for the `stack` generator.\r\n- Specialized `ArrayData/MapData` based iteration. This is used for the `explode`, `posexplode` & `inline` functions and operates directly on the `ArrayData`/`MapData` result that the child of the generator returns.\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\nI have

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira link : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15275\n\nFor bucketed tables in Hive, one can also add constraint about column sortedness along with ordering.\nAs per the spec in [0], CREATE TABLE statement can allow SORT ordering as well:\n\n  [CLUSTERED BY (col_name, col_name, ...) [SORTED BY (col_name [ASC|DESC], ...)] INTO num_buckets BUCKETS]\n\n[0] : https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-CreateTable\n\nCurrently CatalogTable does not store any information about the sort ordering and just has the names of the sorted columns. This PR adds `CatalogSortOrder` to hold the sorted column name and the sorted order. Currently this information is _not_ used in query execution but can be used as more support for bucketing is added. Possible advantage is ability to skip rows while performing predicate matching.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCurrently trunk does support creating bucketed hive tables. I am relying on existing tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n(This is the branch-1.6 version of #13039)\n\nWhen we acquire execution memory, we do a lot of things between shrinking the storage memory pool and enlarging the execution memory pool. In particular, we call memoryStore.evictBlocksToFreeSpace, which may do a lot of I/O and can throw exceptions. If an exception is thrown, the pool sizes on that executor will be in a bad state.\n\nThis patch minimizes the things we do between the two calls to make the resizing more atomic.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-05-11T21:03:44Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T00:36:02Z","closed_at":"2016-05-12T00:36:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04e10a7c57a1eddf749fa1d36e692d0905eb16c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df1b9976f8cefdbfa6e530da218c47a8d59cca97","head":{"label":"andrewor14:safer-pool-1.6","ref":"safer-pool-1.6","sha":"df1b9976f8cefdbfa6e530da218c47a8d59cca97","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf an executor is still alive even after the scheduler has removed its metadata, we may receive a heartbeat from that executor and tell its block manager to reregister itself. If that happens, the block manager master will know about the executor, but the scheduler will not.\n\nThat is a dangerous situation, because when the executor does get disconnected later, the scheduler will not ask the block manager to also remove metadata for that executor. Later, when we try to clean up an RDD or a broadcast variable, we may try to send a message to that executor, triggering an exception.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-05-11T18:27:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T20:47:59Z","closed_at":"2016-05-11T20:38:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13c7bd5fd913f27e7636b2ab045371a26c4e3b1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13055/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13055/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13055/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c03767f2c122dbc588ae3e0fbad30f01b44a8a19","head":{"label":"andrewor14:block-manager-remove","ref":"block-manager-remove","sha":"c03767f2c122dbc588ae3e0fbad30f01b44a8a19","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen running with Kinesis Consumer Library (KCL), against a stream that contains aggregated data, the KCL needs access to protobuf to de-aggregate the records.   Without this patch, that results in the following error message:\n\n```\n   Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.google.protobuf.ProtocolStringList\n```\n\nThis PR upgrades the protobuf dependency within the kinesis-asl-assembly, and relocates that package (as not to conflict with Spark's use of 2.5.0), which fixes the above CNFE.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUsed kinesis word count example against a stream containing aggregated data.\n\nSee: SPARK-14421\n","created_at":"2016-05-11T17:54:45Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T19:37:13Z","closed_at":"2016-05-12T19:12:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0ee3a61d1ee1624d88d1e6d79837350f7b52042","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13054/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13054/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13054/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a532c3e1f4afa496e2181ebdc5568914d463ae5","head":{"label":"boneill42:protobuf-relocation-for-kcl","ref":"protobuf-relocation-for-kcl","sha":"0a532c3e1f4afa496e2181ebdc5568914d463ae5","user":{"login":"boneill42","id":897229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzIyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/897229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42","html_url":"https://github.com/boneill42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":55791898,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTc5MTg5OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"boneill42/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"boneill42","id":897229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzIyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/897229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42","html_url":"https://github.com/boneill42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneill42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/boneill42/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nMesos agents by default will not pull docker images which are cached\nlocally already. In order to run Spark executors from mutable tags like\n`:latest` this commit introduces a Spark setting\n`spark.mesos.executor.docker.forcePullImage`. Setting this flag to\ntrue will tell the Mesos agent to force pull the docker image (default is `false` which is consistent with the previous\nimplementation and Mesos' default\nbehaviour).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI ran a sample application including this change on a Mesos cluster and verified the correct behaviour for both, with and without, force pulling the executor image. As expected the image is being force pulled if the flag is set.\n","created_at":"2016-05-11T14:39:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T20:19:13Z","closed_at":"2016-07-25T19:17:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d05649b0dc3321273431d93afba447fa45b6598","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/36b32584bcd8197ecb8e6b8d92954270c735a62f","head":{"label":"philipphoffmann:force-pull-image","ref":"force-pull-image","sha":"36b32584bcd8197ecb8e6b8d92954270c735a62f","user":{"login":"philipphoffmann","id":1279634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann","html_url":"https://github.com/philipphoffmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26526148,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjUyNjE0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"philipphoffmann/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"philipphoffmann","id":1279634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann","html_url":"https://github.com/philipphoffmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipphoffmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/philipphoffmann/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, Parquet, JSON and CSV data sources have a class for thier options, (`ParquetOptions`, `JSONOptions` and `CSVOptions`).\n\nIt is convenient to manage options for sources to gather options into a class. Currently, `JDBC`, `Text`, `libsvm` and `ORC` datasources do not have this class. This might be nicer if these options are in a unified format so that options can be added and \n\nThis PR refactors the options in Spark internal data sources adding new classes, `OrcOptions`, `TextOptions`, `JDBCOptions` and `LibSVMOptions`.\n\nAlso, this PR change the default compression codec for ORC from `NONE` to `SNAPPY`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this for refactoring and unittests in `OrcHadoopFsRelationSuite` for changing the default compression codec for ORC.\n","created_at":"2016-05-11T10:26:57Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:20Z","closed_at":"2016-05-13T16:06:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d16a46923c00da85ad46f347448d0fde3e72dc38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13048/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13048/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13048/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f538d75071245cb2e9b1fd9797a174ce894576a1","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-15267","ref":"SPARK-15267","sha":"f538d75071245cb2e9b1fd9797a174ce894576a1","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Proposed Change\n\nAfter picking each new initial centers, it's unnecessary to compute the distances between all the points and the old ones. \nInstead this change keep the distance between all the points and their closest centers, and compare to the distance of them with the new center then update them.\n## Test result\n\nI test the KMeans++ method for a small dataset with 16k points, and the whole KMeans|| with a large one with 240k points.\nThe data has 4096 features and I tunes K from 100 to 500.\nThe test environment was on my 4 machine cluster, I also tested a 3M points data on a larger cluster with 25 machines and got similar results, which I would not draw the detail curve.

As if the data is normalized into (0,1), one improvement in the original vesion for util.MLUtils.fastSauaredDistance would have no effect (the precisionBound 2.0 \\* EPSILON \\* sumSquaredNorm / (normDiff \\* normDiff + EPSILON) will never less then precision in this case). Therefore I design an early terminal method when comparing two distance (used for findClosest).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15263\n\nThe current logic for directory cleanup is slow because it does directory listing, recurses over child directories, checks for symbolic links, deletes leaf files and finally deletes the dirs when they are empty. There is back-and-forth switching from kernel space to user space while doing this. Since most of the deployment backends would be Unix systems, we could essentially just do `rm -rf` so that entire deletion logic runs in kernel space.\n\nThe current Java based impl in Spark seems to be similar to what standard libraries like guava and commons IO do (eg. http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/io/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.java?view=markup#l1540). However, guava removed this method in favour of shelling out to an operating system command (like in this PR). See the `Deprecated` note in older javadocs for guava for details : http://google.github.io/guava/releases/10.0.1/api/docs/com/google/common/io/Files.html#deleteRecursively(java.io.File)\n\nIdeally, Java should be providing such APIs so that users won't have to do such things to get platform specific code. Also, its not just about speed, but also handling race conditions while doing at FS deletions is tricky. I could find this bug for Java in similar context : http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7148952\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI am relying on existing test cases to test the method. If there are suggestions about testing it, welcome to hear about it.\n## Performance gains\n\n_Input setup_ : Created a nested directory structure of depth 3 and each entry having 50 sub-dirs.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen a CSV begins with:\n- `,,`\n  OR\n- `\"\",\"\",`\n\nmeaning that the first column names are either empty or blank strings and `header` is specified to be `true`, then the column name is replaced with `C` + the index number of that given column. For example, if you were to read in the CSV:\n\n```\n\"\",\"second column\"\n\"hello\", \"there\"\n```\n\nThen column names would become `\"C0\", \"second column\"`. \n\nThis behavior aligns with what currently happens when `header` is specified to be `false` in recent versions of Spark.\n### Current Behavior in Spark <=1.6\n\nIn Spark <=1.6, a CSV with a blank column name becomes a blank string, `\"\"`, meaning that this column cannot be accessed. However the CSV reads in without issue.\n### Current Behavior in Spark 2.0\n\nSpark throws a NullPointerError and will not read in the file.\n#### Reproduction in 2.0\n\nhttps://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/346304/2828750690305044/484361/latest.html\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA new test was added to `CSVSuite` to account for this issue. We then have asserts that test for being able to select both the empty column names as well as the regular column

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we acquire execution memory, we do a lot of things between shrinking the storage memory pool and enlarging the execution memory pool. In particular, we call `memoryStore.evictBlocksToFreeSpace`, which may do a lot of I/O and can throw exceptions. If an exception is thrown, the pool sizes on that executor will be in a bad state.\n\nThis patch minimizes the things we do between the two calls to make the resizing more atomic.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-05-10T23:57:38Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T21:04:35Z","closed_at":"2016-05-11T20:00:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"878a4f398601e0ccd7b69bb3adbcdcb43646b6a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13039/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13039/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13039/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df67bda26475d61f8caa66da0cdb90fd48b2c6a8","head":{"label":"andrewor14:safer-pool","ref":"safer-pool","sha":"df67bda26475d61f8caa66da0cdb90fd48b2c6a8","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSometimes the \"Aggregated Metrics by Executor\" table on the Stage page can get very long so actor links to the Accumulators and Tasks tables below it have been added to the summary at the top of the page. This has been done in the same way as the Jobs and Stages pages. Note: the Accumulators link only displays when the table exists.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually Tested and dev/run-tests\n\n![justtasks](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13952758/15165269/6e8efe8c-16c9-11e6-9784-cffe966fdcf0.png)\n![withaccumulators](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13952758/15165270/7019ec9e-16c9-11e6-8649-db69ed7a317d.png)\n","created_at":"2016-05-10T23:09:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T08:34:51Z","closed_at":"2016-06-25T08:29:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e856431edf30768bc91851aaa9c2efafee745c57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e62eb3344e41814b12a783ec51bec871dc8320b","head":{"label":"ajbozarth:spark1301","ref":"spark1301","sha":"9e62eb3344e41814b12a783ec51bec871dc8320b","user":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41503793,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTUwMzc5Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ajbozarth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAfter SPARK-14669 it seems the sort time metric includes both spill and record insertion time. This makes it not very useful since the metric becomes close to the total execution time of the node.\n\nWe should track just the time spent for in-memory sort, as before.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nVerified metric in the UI, also unit test on UnsafeExternalRowSorter.\n\ncc @davies

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently the `AccumulatorV2` is kind of messy as it mixes the logic of how to accumulate inputs and how to control the metadata. This PR adds an `AccumulatorWrapper` to take care of the metadata management and make our accumulator framework more flexible.\n\nOne drawback is, this makes the API a little harder to use. e.g. now users have to use `wrapper.accumulator.add` in RDD closure instead of `acc1.add`.\n\nThis PR is a prototype.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting
