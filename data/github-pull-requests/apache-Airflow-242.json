happening while a separate connection is allocated for each of them. It results in DB failures.\r\n\r\nHaving SingletonThreadPool allows us to reuse the same connection. Also SingletonThreadPool is useful for other places (WebServer, Scheduler) because they are single-threaded.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6983](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6983)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

SageMakerTrainingOperator is currently not idempotent. AWS requires training jobs to have unique names, and training jobs cannot be deleted/updated. Rerunning a SageMakerTrainingOperator will currently raise an exception because it cannot create a training job with the same name.\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest to add an argument `action_if_job_exists`, which determines the behaviour in case the training job name already exists. Possible options are `increment` (default) and `fail`, where increment lists all training jobs prefixed with the given name and suffixes the name with length+1:\r\n\r\nRerunning will result in training job names:\r\nmytrainingjob\r\nmytrainingjob-2\r\nmytrainingjob-3\r\n....\r\n\r\n(the training job name is returned - and thus in an XCom, so users can fetch the updated training job name in a successive task)\r\n\r\nThe `fail` mode will simply fail if a training job with the same name is encountered.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR implements a generic method `_list_request` on the SageMakerHook, for performing list operations on boto3. All boto3 `list_*` methods follow the same structure and `_list_request` provides an easy interface to iteratively fetch all results (since AWS returns results in batches).\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6884](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6884)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

introduced a bug due to which Paused Dags where still Scheduled.\r\n\r\nThe Bug is the following query returns a list of sets:\r\n\r\nQuery:\r\n```python\r\npaused_dag_ids = (\r\n            session.query(DagModel.dag_id)\r\n            .filter(DagModel.is_paused.is_(True))\r\n            .filter(DagModel.dag_id.in_(dagbag.dag_ids))\r\n            .all()\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n```python\r\n[('example_bash_operator',)]\r\n```\r\nHence in `_find_dags_to_process()` (below):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if len(self.dag_ids) > 0:\r\n            dags = [dag for dag in dags\r\n                    if dag.dag_id in self.dag_ids and\r\n                    dag.dag_id not in paused_dag_ids]\r\n        else:\r\n            dags = [dag for dag in dags\r\n                    if dag.dag_id not in paused_dag_ids]\r\n        return dags\r\n``` \r\n\r\nfollowing happens:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndags = [dag for dag in dags if \"example_bash_operator\" not in [('example_bash_operator',)] ] \r\n```\r\nThis evaluates to false. Instead `paused_dag_ids` should be `{'example_bash_operator'}` (A set) or just a list `['example_bash_operator']`\r\n\r\nSimplified Problem and solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: a = [('example_bash_operator',)]\r\n\r\nIn [2]: b = 'example_bash_operator'\r\n\r\nIn [3]: set(aa for aa in a)\r\nOut[3]: {('example_bash_operator',)}\r\n\r\nIn [4]: b in a\r\nOut[4]: False\r\n\r\nIn [5]: set(aa for aa, in a)\r\nOut[5]: {'example_bash_operator'}\r\n\r\nIn [6]: b in set(aa for aa, in a)\r\nOut[6]: True\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6856](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6856)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

script will run the SchedulerJob for the specified dags \"to completion\".\n\nThat is it creates a fixed number of DAG runs for the specified DAGs (from\nthe configured dag path/example dags etc), disable the scheduler from\ncreating more, and then monitor them for completion. When the file task of\nthe final dag run is completed the scheduler will be terminated.\n\nThe aim of this script is to have a benchmark for real-world scheduler\nperformance -- i.e. total time take to run N dag runs to completion.\n\nIt is recommended to repeat the test at least 3 times so that you can get\nsomewhat-accurate variance on the reported timing numbers.\n\n---\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6454](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6454)\n\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\n\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.
