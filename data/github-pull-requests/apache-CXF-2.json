Maintainers,\r\n\r\nOur [Nondex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool has detected a potential flaky test at `org.apache.cxf.tools.wadlto.jaxrs.JAXRSContainerTest.testThrows`. This flakiness is caused by an ordering issue when iterating over a HashMap and using assertArrayEquals in the unit test.\r\n\r\nThe issue with map.entrySet() lies in the fact that HashMap does not guarantee any specific iteration order for its entries. This lack of deterministic ordering introduces an element of randomness to the test execution, causing unreliable test results. Here are some reasons why this can happen:\r\n\r\nNon-Deterministic Ordering in HashMap: HashMap inherently has no fixed order for its elements, and this order can change across different runs or Java versions. As a result, iterating over map.entrySet() may yield entries in a different sequence each time, depending on factors like hash code distribution and hash collisions.\r\n\r\nUse of assertArrayEquals: The assertArrayEquals method in JUnit (and similar testing frameworks) checks for exact order in array elements. When the test iterates over a HashMap and collects entries into an array for comparison, any change in iteration order will cause assertArrayEquals to fail, even if the contents of the array are logically the same.\r\n\r\nImpact on Test Consistency: This ordering inconsistency means that the test can pass or fail unpredictably, depending on the iteration order of the HashMap. Such flaky behavior can cause false negatives, where a test fails not because of a bug in the code under test, but due to the non-deterministic nature of HashMap ordering.\r\n\r\nConcurrency and Threading Issues: If there are multiple threads accessing or modifying the HashMap during the test (intentionally or unintentionally), this can further exacerbate flakiness. Any modification to the map’s state while iterating can lead to ConcurrentModificationException or silent changes in iteration order.\r\n\r\nThus, we have suggested:\r\n1. HashMap to LinkedHashMap\r\n2. assertArrayEquals to assertEquals with Set collections","created_at":"2024-11-12T04:35:41Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T00:02:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3aa0ff3bb216a5ed9015fb5fd75fb602a0e71eee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/2147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/2147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/2147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/statuses/d75afa53acfe95c141765dfbb59637f5f02febda","head":{"label":"Derrick2000:flaky","ref":"flaky","sha":"d75afa53acfe95c141765dfbb59637f5f02febda","user":{"login":"Derrick2000","id":60729943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzI5OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60729943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000","html_url":"https://github.com/Derrick2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":886986490,"node_id":"R_kgDONN5W-g","name":"cxf","full_name":"Derrick2000/cxf","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Derrick2000","id":60729943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzI5OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60729943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000","html_url":"https://github.com/Derrick2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derrick2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Derrick2000/cxf","description":"Apache

These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2549\">#2549</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.13 - 14 Oct 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.12 - 07 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>\n<p>This change is currently unavailable for GitHub Enterprise Server customers, as <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> and <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> are not yet compatible with GHES.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2519\">#2519</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.10 - 30 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/zstd/\">Zstandard</a>.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.12 - 07 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>\n<p>This change is currently unavailable for GitHub Enterprise Server customers, as <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> and <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> are not yet compatible with GHES.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2519\">#2519</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.10 - 30 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/zstd/\">Zstandard</a>.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520\">#2520</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>\n<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/\">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows.

joining the Git community and updating &quot;master&quot; to &quot;main&quot;. Using the term &quot;master&quot; for the main\ndevelopment branch can be offensive to some people. Existing versions of Git have been always capable of\nworking with any branch name and since 2.28.0 (July 2020) the default initial branch is configurable\n(<code>init.defaultBranch</code>). Since October 2020, the default branch for new repositories on GitHub\nis &quot;main&quot;. Finally, PMD will also use this new name for the main branch in all our own repositories.</p>\n<p>Why &quot;main&quot;? PMD uses a very simple branching model - pull requests with feature branches and one main development\nbranch, from which releases are created. That's why &quot;main&quot; is currently the best fitting name.</p>\n<p>More information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/\">https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories-is-now-main/\">https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories-is-now-main/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What changes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We change the default branch on GitHub, so that pull requests are automatically created against <code>main</code> from\nnow on.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have already a local clone of PMD's repository, you'll need to rename the old master branch locally:</p>\n<pre><code>git branch --move master main\ngit fetch origin\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\ngit remote set-head origin --auto\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info:\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branch-Management#_changing_master\">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branch-Management#_changing_master</a> and\n<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch#updating-a-local-clone-after-a-branch-name-changes\">https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch#updating-a-local-clone-after-a-branch-name-changes</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you created a fork on GitHub, you'll need to change the default branch in your fork to <code>main</code> as</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/zstd/\">Zstandard</a>.

joining the Git community and updating &quot;master&quot; to &quot;main&quot;. Using the term &quot;master&quot; for the main\ndevelopment branch can be offensive to some people. Existing versions of Git have been always capable of\nworking with any branch name and since 2.28.0 (July 2020) the default initial branch is configurable\n(<code>init.defaultBranch</code>). Since October 2020, the default branch for new repositories on GitHub\nis &quot;main&quot;. Finally, PMD will also use this new name for the main branch in all our own repositories.</p>\n<p>Why &quot;main&quot;? PMD uses a very simple branching model - pull requests with feature branches and one main development\nbranch, from which releases are created. That's why &quot;main&quot; is currently the best fitting name.</p>\n<p>More information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/\">https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories-is-now-main/\">https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories-is-now-main/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What changes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We change the default branch on GitHub, so that pull requests are automatically created against <code>main</code> from\nnow on.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have already a local clone of PMD's repository, you'll need to rename the old master branch locally:</p>\n<pre><code>git branch --move master main\ngit fetch origin\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\ngit remote set-head origin --auto\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info:\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branch-Management#_changing_master\">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branch-Management#_changing_master</a> and\n<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch#updating-a-local-clone-after-a-branch-name-changes\">https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch#updating-a-local-clone-after-a-branch-name-changes</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you created a fork on GitHub, you'll need to change the default branch in your fork to <code>main</code> as</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.8 - 19 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2483\">#2483</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.7 - 13 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2471\">#2471</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.6 - 29 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2449\">#2449</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.7 - 13 Sep 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2471\">#2471</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.6 - 29 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2449\">#2449</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning.
