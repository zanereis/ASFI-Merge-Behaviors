Calls to HDFS will get tagged in the audit log as originating from the History Server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOther Spark processes set the `CallerContext`, so that additional auditing context propagates in Hadoop RPC calls. This PR provides auditing context for calls from the History Server. Other callers provide additional information like app ID, attempt ID, etc. We don't provide that here through History Server, which serves multiple apps/attempts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. In environments that configure `hadoop.caller.context.enabled=true`, users will now see additional information in the HDFS audit logs explicitly stating that calls originated from the History Server.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test has been added. All tests pass in the history package.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn -pl core test -Dtest=none -DmembersOnlySuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.history\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the changes are deployed to a running cluster, the new caller context is visible in the HDFS audit logs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2025-02-07 23:00:54,657 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSNamesystem.audit: allowed=true\tugi=spark

Starting from version 1.6.0, `Java XML Binding` has been upgraded to `Jakarta XML Binding`,  the related commit is: https://github.com/jpmml/jpmml-model/commit/d76de1c814bc8b85c2a7829ff690ed5c19a404c7\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the exported PMML model schema version has been upgraded from 4.3(https://dmg.org/pmml/v4-3/GeneralStructure.html) to 4.4(https://dmg.org/pmml/v4-4-1/GeneralStructure.html).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Upgrade the PMML standard to the latest 4.4 version ;\r\n2. Upgrade `Java XML Binding` to `Jakarta XML Binding` by upgrade `JPMML`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the exported PMML model version has been upgraded from 4.3 to 4.4, details are as follows:\r\n1. `version` has been changed from 4.2 to 4.4;\r\n2. `xmlns` has been changed from `http://www.dmg.org/PMML-4_3` to `http://www.dmg.org/PMML-4_4`;\r\n3. `Application version` has been changed to the  current Spark version.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n<PMML version=\"4.2\" xmlns=\"http://www.dmg.org/PMML-4_3\" xmlns:data=\"http://jpmml.org/jpmml-model/InlineTable\">\r\n    <Header description=\"k-means clustering\">\r\n        <Application name=\"Apache Spark MLlib\" version=\"3.5.4\"/>\r\n        <Timestamp>2025-02-08T10:00:55</Timestamp>\r\n    </Header>\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\r\n<PMML version=\"4.4\" xmlns=\"http://www.dmg.org/PMML-4_4\" xmlns:data=\"http://jpmml.org/jpmml-model/InlineTable\">\r\n    <Header description=\"k-means clustering\">\r\n        <Application name=\"Apache Spark MLlib\" version=\"4.1.0-SNAPSHOT\"/>\r\n        <Timestamp>2025-02-08T11:34:40</Timestamp>\r\n    </Header>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Despite this change, on the one hand, PMML version 4.4 was released as early as November 2019.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change in this PR is the addition of two `assume` conditions to ensure that the test cases related to 'connect' in the YarnClusterSuite are only executed on Github Actions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRun these two test cases successfully locally is overly complicated.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is necessary to install the required Python packages:  \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f5f7c365d519c4f9d4b7a5dce2c8a047cf051899/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L363\r\n\r\nOtherwise, local test execution will fail due to missing Python modules.\r\n\r\nSecondly, before running tests locally, a packaging operation must be performed to ensure that all dependencies are collected in the `assembly/target/scala-2.13/jars` directory. For example, executing `build/sbt package -Pyarn`. Failing to do so will result in the following error during local test execution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/resource-managers/yarn/target/test/data/org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite/yarn-264663/org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite-localDir-nm-0_0/usercache/yangjie01/appcache/application_1738914482522_0019/container_1738914482522_0019_01_000001/test.py\", line 13, in <module>\r\n    \"spark.api.mode\", \"connect\").master(\"yarn\").getOrCreate()\r\n                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/python/pyspark/sql/session.py\", line 511, in getOrCreate\r\n    RemoteSparkSession._start_connect_server(url, opts)\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/python/pyspark/sql/connect/session.py\", line 1073, in _start_connect_server\r\n    PySparkSession(SparkContext.getOrCreate(conf))\r\n                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/python/pyspark/core/context.py\", line 523, in getOrCreate\r\n    SparkContext(conf=conf or SparkConf())\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/python/pyspark/core/context.py\", line 207, in __init__\r\n    self._do_init(\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/python/pyspark/core/context.py\", line 300, in _do_init\r\n    self._jsc = jsc or self._initialize_context(self._conf._jconf)\r\n                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/python/pyspark/core/context.py\", line 429, in _initialize_context\r\n    return self._jvm.JavaSparkContext(jconf)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9.9-src.zip/py4j/java_gateway.py\", line 1627, in __call__\r\n  File \"/Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9.9-src.zip/py4j/protocol.py\", line 327, in get_return_value\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling None.org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaSparkContext.\r\n: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.spark.sql.connect.SparkConnectPlugin\r\n        at java.base/java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:445)\r\n        at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:592)\r\n        at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:525)\r\n        at java.base/java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)\r\n        at java.base/java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:467)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.util.SparkClassUtils.classForName(SparkClassUtils.scala:41)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.util.SparkClassUtils.classForName$(SparkClassUtils.scala:36)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.classForName(Utils.scala:99)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.$anonfun$loadExtensions$1(Utils.scala:2828)\r\n        at scala.collection.StrictOptimizedIterableOps.flatMap(StrictOptimizedIterableOps.scala:118)\r\n        at scala.collection.StrictOptimizedIterableOps.flatMap$(StrictOptimizedIterableOps.scala:105)\r\n        at scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq.flatMap(ArraySeq.scala:35)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.loadExtensions(Utils.scala:2826)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.internal.plugin.PluginContainer$.apply(PluginContainer.scala:210)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.internal.plugin.PluginContainer$.apply(PluginContainer.scala:196)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.SparkContext.<init>(SparkContext.scala:588)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaSparkContext.<init>(JavaSparkContext.scala:59)\r\n        at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\r\n        at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:77)\r\n        at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)\r\n        at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstanceWithCaller(Constructor.java:500)\r\n        at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:481)\r\n        at py4j.reflection.MethodInvoker.invoke(MethodInvoker.java:247)\r\n        at py4j.reflection.ReflectionEngine.invoke(ReflectionEngine.java:374)\r\n        at py4j.Gateway.invoke(Gateway.java:238)\r\n        at py4j.commands.ConstructorCommand.invokeConstructor(ConstructorCommand.java:80)\r\n        at py4j.commands.ConstructorCommand.execute(ConstructorCommand.java:69)\r\n        at py4j.ClientServerConnection.waitForCommands(ClientServerConnection.java:184)\r\n        at py4j.ClientServerConnection.run(ClientServerConnection.java:108)\r\n        at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:840)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, when running tests locally, the `clean` command should not be added. For instance, executing the following command\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"yarn/testOnly org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite\" -Pyarn\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill result in successful tests. However, if the `clean` command is included, as in\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean \"yarn/testOnly org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite\" -Pyarn\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe same test failure will occur.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, adding `assume` conditions for testing is also relatively complex:\r\n\r\n1. It is necessary to check that at least five essential Python modules are installed: pandas, pyarrow, grpc, grpcio, googleapis_common_protos.\r\n2. It must be confirmed that the contents in `assembly/target/scala-2.13/jars` are fresh and usable.\r\n\r\nGiven these circumstances, the current pr proposes that test cases related to `connect` in the `YarnClusterSuite` should only be executed in the GitHub pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/actions/runs/13196611264/job/36839274825\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6159b7b5-ab67-4698-a26c-9b4adfd10665)\r\n\r\n\r\n- locally check:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean \"yarn/testOnly org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite\" -Pyarn\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe can see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] YarnClusterSuite:\r\n...\r\n[info] - run Python application with Spark Connect in yarn-client mode !!!

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSelf host docsearch.min.css.map in Spark website\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the console of Spark website, I saw error messages after using the search box:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nERROR /docs/latest/css/docsearch.min.css.map' not found\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough the website is still functioning, it's nice to self-host the `.map` file as well. It can help debugging and reduce error logs. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nLocal build and preview\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKills the Python worker on idle timeout introduced at #49818.\r\n\r\n- Spark conf: `spark.python.worker.killOnIdleTimeout` (default `false`)\r\n    Whether Spark should terminate the Python worker process when the idle timeout (as defined by spark.python.worker.idleTimeoutSeconds) is reached. If enabled, Spark will terminate the Python worker process in addition to logging the status.\r\n- SQL conf: `spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.killOnIdleTimeout`\r\n    The same as `spark.python.worker.killOnIdleTimeout`, but this is a runtime conf for Python UDFs. Falls back to `spark.python.worker.killOnIdleTimeout`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen the Python worker gets stuck, currently there is no way to resume the execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nWhen `spark.python.worker.idleTimeoutSeconds` is set to a positive number, and set `spark.python.worker.killOnIdleTimeout` to `true`, once it detects a Python worker as stuck, the executor will try to kill the process, which will cause a task failure but Spark will retry the task.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimplify the resolution of EXISTS_DEFAULT on ResolveDefaultColumns::getExistenceDefaultValues(), which are called from file readers on executors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark executors unnecessary contacts catalogs when resolving EXISTS_DEFAULTS (used for default values for existing data) for a column.\r\n\r\nDetailed explanation: The code path for default values first runs an analysis of the user-provided CURRENT_DEFAULT value for a column (to evaluate functions, etc), and uses the result sql to save as the column's EXISTS_DEFAULT. EXISTS_DEFAULT is then used to avoid having to rewrite existing data using backfill to fill this value in the files.  When reading existing files, Spark then attempts to resolve the EXISTS_DEFAULT metadata and use the value for null values it finds in that column. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, this second step on read redundantly runs all the analyzer rules again and finish analysis rules on EXISTS_DEFAULTS, some of which contact the catalog unnecessarily.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix correctness with UNION/EXCEPT/INTERSECT inside a view or `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples the SQL Parser considers UNION/EXCEPT/INTERSECT keywords as aliases and drops the rest of the query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v1 AS SELECT 1 AS col1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM v1\").show()\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM v1\").queryExecution.analyzed\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v1 AS SELECT 1 AS col1 EXCEPT SELECT 2 EXCEPT SELECT 1 EXCEPT SELECT 2\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM v1\").show()\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM v1\").queryExecution.analyzed\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW t1 AS SELECT 1 AS col1 INTERSECT SELECT 1 INTERSECT SELECT 2 INTERSECT SELECT 2\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM v1\").show()\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM v1\").queryExecution.analyzed\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"DECLARE v INT\")\r\nspark.sql(\"EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3' INTO v\")\r\nspark.sql(\"EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3' INTO v\").queryExecution.analyzed\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT v\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef726178-2375-4ebc-a7e3-88f1991d1016)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b4b7ba-bc7d-4fc1-a921-f4cbfcab79a3)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b65325-5dd9-4d74-b46d-8ea203ce1039)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c53c5e02-18c6-4e30-b834-94af619190c5)\r\n\r\nThere's no correctness issue associated with regular queries (without the `VIEW` or `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`). Apparently that's because we use `ParserInterface.parsePlan` (`singleStatement` term in Spark SQL grammar) for [regular queries](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b968ce1d3ac1b72019b30bf3d4e11d9574ba1205/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/classic/SparkSession.scala#L490) and `ParserInterface.parseQuery` (`query` term in Spark SQL grammar) for [view bodies](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b968ce1d3ac1b72019b30bf3d4e11d9574ba1205/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/catalog/SessionCatalog.scala#L986) and [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE with INTO](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b968ce1d3ac1b72019b30bf3d4e11d9574ba1205/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/executeImmediate.scala#L167). The difference is that `singleStatement` [ends in EOF](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b968ce1d3ac1b72019b30bf3d4e11d9574ba1205/sql/api/src/main/antlr4/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/parser/SqlBaseParser.g4#L144).\r\n\r\nNot sure what's the actual root cause, because I don't know much about the SQL Parser.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCorrectness issue fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the results of queries on top of aforementioned views are gonna be correct.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew `view-correctness` suite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the `pyarrow` table is empty, avoid calling the `to_pandas` method due to potential segfault failures. Instead, an empty pandas dataframe is created manually.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StructField, ArrayType, StringType, StructType, IntegerType\r\nimport faulthandler\r\nfaulthandler.enable()\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\r\n    .remote(\"sc://localhost:15002\") \\\r\n    .getOrCreate()\r\nsp_df = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    data = [],\r\n    schema=StructType(\r\n        [\r\n            StructField(\r\n                name='b_int',\r\n                dataType=IntegerType(),\r\n                nullable=False,\r\n            ),\r\n            StructField(\r\n                name='b',\r\n                dataType=ArrayType(ArrayType(StringType(), True), True),\r\n                nullable=True,\r\n            ),\r\n        ]\r\n    )\r\n)\r\nprint(sp_df)\r\nprint('Spark dataframe generated.')\r\nprint(sp_df.toPandas())\r\nprint('Pandas dataframe generated.') \r\n```\r\nExecuting this may lead to a segfault when the line `sp_df.toPandas()` is run.\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nThread 0x00000001f1904f40 (most recent call first):\r\n  File \"/Users/venkata.gudesa/spark/test_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pyarrow/pandas_compat.py\", line 808 in table_to_dataframe\r\n  File \"/Users/venkata.gudesa/spark/test_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 949 in to_pandas\r\n  File \"/Users/venkata.gudesa/spark/test_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pyspark/sql/connect/dataframe.py\", line 1857 in toPandas\r\n  File \"<python-input-3>\", line 1 in <module>\r\n  File \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.13/3.13.0_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/code.py\", line 92 in runcode\r\n  File \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.13/3.13.0_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/_pyrepl/console.py\", line 205 in runsource\r\n  File \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.13/3.13.0_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/code.py\", line 313 in push\r\n  File \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.13/3.13.0_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/_pyrepl/simple_interact.py\", line 160 in run_multiline_interactive_console\r\n  File \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.13/3.13.0_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/_pyrepl/main.py\", line 59 in interactive_console\r\n  File \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.13/3.13.0_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/_pyrepl/__main__.py\", line 6 in <module>\r\n  File \"<frozen runpy>\", line 88 in _run_code\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes.

Therefore, the FillStaticPartitions optimization rule is added to fill the static partitions of the InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen executing the following SQL ：\r\ninsert overwrite table A partition(event_day, event_type) select id, event_day, event_type from B where event_day = '20240712'\r\n\r\nBefore this pr staticPartitions would be empty in InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b920a8-ada2-4cb3-98c0-7492a2b2839f)\r\n\r\nAfter this pr staticPartitions would be specific partition values\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ad2be78-7b55-4c14-b32f-a6464173c5d3)\r\n\r\nThe benefit is that when executing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa7b0d07-8937-401e-883d-bbf3a735ac70)\r\nin InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand, it can greatly reduce the pressure on hive and improve the efficiency of task execution.\r\nFor example, when a table named A with millions of partitions executes the following sql：\r\n```hiveql\r\ninsert overwrite table A partition(event_day, event_type) select id, event_day, event_type from B where event_day = '20240712' \r\n``` \r\nIt will appear in hive that all partitions of table A are fetched at once, which is very likely to cause slow queries in hive metastore and even drag down the overall performance of Hive's metadata queries. At the same time, the job execution is very slow.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, only the specified partition and its sub-partitions are fetched, which takes milliseconds to seconds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nScala `ParVector` is used to initialize the streams, and this variable creates a thread pool with a number of threads equal to `Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors`.  When the number of streams exceeds the number of threads in the pool, it needs to wait for the previous stream to complete before initializing the next one, leading to sequential waiting.\r\n\r\nIf the consumers of different topic InputStreams are configured with the same group id, the Kafka server will trigger a rebalance operation due to the new consumers joining the group. This rebalance operation can be time-consuming, and when there are many streams, it can cause the initialization process to hang very long time.\r\n\r\nWe'd better to create a thread pool with a specified number of threads for initialization. This can help the Driver complete the process faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen multiple Kafka `InputDStream` are used (number exceeding the  Driver's physical machine `Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors`), and the consumers are configured with the same group id. Driver will remains stuck and log 'Request joining group due to: group is already rebalancing'.\r\n\r\nIt is more likely to occur in the k8s environment, because the cores of the Driver is exactly the same as the cores of the physical machine (`Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors`) .\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen writing dynamic partitions, some dynamic partitions in InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand can be compensated to specific partition values. Therefore, the FillStaticPartitions optimization rule is added to fill the static partitions of the InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a long-standing problem. With the GROUP BY ordinal feature, it's quite easy for users to write a complicated expression as the GROUP BY expression and also put it in the SELECT list. It's usually OK as the complicated expressions in the GROUP BY expression and SELECT list remain the same, but problems may occur with subquery expressions, duplicated relations, and CTE inline. Let's look at this example:\r\n```\r\nCREATE VIEW v AS\r\nWITH r AS (SELECT c1 + c2 AS c FROM t)\r\nSELECT * FROM r;\r\n\r\nSELECT (SELECT max(c) FROM v WHERE c > id) FROM range(1) GROUP BY 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nA scalar subquery appears in both the GROUP BY expression and SELECT list. The scalar subquery scans table `t`, and because this scalar subquery appears twice, `DeduplicateRelations` will trigger. This makes the output attributes of CTE def and ref out of sync in the second scalar subquery and `InlineCTE` will add a cosmetic `Project` to adjust the output attr ids. `CheckAnalysis` will inline CTE in the beginning, and this extra cosmetic `Project` in the second scalar subquery makes Spark think it's not semantically equal to the first scalar subquery and fails the query.\r\n\r\nThe proposal here is to remove cosmetic Projects during plan canonicalization.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, some queries fail before and work now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds logs when the Python worker looks stuck.\r\n\r\n- Spark conf: `spark.python.worker.idleTimeoutSeconds` (default `0` that means no timeout)\r\n    The time (in seconds) Spark will wait for activity (e.g., data transfer or communication) from a Python worker before considering it potentially idle or unresponsive. When the timeout is triggered, Spark will log the network-related status for debugging purposes.  However, the Python worker will remain active and continue waiting for communication. The default is `0` that means no timeout.\r\n- SQL conf: `spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.idleTimeoutSeconds`\r\n    The same as `spark.python.worker.idleTimeoutSeconds`, but this is a runtime conf for Python UDFs. Falls back to `spark.python.worker.idleTimeoutSeconds`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport time\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as sf\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.idleTimeoutSeconds', '1s')\r\n\r\n@sf.udf\r\ndef f(x):\r\n    time.sleep(2)\r\n    return str(x)\r\n\r\nspark.range(1).select(f(\"id\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill show a warning message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n... WARN PythonUDFWithNamedArgumentsRunner: Idle timeout reached for Python worker (timeout: 1 seconds). No data received from the worker process: handle.map(_.isAlive) = Some(true), channel.isConnected = true, channel.isBlocking = false, selector.isOpen = true, selectionKey.isValid = true, selectionKey.interestOps = 1, hasInputs = false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor the monitoring of the Python worker.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually checked the logs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd references from `DataFrame.exceptAll` to `DataFrame.subtract` and vice-versa.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's a small convenience for users reading the docs to easier see relevant and closely related methods.\r\n\r\nThis matches existing practice. For example, `DataFrame.union` and `DataFrame.unionAll` reference each other in this way already.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a doc change only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to test this as I am having trouble building the docs locally.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-51097\r\n\r\nThis PR sets up partition-specific metrics (`rocksdbSnapshotLastUploaded.partition_<version>_<state store name>` to be precise) in the executor side and publishes them through StreamingQueryProgress.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere's currently a lack of observability into partition-level maintenance information, notably metrics of the last snapshot version uploaded. This affects the ability to identify performance degradation issues behind maintenance tasks and more as described in SPARK-51097.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThere will be some new metrics displayed from StreamingQueryProgress:\r\n```\r\nStreaming query made progress: {\r\n  ...\r\n  \"stateOperators\" : [ {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"customMetrics\" : {\r\n      ...\r\n      \"rocksdbSnapshotLastUploaded.partition_0_default\" : 2,\r\n      \"rocksdbSnapshotLastUploaded.partition_12_default\" : 10,\r\n      \"rocksdbSnapshotLastUploaded.partition_8_default\" : 10,\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"sources\" : ...,\r\n  \"sink\" : ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNot all partition's metrics will be published to remove noise in query progress messages. The upper threshold is configured using `STATE_STORE_PARTITION_METRICS_REPORT_LIMIT`, and will by default report 20% of the total number of partitions in use, clamped between 1 and 10.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFour new tests are added in RocksDBStateStoreIntegrationSuite. \r\n\r\nThe first two tests execute a dedup streaming query and verifies metrics are properly filtered + updated through the StreamingQueryProgress logs, but with different StateStore providers that skip maintenance tasks for specific partitions.\r\n\r\nThe other two tests execute a join streaming query, which contains four state stores per partition instead of one. These two tests verifies metrics are properly collected and filtered as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2025-02-05T19:17:49Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T00:25:43Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d5950e3bff30f2b4e3b12842f0d62d8ccbb3176","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the caller context for calls from DRIVER to HDFS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHDFS audit logs include the ability to add a \"caller context\".  Spark already leverages this to set the yarn application id, job id, task id, etc. but only on executors.  The caller context is left empty on the spark driver.  With introductions of Iceberg we have seen multiple scenarios in which files in HDFS are accessed from the driver. But since the caller context is left empty our ability to forensically analyse any issues has diminished. This PR includes sets caller context from the driver as well. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, hdfs audit logs will now have caller context for calls from driver.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested manually.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdjust some test parameters to work on s390x\r\n\r\nCoalesceShufflePartitionsSuite: The default lz4 compression does not generate the same compressed stream on all architectures especially for different endianness. Increase the maxRange on big endian so the same number of partitions are generated as on little endian.\r\n\r\nAdaptiveQueryExecSuite: Change the ADVISORY_PARTITION_SIZE_IN_BYTES from 1000 to 900 so that the same number of partitions is generated on amd64 and s390x.\r\n\r\nClientE2ETestSuite: Change the recursion depth from 500 to 400 for s390x only since the jvm uses more memory on that platform.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow tests to pass on s390x\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan existing tests on amd64 (little endian) and s390x (big endian)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix minor endianness issues in the following tests.\r\n\r\nArrayBasedMapBuilderSuite: The output of the UnsafeRow.toString() is based on the underlying bytes and is endian dependent. Add an expected value for big endian platforms. Add an expected value for big endian platforms.\r\n\r\nWriteDistributionAndOrderingSuite: Casting the id of type Int to Long doesn't work on big endian platforms because the BucketFunction calls UnsafeRow.getLong() for that column. That happens to work on little endian since an int field is stored in the first 4 bytes of the 8 byte field so positive ints are layed out the same as positive longs ie. little endian order. On big endian, the layout of UnsafeRow int fields does not happen to match the layout of long fields for the same number. Change the type of the id column to Long so that it matches what BucketFunction expects. Change the type of the id column to Long so that it matches what BucketFunction expects.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAllow tests to pass on big endian platforms\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan existing tests on amd64 (little endian) and s390x (big endian)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the `dataType` of the `timestampTimeoutAttribute` from IntegerType to LongType to match the type of the timestamp.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the v1 state manager to work on big endian platforms. It fixes all failing v1 state manager related tests on big endian platforms that do not load checkpoint state that was generated in little endian format.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested with existing tests on amd64 (little endian) and s390x (big endian)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nClarify error message for `negativeScaleNotAllowedError` with user-facing error class\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRaise a more user-friendly error message when users attempt to use a negative precision for DecimalType when the Spark config `spark.sql.legacy.allowNegativeScaleOfDecimal` is not set. Previously an internal error was raised, which is not correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it affects the error class when users attempt to use a negative precision for DecimalType when the Spark config `spark.sql.legacy.allowNegativeScaleOfDecimal` is not set. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test in `DecimalSuite.scala`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a bunch of issues with SQL API docs for Scala and Java:\r\n- Removes the now defunct Connect API docs. The current SQL docs provide enough coverage.\r\n- Removes the following internal packages from the docs: `org.apache.spark.sql.artifact`, `org.apache.spark.sql.scripting`, and `org.apache.spark.sql.ml`.\r\n- Fixes the removal of the `org.apache.spark.error` and `org.apache.spark.sql.error` packages.\r\n- Marks a bunch of internal classes in the `org.apache.spark.sql` as `private[sql]` to remove them from the docs.\r\n- Moves the `TableValuedFunctionArgument` interface from `org.apache.spark.sql` to `org.apache.spark.sql.internal` because it kept showing up in the docs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReadable docs are important!\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual inspection of the Java and Scala docs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThese changes modify the `deleteRecursivelyUsingUnixNative` method in `JavaUtils.java` to not swallow `InterruptedException`s. The bulk of the changes in this PR relate to modifying the signatures of methods that directly or indirectly use `JavaUtils.deleteRecursivelyUsingUnixNative`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`JavaUtils.deleteRecursively` swallows `InterruptedException`s, and that can cause entire executor loss. Consider a streaming task running a streaming aggregation. It takes the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. It [writes](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/statefulOperators.scala#L720) all data to the state store, and then [reads](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/statefulOperators.scala#L732) this data back to emit it (in, say, Complete mode).\r\n2. With the RocksDB state store, it doesn't actually acquire any locks, perform any sleeping, etc. during (1). This means that if the query is cancelled and it is interrupted, it won't respond to the interrupt.\r\n3. After (1) is done, it [calls commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/statefulOperators.scala#L744) on the state store.\r\n4. In RocksDB, this turns into a call to `RocksDB::commit`, which can call [createSnapshot](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/RocksDB.scala#L879).\r\n5. In createSnapshot, [we call Utils.deleteRecursively](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/RocksDB.scala#L879) to make sure that the temporary directory into which we place the RocksDB checkpoint is empty.   \r\n6. In deleteRecursively, we [call deleteRecursivelyUsingUnixNative](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/common/utils/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/util/JavaUtils.java#L115) which issues an `rm -rf` and then [calls process.waitFor](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/common/utils/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/util/JavaUtils.java#L183), which declares that it could throw an InterruptedException.\r\n7. Unfortunately, deleteRecursivelyUsingUnixNative [indiscriminately catches all Exceptions](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/common/utils/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/util/JavaUtils.java#L184), which includes the `InterruptedException` potentially thrown by `process.waitFor`. Then, it rethrows an IOException.\r\n8. That IOException is caught [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fc9d7d92ec60cc21e8fd54562e702ea67cf01d3/common/utils/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/util/JavaUtils.java#L117), and a warning is logged. The interrupt has now been swallowed.\r\n\r\nA streaming task thread that misses this interrupted exception will now not exit. If it doesn't exit for 60 seconds, then the TaskReaper will kill the JVM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is fairly tricky to test; in fact, we don't exercise the code-path for `deleteRecursivelyUsingUnixNative` during testing on Apple Silicon, which made it hard for me.\r\n\r\nMy approach here was to modify `deleteRecursivelyUsingUnixNative` to explicitly sleep. Then, I called that method in a background thread, interrupting it from the test thread. If all went correctly, then the background thread _should_ have received an interrupt that it did not swallow, and the test thread could assert that that happened. You can see this test in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49796/commits/95577db37c9209e64034db2e22879590ae636020), but since it's an intrusive change, I have reverted it. Example output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] UtilsSuite:\r\n1. Starting thread\r\n2. Waiting for it to get to its sleep\r\n3. Going to spawn rm -rf\r\n4. Finished deleting directory\r\n5. Sleeping for 10 seconds\r\n6. Interrupting thread that is sleeping\r\n[info] - deleteRecursively throws InterruptedException (5 seconds, 18 milliseconds)\r\n7. Catching and rethrowing interrupted exception\r\n8. Thread exiting\r\n9. gotInterruptedException = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI validated that this test case I added _fails_ without my changes to fix the interrupt swallowing; you can check out that commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a retry of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41569 that implements to use large variable types within PySpark everywhere.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39572 implemented the core logic but it only supports large variable types in the bold cases below:\r\n\r\n- `mapInArrow`: **JVM -> Python -> JVM**\r\n- Pandas UDF/Function API: **JVM -> Python** -> JVM\r\n- createDataFrame with Arrow: Python -> JVM\r\n- toPandas with Arrow: JVM -> Python\r\n\r\nThis PR completes them all.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo consistently support the large variable types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.execution.arrow.useLargeVarTypes` is not released out yet so it doesn't affect any end users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests with `spark.sql.execution.arrow.useLargeVarTypes` enabled.","created_at":"2025-02-04T09:54:19Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T23:57:57Z","closed_at":"2025-02-05T23:57:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0c1965e22d4e3e75617749fee85b887429de811","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce a fallback mechanism for Arrow-optimized Python UDFs when either the input or return types contain User-Defined Types (UDTs). If UDTs are detected, the system logs a warning and switches to currently default, non-Arrow-optimized UDF.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unblock enabling Arrow-optimized Python UDFs by default, see [pr](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49482)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. UDT input and output types will not fail Arrow Python UDF anymore, as shown below:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.sql.functions as F\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import Row\r\n>>> from pyspark.testing.sqlutils import ExamplePoint, ExamplePointUDT\r\n\r\n# UDT intput\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n>>> row = Row(label=1.0, point=ExamplePoint(1.0, 2.0))\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([row])\r\n>>> \r\n>>> udf1 = F.udf(lambda p: p.y, DoubleType(), useArrow=True)\r\n>>> df.select(udf1(df.point)).show()\r\n25/02/03 17:49:57 WARN ExtractPythonUDFs: Arrow optimization disabled due to UDT input or return type. Falling back to non-Arrow-optimized UDF execution.\r\n+---------------+                                                               \r\n|<lambda>(point)|\r\n+---------------+\r\n|            2.0|\r\n+---------------+\r\n\r\n# UDT output\r\n>>> row = Row(value=3.0)\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([row])\r\n>>> udf_with_udt_output = F.udf(lambda v: ExamplePoint(v, v + 1), ExamplePointUDT(), useArrow=True)\r\n>>> df.select(udf_with_udt_output(df.value)).show()\r\n25/02/03 17:51:43 WARN ExtractPythonUDFs: Arrow optimization disabled due to UDT input or return type.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` to the Spark Connect Scala Client. While this is a deprecated feature, we still believe it is useful to support it to ensure we reduce incompatibilities between classic and connect.\r\n\r\nImplementation wise I opted to convert the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` to an `Aggregator`, and use that code path for execution. This is probably not as fast as the original implementation (more allocations).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis reduces friction between the classic and connect implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It enabled Spark Connect Scala Client users to use `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`s.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe observed that when the python process is stuck during initialization (sending init configs, e.g. serialized python function), the jvm has no way to know. As a result, there are cases of the jvm stuck at `dataIn.readInt()` ƒrom a stuck python process. Then the job won't be showing as failed, although no queries are successfully started.\r\n\r\nHere we add a timeout for this socket during initialization so we fail fast.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark Connect improvement\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nI can't find a way to write a integration test, so I test it by manually setting the timeout from jvm side to 5 seconds, and let the python foreach_batch_worker to sleep for 30 sec in this PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49783\r\n\r\nAnd I was able to see the error:\r\n```\r\n>>> q = df.writeStream.foreachBatch(feb2).trigger(processingTime=\"30 seconds\").start()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/readwriter.py\", line 656, in start\r\n    return self._start_internal(\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/readwriter.py\", line 625, in _start_internal\r\n    (_, properties, _) = self._session.client.execute_command(cmd)\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1121, in execute_command\r\n    data, _, metrics, observed_metrics, properties = self._execute_and_fetch(\r\n                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1533, in _execute_and_fetch\r\n    for response in self._execute_and_fetch_as_iterator(\r\n  File \"/Users/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1510, in _execute_and_fetch_as_iterator\r\n    self._handle_error(error)\r\n  File \"/Users/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1784, in _handle_error\r\n    self._handle_rpc_error(error)\r\n  File \"/Users/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1860, in _handle_rpc_error\r\n    raise convert_exception(\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.SparkConnectGrpcException: (org.apache.spark.api.python.StreamingPythonRunner$StreamingPythonRunnerInitializationTimeoutException) [STREAMING_PYTHON_RUNNER_INITIALIZATION_TIMEOUT_FAILURE] Streaming Runner initialization failed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `Unstable` from `SparkSessionExtensionsProvider` trait from Apache Spark 4.1.0.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/400e2b29caf43b443f2e0c42aee92c4d0e3e0eb7/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSessionExtensionsProvider.scala#L78-L81\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.2.0, we provide `SparkSessionExtensionsProvider` trait without any change to allow third-party developers to provide a resource file that contains default extensions.\r\n- #32515\r\n\r\nApache Iceberg has been using this since 0.11.0.\r\n- https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.7.1/spark-configuration/#sql-extensions\r\n    > Iceberg 0.11.0 and later add an extension module to Spark to add new SQL commands, like CALL for stored procedures or ALTER TABLE ... WRITE ORDERED BY.\r\n\r\nAlthough `SparkSessionExtensions` is an unstable developer API, `SparkSessionExtensionsProvider` trait itself and ServiceLoader framework is stable and it's unlikely for Apache Spark to change this `trait`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/400e2b29caf43b443f2e0c42aee92c4d0e3e0eb7/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSessionExtensions.scala#L106-L109\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, cloud store client audit context is set to the\r\nsame context string as the Hadoop IPC context.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCallerContext adds information about the spark task to hadoop IPC context and then to HDFS, YARN and HBase server logs.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to update the cloud storage \"audit context\".\r\nStorage clients can attach the audit information to requests to be stored in the service's own logs, where it can be retrieved, parsed and used for analysis.\r\n\r\nIt is currently supported by the S3A connector, which adds the information to a synthetic referrer header, which is then stored in the S3 Server logs. (Not cloudtrail, sadly).\r\n\r\nSee [S3A Auditing](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/auditing.html)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n \r\nIf enabled, it adds extra entries in cloud storage server logs through cloud\r\nstorage clients which support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExpanded existing test `\"Set Spark CallerContext\"` to verify\r\nfull setting of passed down parameters to caller and audit contexts.\r\nThis required extracting the functional code of `CallerContext.setCurrentContext`\r\ninto a `@VisibleForTesting private[util]` method `setCurrentContext(Boolean)`\r\n\r\nWithout this, the test suite only ran if the process had been launched\r\nwith the configuration option `\"hadoop.caller.context.enabled` being set\r\nto true -this is not the default, so the existing test suite code\r\nwas probably never executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

When creating a serializer for `ExpressionEncoder`, the following elements are wrapped with `ValidateExternalType` by `SerializerBuildHelper.validateAndSerializeElement`:\r\n   - Element type of ArrayEncoder\r\n   - Element type of IterableEncoder\r\n   - Key type of MapEncoder\r\n   - Value type of MapEncoder\r\n3. `ValidateExternalType` attempts to validate using `Set`, which is equivalent to `scala.collection.immutable.Set` (regardness of Scala 2.12 / 2.13).\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> :paste\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoder\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.{GenericInternalRow, UnsafeRow}\r\n\r\nimport scala.collection.mutable\r\nimport scala.reflect.runtime.universe.TypeTag\r\n\r\ndef test[T: TypeTag](value: T): UnsafeRow = {\r\n  val encoder = ExpressionEncoder[T]\r\n  val projection = GenerateUnsafeProjection.generate(encoder.serializer, subexpressionEliminationEnabled = true)\r\n  val inputRow = new GenericInternalRow(1)\r\n  inputRow(0) = value\r\n  projection(inputRow)\r\n}\r\n\r\nval set: collection.Set[Int] = mutable.Set(1, 2)\r\n\r\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoder\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.{GenericInternalRow, UnsafeRow}\r\nimport scala.collection.mutable\r\nimport scala.reflect.runtime.universe.TypeTag\r\ntest: [T](value: T)(implicit evidence$1: reflect.runtime.universe.TypeTag[T])org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeRow\r\nset: scala.collection.Set[Int] = Set(1, 2)\r\n\r\nscala> test(set)\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeRow = [0,1000000018,2,0,200000001]\r\n\r\nscala> test(Array(set))\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: scala.collection.mutable.HashSet is not a valid external type for schema of array<int>\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.Invoke_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.MapObjects_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.MapObjects_1$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n  at test(<pastie>:43)\r\n  ... 51 elided\r\n\r\nscala> test(Seq(set))\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: scala.collection.mutable.HashSet is not a valid external type for schema of array<int>\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.Invoke_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.MapObjects_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.MapObjects_1$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n  at test(<pastie>:43)\r\n  ... 51 elided\r\n\r\nscala> test(Map(set -> 1))\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: scala.collection.mutable.HashSet is not a valid external type for schema of array<int>\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.Invoke_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.MapObjects_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.ExternalMapToCatalyst_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n  at test(<pastie>:43)\r\n  ... 51 elided\r\n\r\nscala> test(Map(1 -> set))\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: scala.collection.mutable.HashSet is not a valid external type for schema of array<int>\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.Invoke_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.MapObjects_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.ExternalMapToCatalyst_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n  at test(<pastie>:43)\r\n  ... 51 elided\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes.

Ahmed Hussein <ahussein@apache.org>\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a label to the UDFS expression to allow identifying the UDF expressions.\r\n\r\nApache Spark's User-Defined Functions (UDFs) are critical for extending SQL functionality, but tracking their performance historically required manual effort. This PR introduces labels to UDF expressions for improved identification and performance analysis. Here's a structured breakdown:\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- The proposed label format: `$name:UDF(${children.mkString(\", \")})` Example: `plusOne:UDF(5)` for a UDF named `plusOne` with input `5`\r\n- By looking at the log-history, explain-string used to include a udf label `s\"UDF:$name\"` at some point https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/9f523d3192c71a728fd8a2a64f52bbc337f2f026 , then it was removed in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/fe3e34dda68fd54212df1dd01b8acb9a9bc6a0ad\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Purpose of UDF Labeling\r\n  - Performance Analysis: Labels allow automated extraction of UDF usage metrics from Spark event logs, enabling cluster performance evaluation and optimization opportunities.\r\n  - Debugging/Observability: Identifies UDFs in query plans and logs (e.g., EXPLAIN output), helping diagnose non-deterministic behavior or bottlenecks.\r\n  - Version/Proprietary Tracking: Distinguishes custom UDFs from built-in functions, especially when using version-specific or proprietary implementations\r\n\r\n- Use Cases enbaled\r\n  - Event Log Analysis: Aggregate UDF execution times across jobs to identify slow functions.\r\n  - Query Plan Optimization: Detect redundant UDF calls in Spark SQL plans.\r\n  - Compliance Auditing: Track usage of deprecated or unauthorized UDFs\r\n\r\n### WIP Consideration:\r\n\r\nGet the community feedback regarding:\r\n\r\n- Label Format Preferences:\r\n  - Alternatives like `UDF:$name(...)` vs. `name:UDF(...)`; or\r\n  - To include the type of the UDF: `ScalaUDF`, `HiveUDF`, `PyUDF`..etc.\r\n- Including additional metadata (e.g., determinism flags).\r\n- Impact on Column Names:\r\n  - Ensure labels don’t conflict with existing column aliases.\r\n  - Avoid exposing sensitive UDF logic in production logs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the UDF expression strings appear in a different format:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n\r\n    val udf1 = spark.udf.register(udf1Name, (n: Int) => n + 1)\r\n    val udf2 = spark.udf.register(udf2Name, (n: Int) => n * 1)\r\n    val df = sql(\"SELECT myUdf1(myUdf2(1))\")\r\n    df.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n| myUdf1:UDF(myUdf2:UDF(1))|\r\n|--------|\r\n| 2 |\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal it will show up as:\r\n\r\n| myUdf1(myUdf2(1))|\r\n|--------|\r\n| 2 |\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated the unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2025-02-03T17:34:57Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T17:43:50Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12b9bb8dfd88cb648d198afa54352fbff0414b75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad97b7ac6fbcf20ac4c31dc589d317f85a600941","head":{"label":"amahussein:aspark-43131","ref":"aspark-43131","sha":"ad97b7ac6fbcf20ac4c31dc589d317f85a600941","user":{"login":"amahussein","id":50450311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDUwMzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50450311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein","html_url":"https://github.com/amahussein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627161460,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWG5dA","name":"spark","full_name":"amahussein/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amahussein","id":50450311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDUwMzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50450311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein","html_url":"https://github.com/amahussein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amahussein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amahussein/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn UnsafeRowUtils.validateStructuralIntegrityWithReasonImpl, when checking if the unused bits in the field are all zeros for fixed length fields, add functions that work on big endian platforms.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current checks only work on little endian platforms. This change detects the platform endianness once when the getPadding* functions are initialized and sets it to the proper implementation for the platform so there should be no significant change in performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis was tested on amd64 (little-endian) and s390x (big-endian) with existing unit tests. On s390x, many existing tests fail in the SQL projects.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a partial revert of the original PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48962 that introduced the resolution of default session level collation for DDL and DML queries.\r\nThe part that is reverted is the default collation resolution for DML queries, whereas the part that is kept is the default collation resolution for DDL queries, which is required to apply the object level collation that was introduced as part of PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49084. As part of this logic, object level collation is now applied to DDL queries accordingly, with the main logic implemented in ResolveDefaultStringTypes.stringTypeForDDLCommand() method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs there were some unresolved technical issues when attempting to merge the functionality from PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48962 on Delta side, due to its effect on DML queries, it was decided to pause this functionality for now, thus partially reverting unused parts for maintaining a cleaner code moving forward.\r\nAlso, this is inline with customer feedback where object level collation is much more requested functionality, so the focus is to introduce the resolution of object level collation for DDL queries instead, allowing the collation to be specified per table or view on their creation or modification, with propagating the default collation specified to subsequent queries on top of those entities.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests that cover the collations functionality, as well adding new dedicated tests for applying object level collation to the underlying columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.enabled` by default for Apache Spark 4.1.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe have been using `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.enabled` since Apache Spark 3.3.0 stably to improve Spark performance on V2 data source. Although Apache Spark enables this configuration, Spark checks if all `InputPartition`s have `HasPartitionKey` or not still.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8fc6a200eb533369c7c073e2abe585848a7168c3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/v2/DataSourceV2ScanExecBase.scala#L140-L142\r\n\r\n###
