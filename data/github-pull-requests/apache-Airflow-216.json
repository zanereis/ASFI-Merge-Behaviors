was a method on the DAG class called `sub_dag()` that had nothing\nto do with Sub-DAGs or the SubDagOperator - It instead created a new\n\"partial\" dag that contained only a selected subset of tasks.\n\nTo remove this confusion when seeing `dag.sub_dag()` used in code I have\nrenamed this function, and included a compat shim in case anyone is\nusing it outside of Airflow core.\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

Airflow 2.0 we decided to split Airlow into separate providers.\r\nthis means that when you prepare core airflow package, providers\r\nare not installed by default. This is not very convenient for\r\nlocal development though and for docker images built from sources,\r\nwhere you would like to install all providers by default.\r\n\r\nA new INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES environment variable controls\r\nthis behaviour now. It is is set to \"true\", all packages including\r\nprovider packages are installed. If missing or set to false, only\r\nthe core provider package is installed.\r\n\r\nFor Breeze, the default is set to \"true\", as for those cases you\r\nwant to install all providers in your environment. Similarly if you\r\nbuild the production image from sources. However when you build\r\nimage using github tag or pip package, you should specify\r\nappropriate extras to install the required provider packages.\r\n\r\nNote that if you install Airflow via 'pip install .' from sources\r\nin local virtualenv, provider packages are not going to be\r\ninstalled unless you set INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES to \"true\".\r\n\r\nFixes #11489\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept the following PR that\r\n\r\nAdd the KafkaProducerHook.\r\nAdd the KafkaConsumerHook.\r\nAdd the KafkaSensor which listens to messages with a specific topic.\r\nRelated Issue:\r\n#1311\r\n\r\nIssue link: AIRFLOW-6786\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\nDescription above provides context of the change\r\nCommit message/PR title starts with [AIRFLOW-NNNN]. AIRFLOW-NNNN = JIRA ID*\r\nUnit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\nCommits follow \"How to write a good git commit message\"\r\nRelevant documentation is updated including usage instructions.\r\nI will engage committers as explained in Contribution Workflow Example.\r\nFor document-only changes commit message can start with [AIRFLOW-XXXX].\r\nReminder to contributors:\r\n\r\nYou must add an Apache License header to all new files\r\nPlease squash your commits when possible and follow the 7 rules of good Git commits\r\nI am new to the community, I am not sure the files are at the right place or missing anything.\r\n\r\nThe sensor could be used as the first node of a dag where the second node can be a TriggerDagRunOperator. The messages are polled in a batch and the dag runs are dynamically generated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNote, as per denied PR #1415, it is important to mention these integrations are not suitable for low-latency/high-throughput/streaming.

that by splitting the tests into many small jobs has a bad\r\neffect - since we only have queue size = 180 for the whole Apache\r\norganisation, we are competing with other projects for the jobs\r\nand with the jobs being so short we got starved much more than if\r\nwe had long jobs. Therefore we are re-combining the test types into\r\nsingle jobs per Python version/Database version and run all the\r\ntests sequentially on those machines.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

simple script will help generate the Changelog for the 2.0 release. Because this release covers 5,000 pull requests over two years, it isn't feasible to generate the changelog automatically. There's too much noise in the data.\r\n\r\nInstead, this PR includes all pull requests merged into `master` and `v1-10-test` branches since they first split in June of 2018. Running `changelog.py` will generate a list of changes included in `master` which weren't already merged into `v1-10-test`. This is roughly 3,800 merges.\r\n\r\nThe results are parsed to search for ~45 key terms (or rather, their prefixes). Half of the terms are \"skippable\", indicating that results including these terms will be skipped in the output. These are unlikely to belong in the changelog. The other half of the terms are marked \"groupable\". The unfiltered results will then be printed out, grouped by the appropriate \"groupable\" term. This should make it easier to skim results and determine if they belong in the changelog.\r\n\r\nFinally, the counts of all skippable and countable terms will be printed out.\r\n\r\nTo change the configuration of \"skippable\" and \"countable\" terms, just update the `skippable_terms` and `groupable_terms` lists.\r\n\r\nThe script can be run by opening the `/dev` directory in the Airflow repo, and running the Python script.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python

PR adds dependencies between postgres/mysql/sqlite jobs\r\nwhich is the simplest way to avoid starvation of job cancelling.\r\n\r\nCurrently several PRs with > 120 jobs might easily saturate the\r\nqueue of requests and it means that when there are many PRs\r\nqueueing, they might starve \"workflow_run\" jobs - those jobs\r\nare responsible for cancelling other duplicate/failed requests,\r\nso if they are not run for a while the jobs that should be\r\ncancelled might be cancelled much later than they should,\r\nprobably already when they used a lot of build time.\r\n\r\nBy adding dependencies between the different database tests,\r\nwe are adding a bit artifficial delays between the steps - this\r\nmeans that a single PR mght run slower, but it also means that\r\nit will not starve cancel jobs from the new PRs and they might\r\nhave a chance to clean the duplicate/failed jobs more efficiently.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

of now, the logic to mark DAGs inactive is out of the `_run_scheduler_loop` which never runs unless `num_runs` is configured, so have to move it inside the `_run_scheduler_loop` method.\r\n\r\nAlso currently, it relies on Scheduler's loop start time to figure out which all DAGs needed to be marked inactive, something which won't work in a Scheduler HA setup, as each Scheduler would be processing a small number of DAGs only. To solve that, I've introduced a timeout config with a default value of 10mins, so a deleted DAG would be visible up to 10mins on UI, but that's better to wrongly mark some active DAGs as inactive or not marking them at all. \r\n\r\nPS: Will write unit tests if the approach looks good.
