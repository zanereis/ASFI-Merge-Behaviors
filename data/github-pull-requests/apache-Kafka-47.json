ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15046\r\n\r\n- While any blocking operation under holding the UnifiedLog.lock could lead to serious performance (even availability) issues, currently there are several paths that calls fsync(2) inside the lock\r\n  * In the meantime the lock is held, all subsequent produces against the partition may block\r\n  * This easily causes all request-handlers to be busy on bad disk performance\r\n  * Even worse, when a disk experiences tens of seconds of glitch (it's not rare in spinning drives), it makes the broker to unable to process any requests with unfenced from the cluster (i.e. \"zombie\" like status)\r\n- This PR gets rid of 4 cases of essentially-unnecessary fsync(2) calls performed under the lock:\r\n  * (1) ProducerStateManager.takeSnapshot at UnifiedLog.roll\r\n      - I moved fsync(2) call to the scheduler thread as part of existing \"flush-log\" job (before incrementing recovery point)\r\n      - Since it's still ensured that the snapshot is flushed before incrementing recovery point, this change shouldn't cause any problem\r\n  * (2) ProducerStateManager.removeAndMarkSnapshotForDeletion as part of log segment deletion\r\n      - This method calls `Utils.atomicMoveWithFallback` with `needFlushParentDir = true` internally, which calls fsync.\r\n      - I changed it to call `Utils.atomicMoveWithFallback` with `needFlushParentDir = false` (which is consistent behavior with index files deletion. index files deletion also doesn't flush parent dir)\r\n      - This change shouldn't cause problems neither.\r\n  * (3) LeaderEpochFileCache.truncateFromStart when incrementing log-start-offset\r\n      - This path is called from deleteRecords on request-handler threads.\r\n      - Here, we don't need fsync(2) either actually.\r\n      - On unclean shutdown, few leader epochs might be remained in the file but it will be [handled by LogLoader](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3f4816dd3eafaf1a0636d3ee689069f897c99e28/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LogLoader.scala#L185) on start-up so not a problem\r\n  * (4) LeaderEpochFileCache.truncateFromEnd as part of log truncation\r\n      - Likewise, we don't need fsync(2) here, since any epochs which are untruncated on unclean shutdown will be handled on log loading procedure\r\n- Please refer JIRA ticket for the further details and the performance experiment result\r\n\r\nTo check if these changes don't cause a problem, below consistency expectation table will be helpful:\r\n\r\n| No | File                  | Consistency expectation

procedure                                                                |\r\n| 2  | ProducerStateSnapshot | Deleted snapshot files on the disk should be eventually consistent with log segments                                                        | - On log segment deletion by any reasons (e.g. retention, topic deletion), corresponding snapshot files will be deleted.<br>- Even when the broker crashes by power failure before the files are deleted from the actual disk, they should be eventually deleted from the disk.          |

     | On the other hand, surplus entries (prefixes or suffixes) in the checkpoint file on the disk are acceptable, because even on restart after power failure, it will be truncated anyways on log loading procedure. |\r\n\r\nWe can confirm the changes are valid based on above table like this:\r\n\r\n- Change (1): fsync for ProducerStateManager.takeSnapshot is moved to the async scheduler thread\r\n  * This preserves consistency expectation No.1, since we still increment recovery point only after fsync is performed\r\n- Change (2): ProducerStateManager.removeAndMarkSnapshotForDeletion no longer flushes parent dir\r\n  * This preserves consistency expectation No.2, since snapshot files will be deleted eventually even after power failure.\r\n      - ScenarioA: Snapshot files are renamed to `-deleted` for segment deletion by log retention, but broker crashes by power failure before the rename is persisted to the disk\r\n          * In this case, some snapshot files's name would be reverted to `-deleted` suffix stripped, then ProducerStateManager would load these snapshot files unnecessarily.\r\n          * However, since producer state will be truncated based on log-segment upon log loading procedure, it won't be a problem.\r\n      - ScenarioB: Snapshot files are renamed to `-deleted` for topic deletion, but broker crashes by power failure before the rename is persisted to the disk\r\n          * Also, in this case, snapshot file's name would be reverted to `-deleted` suffix stripped.\r\n          * However, on topic-deletion, parent log-dir is already renamed to `-delete` and it's fsynced anyways, the revert of snapshot file wouldn't be a problem. Parent log dirs will be deleted anyways after resuming topic deletion procedure.\r\n- Change (3): LeaderEpochFileCache.truncateFromStart doesn't call fsync\r\n  * This preserves consistency expectation No.3, since we still call fsync on LeaderEpochFileCache.assign.\r\n- Change (4): LeaderEpochFileCache. truncateFromEnd doesn't call fsync\r\n  * Same explanation as Change (3)\r\n\r\n###

test uses a standalone worker to verify the behavior of the plugin.discovery configuration values with non-migrated and migrated artifacts. \r\n\r\nFor a source of non-migrated artifacts, I'm getting the latest 3.5.x File connectors, which will not receive manifests. When I originally planned this testing, I thought I would add non-migrated connectors to the `test-plugins` artifact, but that would make it difficult for downstream projects to import that jar and run in hybrid_fail.\r\n\r\nThe templates are changed to provide the default `service_load` to hopefully speed up execution of the other system tests.\r\n\r\nThis test verifies that:\r\n1. Backwards-compatible modes (only_scan and hybrid_warn) start up successfully and the file connectors are visible.\r\n2. The hybrid_fail mode crashes the worker if and only if non-migrated plugins are present.\r\n3. The service_load mode starts up successfully, and file connectors are visible if and only if they are migrated.\r\n4. The dry-run does not migrate connectors.\r\n5. The sync-manifest writes well-formed jars that are readable during worker startup.\r\n\r\nThe test runtime is <5m on my machine. I considered adding no-command and `list` cases, but thought they duplicated the `--dry-run` case and increased the runtime for very little added value. I did change the distributed template and the ConnectDistributedService so that they could run this same test, but didn't set up a matrix for the deployment type for the same reason.\r\n\r\nI did not include migrations for other plugin types (converters, transforms, etc) or packaging styles (class hierarchy, single-jar) because this is already covered in unit tests. I did not include assertions for the WARN log statements printed during hybrid modes for the same reason.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-16T23:37:05Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T22:28:43Z","closed_at":"2023-08-18T22:28:43Z","merged_at":"2023-08-18T22:28:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"82ae77f94566881d957929acbdc3197e60f7f5f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

Kafka Streams only tries to purge records whose offset are committed from a repartition topic when at least one offset was committed in the current commit. The coupling between committing some offsets and purging records is not needed and might delay purging of records. For example, if a in-flight call for purging records has not completed yet when a commit happens, a new call\r\nis not issued.\r\nIf then the earlier in-flight call for purging records finally completes but the next commit does not commit any offsets, Streams does not issue the call for purging records whose offset were committed in the previous commit because the purging call was still in-flight.\r\n\r\nThis change issues calls for purging records during any commit if the purge interval passed, even if no offsets were committed in the current commit.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix.

a non-empty log the KRaft leader only notifies the listener of leadership when it has read to the leader's epoch start offset. This guarantees that the leader epoch has been committed and that the listener has read all committed offsets/records.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the KRaft leader doesn't do this when the log is empty. When the log is empty the listener is notified immediately when it has become leader. This makes the API inconsistent and harder to program against.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes that by having the KRaft leader wait for the listener's nextOffset to be greater than the leader's epochStartOffset before calling handleLeaderChange.\r\n\r\nThe RecordsBatchReader implementation is also changed to include control records. This makes it possible for the state machine learn about committed control records. This additional information can be used to compute the committed offset or for counting those bytes when determining when to snapshot the partition.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

PR contains three main changes:\r\n\r\n* Support for transactions in MetadataLoader\r\n* Abort in-progress transaction during controller failover\r\n* Utilize transactions for ZK to KRaft migration \r\n\r\nA new MetadataBatchLoader class is added to decouple the loading of record batches from the publishing of metadata in MetadataLoader. Since a transaction can span across multiple batches (or multiple transactions could exist within one batch), some buffering of metadata updates was needed before publishing out to the MetadataPublishers. MetadataBatchLoader accumulates changes into a MetadataDelta, and uses a callback to publish to the publishers when needed.\r\n\r\nOne small oddity with this approach is that since we can \"splitting\" batches in some cases, the number of bytes returned in the LogDeltaManifest has new semantics. The number of bytes included in a batch is now only included in the _last_ metadata update that is published as a result of a batch.

the QuorumController side of KRaft metadata transactions.\r\nAs specified in KIP-868, this PR creates a new metadata version, IBP_3_6_IV1, which contains the\r\nthree new records: AbortTransactionRecord, BeginTransactionRecord, EndTransactionRecord.\r\n\r\nIn order to make offset management unit-testable, this PR moves it out of QuorumController and into\r\nOffsetControlManager. The general approach here is to track the \"last stable offset,\" which is the\r\ncalculated by looking at the latest committed offset and the in-progress transaction (if any). When\r\na transaction is aborted, we revert back to this last stable offset. We also revert back to it when\r\nthe controller is transitioning from active to inactive.\r\n\r\nIn a follow-up PR, we will add support for the transaction records in MetadataLoader. We will also\r\nadd support for automatically aborting pending transactions after a controller failover.","created_at":"2023-08-13T13:31:47Z","updated_at":"2023-08-14T23:58:59Z","closed_at":"2023-08-14T23:58:56Z","merged_at":"2023-08-14T23:58:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"adc16d0f310dc1350bca66d5da013d599b990cfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/845222618c26aa2147002a98761e8773ae4903ef","head":{"label":"cmccabe:txn3","ref":"txn3","sha":"845222618c26aa2147002a98761e8773ae4903ef","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch fixes an issue for ZK controllers where we were emitting the ZkMigrationState enum rather than a value. This can lead to downstream failures with JMX metrics since the RMI protocol will marshal the ZkMigrationState object returned by the gauge. Any downstream consumer of this metric (like jconsole or a metrics exporter) will not be able to unmarshal the value since the ZkMigrationState class will not be present. \r\n\r\nThe fix is simply to emit the byte value of this enum.","created_at":"2023-08-12T13:17:52Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T19:30:10Z","closed_at":"2023-08-15T19:30:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78487ab0b790dc87fddb7eb9e1c8f4d91ea0cc22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/b75a930ee9fa33eaeefa99d400f1d5d8afb4897c","head":{"label":"mumrah:minor-fix-zk-migration-state-metric","ref":"minor-fix-zk-migration-state-metric","sha":"b75a930ee9fa33eaeefa99d400f1d5d8afb4897c","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

part 1 introduced the callback request type. It is used to execute a callback after KafkaApis.handle has returned. We did not account for tryCompleteActions at the end of handle when making this change.\r\n\r\nIn tests, we saw produce p99 increase dramatically (likely because we have to wait for another request before we can complete DelayedProduce). As a result, we should add the tryCompleteActions after the callback as well. In testing, this improved the produce performance.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

is the secondary component of KIP-898, a command to migrate released artifacts to include ServiceLoader manifests.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide dry-run functionality and to reduce the number of write operations to the filesystem, the script will accumulate the changes to the manifests in-memory. Once the changes to manifests are completely known, the script can then generate the new manifest files, dry run the sync, and if the dry-run flag is omitted, actually write the changes to disk.\r\n\r\nIn order to model the state of the manifests in-memory and the operations on manifest files, replace the existing ManifestEntry and Map system with the `ManifestWorkspace`. Each overall workspace has several `SourceWorkspace` objects, one corresponding to each PluginSource. The `SourceWorkspace` is an abstraction over the several different types of plugin sources, which each have different semantics around reading and writing manifests.\r\n\r\nThe actual JAR editing is done by opening the JAR files as a FileSystem, and then using normal file write operations on the internal URL. This allows code reuse between the Class Hierarchy and Single/Multi jar cases, and means that we're using the existing zip/jar libraries instead of binary editing.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

- Introduce a new internal config flag to enable processing threads\r\n - If enabled, create a scheduling task manager inside the normal task manager (renamings will be added on top of this), and use it from the stream thread\r\n - All operations inside the task manager that change task state, lock the corresponding tasks if processing threads are enabled.\r\n - Adds a new abstract class `AbstractPartitionGroup`. We can modify the underlying implementation depending on the synchronization requirements. `PartitionGroup` is the unsynchronized subclass that is going to be used by the original code path. The processing thread code path uses a trivially synchronized `SynchronizedPartitionGroup` that uses object monitors. Further down the road, there is the opportunity to implement a weakly synchronized alternative. The details are complex, but since the implementation is essentially a queue + some other things, it should be feasible to implement this lock-free.\r\n - Refactorings in `StreamThreadTest`: Make all tests use the thread member variable and add `tearDown` in order avoid thread leaks and simplify debugging.

Builds are exiting while running the tests. After going through various builds here is what I found - \r\n\r\n- Clients which ever aren't closed while running the tests are trying to connect to the broker even when broker got shutdown. And when a gradle worker starts running on the same port which is a system assigned port as gradle by default bind a worker to port:0 and if broker was running previously it starts accepting the connection from the hanging clients and result in MessageIOException and eventually gradle worker starts shutting down with a ConnectException. All the tests expect MetadataQuorumCommandTest may be the reason for this. \r\n \r\n- Whenever the build initiates the shutdown process it starts removing the shutdown hooks and these shutdown hooks can only be removed when all the executing threads were able to gracefully shutdown. But few tests in MetadataQuorumCommandTest aren't able to catch the InterruptSignal and resulting in failure of removing shutdown hooks.\r\n\r\nThese two issues are mainly contributing for the build failures.

Jenkinsfile is currently configured to do testing with the `unitTest` and `integrationTest` tasks, instead of the `test` task. These tasks use JUnit test category filters to distinguish between integration and non-integration tests. Because of https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3077, if a JUnit test category filter is used, Mockito does not report unused stubbings. As a result, our CI builds currently don't catch unused stubbings.\r\n\r\nAlthough an upstream fix has been implemented with https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/3078, a release has not yet been published with that fix. Even when a new release is published, it will take place on the 5.x.y line, which requires JDK 11+ (see the [5.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v5.0.0)).\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we can switch to using the `test` task instead of the `unitTest` and `integrationTest` tasks. If there are benefits to the two-task approach, we can revert to that approach once we begin work on Kafka 4.0 (which drops support for Java 8) and upgrade to a version of Mockito with the fix.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including

title, we discovered a flaky bug during testing that the commit request manager would seldomly throw a NOT_COORDINATOR exception, which means the request was routed to a non-coordinator node.  We discovered that if we don't check the coordinator node in the commitRequestManager, the request manager will pass on an empty node to the NetworkClientDelegate, which implies the request can be sent to any node in the cluster.  This behavior is incorrect as the commit requests need to be routed to a coordinator node.\r\n\r\nBecause the timing coordinator's discovery during integration testing isn't entirely deterministic; therefore, the test became extremely flaky. After fixing this: The coordinator node is mandatory before attempt to enqueue these commit request to the NetworkClient.","created_at":"2023-08-09T21:30:13Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T22:01:28Z","closed_at":"2023-08-15T22:01:28Z","merged_at":"2023-08-15T22:01:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"b97e8203eb1fb016cd7cccd3dbf5fecc716969be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5536940330,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSgcBKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ctr","name":"ctr","color":"554CC1","default":false,"description":"Consumer

`Classloader.registerAsParallelCapable()` call is intended to be called during static initialization. It must be called prior to the `Classloader` superconstructor, because there it is evaluated to decide whether the classloader instance created will be parallel capable.\r\n\r\nFor the entire lifetime of this test, the `Classloader.registerAsParallelCapable()` call has been in an instance initializer, which is executed after the superconstructor is finished. This has meant that the first `SynchronizedDelegatingClassLoader`, and the first `SynchronizedPluginClassLoader` created have erroneously been non-parallel-capable.\r\n\r\nHowever, this test did not flaky-fail until #14089 was merged, because the `SamplingConverter` was never located in the first `SynchronizedPluginClassLoader`. With that PR, the `TestPlugins.pluginPath(TestPlugins.TestPlugin...)` function was changed to return a Set instead of a List. This meant that the `SamplingConverter` then _could_ appear in the first `SynchronizedPluginClassLoader`, and whenever that happened, the test would reproduce a deadlock and fail.\r\n\r\nSince there was only one `SynchronizedDelegatingClassLoader` created in this test, it was always non-parallel-capable. The test would only deadlock if _both_ classloaders were non-parallel-capable, which was not possible until recently.\r\n\r\nImportantly, this is only a bug in the test, as the real PluginClassLoader and DelegatingClassLoader have been parallel-capable since they were fixed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

key requirments got relaxed for the followinger streams dsl operator:\r\n\r\n- left join Kstream-Kstream: no longer drop left records with null-key and call ValueJoiner with 'null' for right value.\r\n- outer join Kstream-Kstream: no longer drop left/right records with null-key and call ValueJoiner with 'null' for right/left value.\r\n- left-foreign-key join Ktable-Ktable: no longer drop left records with null-foreign-key returned by the ForeignKeyExtractor and call ValueJoiner with 'null' for right value.\r\n- left join KStream-Ktable: no longer drop left records with null-key and call ValueJoiner with 'null' for right value.\r\n- left join KStream-GlobalTable: no longer drop records when KeyValueMapper returns 'null' and call ValueJoiner with 'null' for right value.\r\n\r\n### Repartitioning:\r\n\r\nIf a repartition node is upstream to any of the above listed operators then it may not filter null-key-records.\r\nThus, the new default behavior for repartiton nodes is to no longer filter out null-key-records.\r\nHowever, we would like to keep this optimization where possible.\r\nTherefore, during the 'buildAndOptimizeTopology' the graph gets traversed to look for repartition nodes which have none of the above listed operators downstream.\r\nThese nodes then get updated with the filter perdicate to filter out null-key-records.\r\n\r\n### Test Strategy:\r\n\r\nTests for each of the targeted dsl operator on minimal topologies plus extending some of the existing Integration tests (e.g. StreamStreamJoinIntegrationTest.java)\r\n\r\n### Misc:\r\n\r\nI suggest updating https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Streams+Join+Semantics after this has been merged.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-09T12:22:26Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T14:20:05Z","closed_at":"2023-10-31T16:09:43Z","merged_at":"2023-10-31T16:09:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5c24974ae2967824d1ec34b5b02121399a5e2f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

the controller, move publishing acls to the Authorizer into a dedicated MetadataPublisher, AclPublisher. This publisher listens for notifications from MetadataLoader, and receives only committed data.  This brings the controller side in line with how the broker has always worked. It also avoids some ugly code related to publishing directly from the QuorumController. Most important of all, it clears the way to implement metadata transactions without worrying about Authorizer state (since it will be handled by the MetadataLoader, along with other metadata image state).\r\n\r\nIn AclsDelta, we can remove isSnapshotDelta. We always know when the MetadataLoader is giving us a snapshot. Also bring AclsDelta in line with the other delta classes, where completeSnapshot calculates the diff between the previous\r\nimage and the next one. We don't use this delta (since we just apply the image directly to the authorizer) but we should\r\nhave it, for consistency.\r\n\r\nFinally, change MockAclMutator to avoid the need to subclass

While migrating tests from EasyMock / PowerMock to Mockito (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7438), we've been using Mockito's [strict stubs functionality](https://www.javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.11.0/org/mockito/quality/Strictness.html#STRICT_STUBS) to help keep tests clean.\r\n- This patch applies the strict stubs rule to the rest of the Connect tests and cleans up unused stubs.\r\n- One notable test that has been skipped is the [ExactlyOnceWorkerSourceTaskTest](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8dec3e66163420ee0c2c259eef6e0c0f3185ca17/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/ExactlyOnceWorkerSourceTaskTest.java#L120). This is because it is already using a separate JUnit runner and enabling strict stubs via the [MockitoJUnit rule](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#mockito_junit_rule) causes `UnnecessaryStubbingException` to be thrown even with unused stubs in the `@Before` method (i.e. any stubs setup there need to be used by every test). This doesn't occur when using the [MockitoJUnitRunner](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.11.0/org/mockito/junit/MockitoJUnitRunner.html); from the [docs here](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.11.0/org/mockito/exceptions/misusing/UnnecessaryStubbingException.html) - \r\n\r\n> Mockito JUnit Runner triggers UnnecessaryStubbingException only when none of the test methods use the stubbings. This means that it is ok to put default stubbing in a 'setup' method or in test class constructor. That default stubbing needs to be used at least once by one of the test methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-08T12:00:18Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T09:14:44Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T09:13:28Z","merged_at":"2023-08-09T09:13:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"f23394336a7741bf4eb23fcde951af0a23a69bd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

Per https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/KAFKA/issues/KAFKA-15291\r\n\r\nFollowing https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14863 the plugin scanning logic was updated to allow plugins to opt-in to the Versioned interface individually.\r\n\r\nAll subclasses of Coverter, HeaderConverter, Transformation, Predicate and ConnectorClientConfigOverridePolicy have been updated to implement Versioned.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added to ensure that the AppInfoParser.getVersion() is being called to provide the relevant version.\r\nExisting test classes implementing the subclasses have also been updated to ensure that the addition of versioned does not impact these test cases.\r\n\r\nStringConverter has been left un implemented so that the UNDEFINED_VERSION behaviour can be

do a couple of unnecessary deserialization and re-serialization steps. These steps are not just an unnecessary perf hit, but can even break the join for the case of scheme evaluation in which the serialized bytes[] might change breaking the \"record value hash comparison step\" when processing a subscription response.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all unnessary de-/re-serialization steps and change some FK-jon Processors to work on plain bytes[] instead.\r\n\r\n**Note: this is intended to be a POC PR only at this point; opened it to collect early feedback, to see if we believe it's a viable solution.** -- I also think that there is more unnecessary de/serialization going on that we could also remove. For example `SubscriptionReceiveProcessorSupplier` seem to unnecessarily deserialize the full payload but we would work with `Bytes/byte[]` types. (Not sure if there are more.) -- Last: I had the idea that we could also introduce a `RawXxxStore` interface that `MeteredXxxStore` would implement, to allow skipping the deserialization step on-read as an alternative solution.

new OffsetSyncStore historical translation cache clears more syncs than necessary when the gap between syncs is variable. This is a problem with the replacement promotion logic, which only covered the base case when promoting an one index to the immediately following index.\r\n\r\nThis has the effect that if a sync fails to satisfy an invariant for the following index, then it is discarded immediately, even if the value would satisfy the invariants at a different index. In particular, invariant B which enforces a maximum distance between two syncs gets more permissive as the index in the array increases, so a sync which does not satisfy invariant B at index 1 may satisfy it at index j > 1.\r\n\r\nInstead of the greedy discarding algorithm, the replacement promotion logic should keep a separate index into the potential replacements from the original array, and delay discarding a sync until it can be determined that the sync is not valid at any place in the array. In particular, syncs are certainly not worth keeping if they are duplicates of other syncs, or if they fail invariant C. Invariant C becomes more strict as the index in the array increases, so a sync which does not satisfy invariant C at index 1 will certainly never satisfy it at index j > 1.\r\n\r\nIn order to verify the changes, new tests which use Random to generate gaps between syncs, and generalize the test for maintaining unique syncs to an arbitrary stream of gaps. The different tests cover:\r\n\r\n1. Constant spacing\r\n2. Uniform random spacing between 0 and N\r\n3. Uniform random spacing between M and N with M > 0\r\n4. Bimodal spacing at maxOffsetLag and 2x maxOffsetLag\r\n\r\nThe new algorithm is an extension of the existing one, so all of the consistent-spacing tests have the exact same behavior.\r\n\r\n###

configuring RLMM, the configs passed into `configure` method is the `RemoteLogManagerConfig`. But in `RemoteLogManagerConfig`, there's no configs related to `remote.log.metadata.*`, ex: `remote.log.metadata.topic.replication.factor`. So, even if users have set the config in broker, it'll never be applied.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed the issue to allow users setting RLMM prefix: `remote.log.metadata.manager.impl.prefix` (default is `rlmm.config.`), and then, appending the desired `remote.log.metadata.*` configs, it'll pass into RLMM, including `remote.log.metadata.common.client.`/`remote.log.metadata.producer.`/ `remote.log.metadata.consumer.` prefixes.\r\n\r\nEx: \r\n```\r\n# default value\r\n# remote.log.storage.manager.impl.prefix=rsm.config.\r\n#

fix to avoid creating unnecessary standby tasks, especially when these may be surprising or unexpected as in the case of an application with `num.standby.replicas = 0` and warmup replicas disabled.\r\n\r\nThe \"bug\" here was introduced during the fix for an issue with cooperative rebalancing and in-memory stores. The fundamental problem is that in-memory stores cannot be unassigned from a consumer for any period, however temporary, without being closed and losing all the accumulated state. This caused some grief when the new HA task assignor would assign an active task to a node based on the readiness of the standby version of that task, but would have to remove the active task from the initial assignment so it could first be revoked from its previous owner, as per the cooperative rebalancing protocol. This temporary gap in any version of that task among the consumer's assignment for that one intermediate rebalance would end up causing the consumer to lose all state for it, in the case of in-memory stores.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we simply began to place standby tasks on the intended recipient of an active task awaiting revocation by another consumer. However, the fix was a bit of an overreach, as we assigned these temporary standby tasks in all cases, regardless of whether there had previously been a standby version of that task. We can narrow this down without sacrificing any of the intended functionality by only assigning this kind of standby task where the consumer had previously owned some version of it that would otherwise potentially be lost.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-04T01:10:45Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T21:51:54Z","closed_at":"2023-08-30T20:29:39Z","merged_at":"2023-08-30T20:29:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"95e1cdc4efbc720687cefad5bacd053565d03614","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cadonna","id":1042170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna","html_url":"https://github.com/cadonna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ace9ba42d6f50c674837cabfb84be585f803dd71","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:HOTFIX-avoid-unnecessary-standby-tasks","ref":"HOTFIX-avoid-unnecessary-standby-tasks","sha":"ace9ba42d6f50c674837cabfb84be585f803dd71","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

main motivation behind this change is to keep dependencies updated to the latest stable version of tools \r\nused to build and publish kafka, and one of the most of important tools is maven artifact\r\n\r\nHere is the release notes of maven artifact 3.9.4 https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.4/release-notes.html \r\n\r\nOne of of the big changes for this version is that java 8 is the minimum version required to use this version of maven \r\n\r\nThe build on local machine is working as perfectly, but we need to check the build on Jenkins \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade
