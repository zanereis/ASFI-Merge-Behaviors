additional parameters for `KafkaUnboundedReader.offsetConsumer`, added by BEAM-6285.\r\n\r\nIn `KafkaIO.read()`, there're two consumers running in the backend actually: \r\n1. `KafkaUnboundedReader.consumer`, which is the main consumer to read data from kafka topic(s); \r\n2. `KafkaUnboundedReader.offsetConsumer`, which is used to estimate backlog, by fetching the latest offset; \r\n\r\nBy default, `KafkaUnboundedReader.offsetConsumer` shares the same parameters with `KafkaUnboundedReader.consumer`, with a generated `ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG`(value is `%topicname_offset_consumer_%randonNumber_%groupId`). This may not work when the topic is secured in Kafka.\r\n\r\nIn this case with secured topics, you can add specific parameters for `KafkaUnboundedReader.offsetConsumer`, to overwrite parameters for `KafkaUnboundedReader.consumer`.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

now, RedisIO.Write supports write methods for string (APPEND, SET),\r\nlist (LPUSH, RPUSH) and HyperLogLog (PFADD), but not for set (SADD).\r\nThis PR adds it. In addition, I did the following refactoring in this:\r\n\r\n* make the input value check for port number stricter\r\n* replace a magic number indicating the end of a loop with a constant\r\n* remove an unnecessary argument from writeUsingHLLCommand,\r\n  which is a private method used only internally\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

change switches the ULR from using LocalFileSystemArtifact[Stager/Retrieval]Service to using BeamFileSystemArtifact[Staging/Retrieval]Service which has functionality to remove artifacts after running a job. With this change ValidatesRunner tests no longer leave huge amounts of artifacts when run with the ULR.\r\n\r\nOther code had to be changed to allow this switch. In particular, the old code would store the path to the staged files after creating the staging service. This code instead stores an artifact staging session token, to keep track of a specific staging session (since the job server may have multiple staging sessions from different jobs). The new code also has changes to correctly pass the artifact retrieval token (passed to the ReferenceRunner as part of a RunJobRequest) to the BeamFileSystemArtifactRetrievalService.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

a custom coder for strings in the Go SDK. CustomCoders are already length prefixed, so this does the simple conversion.\r\nThis PR also removes all places I could recall do a manual []byte to string conversion which was a consequence of the previous approach. This should yield a mild performance improvement in that the conversions are done earlier rather than right before invocation. Similarly, []bytes are no longer getting checked that they are strings.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

BEAM-6318 we suspect that Beam test suites sometimes become flaky during PyPi outages, and we are exploring adding retries as a mitigation. This PR increases the number of retries used by `pip` from 5(default) to 10. In `pip`, retries happen with a back-off. I verified on a VM without internet access that with 10 retries `pip` attempts to download a package throughout 4 minutes, while first 5 attempts happen within 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nIf pip retry mechanism proves not sufficient to mitigate BEAM-6318, we can issue multiple calls to `pip`, also with a back-off.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
