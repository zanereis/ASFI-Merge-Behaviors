upgrading from the release candidate :warning:</p>\n<h1>Breaking Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Naming around <code>JavaPackage</code> subpackages and dependencies has been improved to remove ambiguities. In general, whenever all classes from a package and subpackages recursively are involved, this is now called &quot;package tree&quot;. Otherwise, it only targets the classes directly within this package (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/919\">#919</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/968\">#968</a>; thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/grimsa\"><code>@​grimsa</code></a>)\nThe following mapping shows how to translate the old methods to the current methods:\n<ul>\n<li><code>getAllClasses()</code> -&gt; <code>getClassesInPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getAllSubpackages()</code> -&gt; <code>getSubpackagesInTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getClassDependenciesFromSelf()</code> -&gt; <code>getClassDependenciesFromThisPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getClassDependenciesToSelf()</code> -&gt; <code>getClassDependenciesToThisPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getPackageDependenciesFromSelf()</code> -&gt; <code>getPackageDependenciesFromThisPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getPackageDependenciesToSelf()</code> -&gt; <code>getPackageDependenciesToThisPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>accept(..)</code> -&gt; <code>traversePackageTree(..)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Importing the default package via <code>ClassFileImporter.importPackages(&quot;&quot;)</code> will now yields the same result as using <code>importClasspath()</code> without any <code>ImportOption</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/954\">#954</a>)</li>\n<li><code>ClassFileImporter.importClasspath()</code> now behaves consistently to other import APIs. I.e. no default <code>ImportOptions</code> like <code>DoNotIncludeArchives</code> are added anymore, instead all <code>ImportOptions</code> need to be added the same way as for all other import methods (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/958\">#958</a>)</li>\n<li>The custom collection <code>ImportOptions</code> has been removed from the public API and been replaced by a standard <code>Collection&lt;ImportOption&gt;</code> where appropriate (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/958\">#958</a>)</li>\n<li>The package <code>com.tngtech.archunit.library.plantuml</code> has been moved to <code>com.tngtech.archunit.library.plantuml.rules</code> to make room for adding other PlantUML related features (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/959\">#959</a>)</li>\n<li>SLF4J-API has been upgraded from <code>1.7.36</code> to <code>2.0.3</code>, so any log adapter dependency to be used with ArchUnit (e.g. to hook in Log4J) has to be compatible with SLF4J-API <code>2.x</code> from now on (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/966\">#966</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug where multiple synthetic access calls to methods like <code>access$123(..)</code> would lead to only one access being imported. Note, that these synthetic methods are added for calls to private fields / methods from inner classes to outer classes, etc. (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/957\">#957</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<h2>Lang</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>archunit_ignore_patterns.txt</code> is now also respected by <code>FreezingArchRule</code>. Thus, ignored violations are not added to the <code>ViolationStore</code> anymore (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/915\">#915</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Library</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>testClassesShouldResideInTheSamePackageAsImplementation(..)</code> now supports multiple test classes with same simple name (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/918\">#918</a>; thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/mslowiak\"><code>@​mslowiak</code></a>)</li>\n<li><code>PlantUmlArchCondition</code> now does not throw exceptions anymore, if a class is in none or multiple components, but instead reports those as standard violations. This way these violations can also be frozen via <code>FreezingArchRule</code> instead of crashing the test (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/960\">#960</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further Acknowledgement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/hankem\"><code>@​hankem</code></a> for upgrading various dependencies, cleaning up code and extensive reviews</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ArchUnit 1.0.0-rc1</h2>\n<h1>Breaking Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>All deprecated members and classes have been removed (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/909\">#909</a>)</li>\n<li><code>@AnalyzeClasses()</code> without any explicit locations to import will now import the package of the annotated class by default instead of the whole classpath. To restore the old behavior use <code>@AnalyzeClasses(wholeClasspath = true)</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/828\">#828</a>)</li>\n<li>The <code>archunit-junit5-engine-api</code> now resides within the package <code>com.tngtech.archunit.junit.engine_api</code> instead of directly under <code>junit</code>. This only affects users that want to programmatically interface with the <code>ArchUnitTestEngine</code> and should be irrelevant for most users (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/827\">#827</a>)</li>\n<li>ArchUnit now needs at least Java 8 to run (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/833\">#833</a>)</li>\n<li>The ArchUnit types <code>Function</code>, <code>Predicate</code> and <code>Optional</code> have been replaced by the JDK 8 equivalents</li>\n<li><code>DescribedPredicate</code> now extends the JDK 8 <code>Predicate</code>, so <code>apply(..)</code> has to be replaced by <code>test(..)</code></li>\n<li><code>layeredArchitecture()</code> now forces to decide how to deal with dependencies by adding <code>.considering...Dependencies()</code> in the beginning of the declaration. To restore the old behavior declare it as <code>layeredArchitecture().consideringAllDependencies()</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/892\">#892</a>)</li>\n<li><code>ConditionEvents</code> is now an interface and the interface has been cleaned out of all non-essential methods, e.g. <code>getAllowed()</code>. This was done to increase maintainability and make it easier to optimize the internals. If you are missing any functionality now, please file an issue to discuss it (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/876\">#876</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Otherwise, it only targets the classes directly within this package (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/919\">#919</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/968\">#968</a>; thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/grimsa\"><code>@​grimsa</code></a>)\nThe following mapping shows how to translate the old methods to the current methods:\n<ul>\n<li><code>getAllClasses()</code> -&gt; <code>getClassesInPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getAllSubpackages()</code> -&gt; <code>getSubpackagesInTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getClassDependenciesFromSelf()</code> -&gt; <code>getClassDependenciesFromThisPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getClassDependenciesToSelf()</code> -&gt; <code>getClassDependenciesToThisPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getPackageDependenciesFromSelf()</code> -&gt; <code>getPackageDependenciesFromThisPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>getPackageDependenciesToSelf()</code> -&gt; <code>getPackageDependenciesToThisPackageTree()</code></li>\n<li><code>accept(..)</code> -&gt; <code>traversePackageTree(..)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Importing the default package via <code>ClassFileImporter.importPackages(&quot;&quot;)</code> will now yields the same result as using <code>importClasspath()</code> without any <code>ImportOption</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/954\">#954</a>)</li>\n<li><code>ClassFileImporter.importClasspath()</code> now behaves consistently to other import APIs. I.e. no default <code>ImportOptions</code> like <code>DoNotIncludeArchives</code> are added anymore, instead all <code>ImportOptions</code> need to be added the same way as for all other import methods (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/958\">#958</a>)</li>\n<li>The custom collection <code>ImportOptions</code> has been removed from the public API and been replaced by a standard <code>Collection&lt;ImportOption&gt;</code> where appropriate (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/958\">#958</a>)</li>\n<li>The package <code>com.tngtech.archunit.library.plantuml</code> has been moved to <code>com.tngtech.archunit.library.plantuml.rules</code> to make room for adding other PlantUML related features (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/959\">#959</a>)</li>\n<li>SLF4J-API has been upgraded from <code>1.7.36</code> to <code>2.0.3</code>, so any log adapter dependency to be used with ArchUnit (e.g. to hook in Log4J) has to be compatible with SLF4J-API <code>2.x</code> from now on (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/966\">#966</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug where multiple synthetic access calls to methods like <code>access$123(..)</code> would lead to only one access being imported. Note, that these synthetic methods are added for calls to private fields / methods from inner classes to outer classes, etc. (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/957\">#957</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<h2>Lang</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>archunit_ignore_patterns.txt</code> is now also respected by <code>FreezingArchRule</code>. Thus, ignored violations are not added to the <code>ViolationStore</code> anymore (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/915\">#915</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Library</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>testClassesShouldResideInTheSamePackageAsImplementation(..)</code> now supports multiple test classes with same simple name (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/918\">#918</a>; thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/mslowiak\"><code>@​mslowiak</code></a>)</li>\n<li><code>PlantUmlArchCondition</code> now does not throw exceptions anymore, if a class is in none or multiple components, but instead reports those as standard violations. This way these violations can also be frozen via <code>FreezingArchRule</code> instead of crashing the test (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/960\">#960</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further Acknowledgement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/hankem\"><code>@​hankem</code></a> for upgrading various dependencies, cleaning up code and extensive reviews</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ArchUnit 1.0.0-rc1</h2>\n<h1>Breaking Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>All deprecated members and classes have been removed (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/909\">#909</a>)</li>\n<li><code>@AnalyzeClasses()</code> without any explicit locations to import will now import the package of the annotated class by default instead of the whole classpath. To restore the old behavior use <code>@AnalyzeClasses(wholeClasspath = true)</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/828\">#828</a>)</li>\n<li>The <code>archunit-junit5-engine-api</code> now resides within the package <code>com.tngtech.archunit.junit.engine_api</code> instead of directly under <code>junit</code>. This only affects users that want to programmatically interface with the <code>ArchUnitTestEngine</code> and should be irrelevant for most users (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/827\">#827</a>)</li>\n<li>ArchUnit now needs at least Java 8 to run (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/833\">#833</a>)</li>\n<li>The ArchUnit types <code>Function</code>, <code>Predicate</code> and <code>Optional</code> have been replaced by the JDK 8 equivalents</li>\n<li><code>DescribedPredicate</code> now extends the JDK 8 <code>Predicate</code>, so <code>apply(..)</code> has to be replaced by <code>test(..)</code></li>\n<li><code>layeredArchitecture()</code> now forces to decide how to deal with dependencies by adding <code>.considering...Dependencies()</code> in the beginning of the declaration. To restore the old behavior declare it as <code>layeredArchitecture().consideringAllDependencies()</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/892\">#892</a>)</li>\n<li><code>ConditionEvents</code> is now an interface and the interface has been cleaned out of all non-essential methods, e.g. <code>getAllowed()</code>. This was done to increase maintainability and make it easier to optimize the internals. If you are missing any functionality now, please file an issue to discuss it (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/876\">#876</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
