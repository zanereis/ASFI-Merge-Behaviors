What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis fixes SPARK-40280 by normalizing a parquet int/long that has optional metadata with it to look like the expected version that does not have the extra metadata.\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis allows predicate push down in parquet to work when reading files that are complaint with the parquet specification, but different from what Spark writes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added unit tests that cover this use case. I also did some manual testing on some queries to verify that less data is actually read after this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd more info in the v2 table error message to make it more meaningful.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen V2 catalog is not configured, Spark fails to access/create a table using the V2 API and silently falls back to attempting to do the same operation using the V1 Api. This happens frequently among the users. We want to have a better error message so that users can fix the configuration/usage issue by themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to introduce new error class `DATATYPE_MISMATCH` with the following 2 error sub-classes:\r\n- BINARY_OP_DIFF_TYPES\r\n- BINARY_OP_WRONG_TYPE\r\n\r\nand new sub-class of `TypeCheckResult` which represents an error of data type mismatch: `DataTypeMismatch`. The last one will be mapped to the error class `DATATYPE_MISMATCH` with the specified sub-class + message parameters.\r\n\r\nAlso I modified `BinaryOperator` to migrate on new `DataTypeMismatch` in `checkInputDataTypes()`, and regenerated the SQL golden files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration onto error classes makes the errors searchable in docs, and allows to edit error's text messages w/o modifying the source code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'2011-11-11 11:11:11' + '1';\r\ncannot resolve '(TIMESTAMP '2011-11-11 11:11:11' + CAST('1' AS DOUBLE))' due to data type mismatch: differing types in '(TIMESTAMP '2011-11-11 11:11:11' + CAST('1' AS DOUBLE))' (timestamp and double).; line 1 pos 7;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'2011-11-11 11:11:11' + '1';\r\n[DATATYPE_MISMATCH.BINARY_OP_DIFF_TYPES] Cannot resolve \"(TIMESTAMP '2011-11-11 11:11:11' + 1)\" due to data type mismatch: the left and right arguments of the binary operator have different types (\"TIMESTAMP\" and \"DOUBLE\").; line 1 pos 7;\r\n```\r\nThe output contains an error class + sub-class, no duplicate of the SQL expression, quoting by \" of the SQL expression, types in the upper case w/ \".\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ExpressionTypeCheckingSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that, once `PartitionReader.hasNext` returns false once, subsequent calls to `PartitionReader.hasNext` will not call `reader.next()` (which before could cause a timeout).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change prevents potential performance regressions caused by parent nodes that call `PartitionIterator.hasNext` even after it returns false once.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a `batch_infer_udf` function to `pyspark.ml.functions` to help users construct a `pandas_udf` for ML/DL model inference in Spark.  This UDF adds standardized behavior for:\r\n- conversion of the Spark/Pandas DataFrame to numpy arrays.\r\n- batching of the inputs sent to the model predict() function.\r\n- caching of the model and predict() function on the executors.\r\n\r\nAnd the user just needs to provide a predict_batch_fn() function for inference on a batch.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is some sample code for inference using an MNIST model:\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.functions import batch_infer_udf\r\n\r\ndef predict_batch_fn():\r\n    import tensorflow as tf\r\n    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('/path/to/mnist_model')\r\n    def predict(inputs: Union[np.array, Dict[str, np.array]]) -> Union[np.array, Dict[str, np.array]]:\r\n        return model.predict(inputs)\r\n    return predict\r\n\r\nmnist = batch_infer_udf(predict_batch_fn,\r\n                        return_type=ArrayType(FloatType()),\r\n                        batch_size=100,\r\n                        input_tensor_shapes=[[-1, 784]])\r\n\r\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"mnist_data\")\r\npreds = df.withColumn(\"preds\", mnist(struct(df.columns))).toPandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nbackport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37706 for branch-3.3\r\n\r\nSkip optimize the root user-specified repartition in `PropagateEmptyRelation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark should preserve the final repatition which can affect the final output partition which is user-specified.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"select * from values(1) where 1 < rand()\").repartition(1)\r\n\r\n// before:\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nLocalTableScan <empty>, [col1#0]\r\n\r\n//

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the [Contributing and Maintaining Type

type hints.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe no longer use the stub files for type hinting, so we might need to change the documents as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the documentation change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing documentation build should

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPort range specification is supported by specifying the starting port and configuring the number of port retries.Introduction of a new parameters: spark.service.port.custom.origin\r\n\r\nService like SparkUI.port, SparkDriver.port, NettyService.port etc. The starting port number is spark.service.port.custom.origin and the port range is limited by spark.port.maxRetries.  the final port range is: spark.service.port.custom.origin <= port.range <= spark.service.port.custom.origin + spark.port.maxRetries\r\n\r\ne.g. spark.service.port.custom.origin=49152 and spark.port.maxRetries=10,  the actual range of the port is greater than or equal to 49152 and less than 49163\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn a real production environment, there are some special scenarios where we need to limit the scope of the service port.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

request?\r\nWhen calculating driver result size, only counting actual result value while excluding other metadata (e.g., accumUpdates) in the serialized result task object.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nmetadata should not be counted because they will be discarded by the driver immediately after being processed, and will lead to unexpected exception when running jobs with tons of task but actually return small results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to the following new error classes:\r\n- GROUP_BY_POS_OUT_OF_RANGE\r\n- GROUP_BY_POS_REFERS_AGG_EXPR\r\n\r\nand migrate 2 compilation exceptions related to GROUP BY a position onto them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration onto error classes makes the errors searchable in docs, and allows to edit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32298 we were able to merge scalar subquery plans, but DSv2 sources couldn't benefit from that improvement.\r\nThe reason for DSv2 sources were not supported by default is that `SparkOptimizer.earlyScanPushDownRules` build different `Scan`s in logical plans before `MergeScalarSubqueries` is executed. Those `Scan`s can have different pushed-down filters and aggregates and different column pruning defined, which prevents merging the plans.\r\nI would not alter the order of optimization rules as `MergeScalarSubqueries` works better when logical plans are better optimized (a plan is closer to its final logical form, e.g. `InjectRuntimeFilter` already executed). But instead, I would propose a new interface that a `Scan` can implement to indicate if merge is possible with another `Scan` and do the merge if it make sense depending on the `Scan`'s actual parameters.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- adds a new interface `SupportsMerge` that `Scan`s can implement to indicate if 2 `Scan`s can be merged and\r\n- adds implementation of `SupportsMerge` to `ParquetScan` as the first DSv2 source. The merge only happens if pushed-down data and partition filters and pushed-down aggregates match.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nScalar subquery merge can bring considerable performance improvement (see the original https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32298 for the benchmarks) so DSv2 sources should also benefit from that feature.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a draft change of the current state of the Spark Connect prototype implemented as a driver plugin to separate the classpaths and shaded dependent libraries. The benefit of a driver plugin is that the plugin has access to everything inside Spark but can itself be a leaf-build. This allows us to shade it's own minimal set of dependencies without brining new dependencies into Spark.\r\n\r\n#### How is Spark Connect Integrated?\r\n\r\nSpark Connect is implemented as a driver plugin for Apache Spark. This means that it can be optionally loaded by specifying the following option during startup.\r\n\r\n```\r\n--conf spark.plugins=org.apache.spark.sql.sparkconnect.service.SparkConnectPlugin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way that the plugin is integrated into the build system does not require any additional changes and the properly configured Jar files are produced as part of the build.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How are GRPC and Guava dependencies handled?\r\n\r\nSpark Connect relies both on GRPC and Guava. Since the version of Guava is incompatible to the version used in Spark, the plugin shades this dependency directly as part of the build. In the case of Maven this is very easy in the case of SBT it's a bit trickier. For SBT we hook into the `copyDeps` stage of the build and instead of copying the artifact dependency we copy the shaded dependency instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39375\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nExperimental API for Spark Connect\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was added by adding two new test surface areas. On the driver plugin side this patch adds rudimentary test infrastructure that makes sure that Proto plans can be translated into Spark logical plans. Secondly, there are Python integration tests that test the DataFrame to Proto conversion and test the end-to-end execution of Spark Connect queries.\r\n\r\nTo avoid issues with other parts of the build, only tests that require Spark Connect will be started with the driver plugin.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n* The pyspark tests are only support for regular CPython and disabled for pypy\r\n* `mypy` was initially disabled for this patch to reduce friction. Will be enabled again.\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n\r\n* `mypy` is disabled on the Python prototype until follow-up patches fix the warnings.\r\n* The unit-test coverage in Scala is not good. Follow up tests will increases coverage, but to keep this test reasonable I did not add more code.\r\n\r\n### New Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis patch adds GRPC, Protobuf, and an updated Guava to the leaf-build of Spark Connect. These dependencies are not available to the top-level Spark build and are not available to other Spark projects. To avoid dependency issues, the Maven and SBT build will shad GRPC, Protobuf and Guava explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Follow Ups\r\n\r\nDue to the size of the PR, smaller clean-up changes will be submitted as follow up

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `@since` usages in `pyspark.sql.streaming.query`, and `pyspark.sql.window`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNumPy documentation style doesn't play well with our `pyspark.since` (because it just adds `versionadded` directive in the end but NumPy documentation assume to put these in the corresponding section). The output HTML rendering is broken.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, these broken documentations are not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI did not test because the format is fully consistent with others.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-29T11:46:54Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:50:08Z","closed_at":"2022-08-30T02:45:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b359590e67d4b6b58e7b87f051e3732dbd86f48f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR switchs the base image from [`openjdk`](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk) to [`eclipse-temurin`](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin) (original openjdk).\r\n\r\nThe core change is: the OS of base image changes `debian-bullseye` to `ubuntu-focal` (based on debian bullseye).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- According to https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/issues/505 and https://github.com/docker-library/docs/pull/2162, openjdk:8/11 image is EOL and Eclipse Temurin replaces this, the original openjdk image will `remove the 11 and 8 tags (in October 2022, perhaps)` (we are using it in spark), so we have to switch this before it happens. \r\n\r\n- The `openjdk` is [not update anymore](https://adoptopenjdk.net/upstream.html) (the last releases were 8u342 and 11.0.16, Eclipse Temurin replace is recommanded by adoptopenjdk) that means even the 8/11 tag is not removed, we still need to switch `openjdk`.\r\n\r\n- There were [many docker official image](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Adocker-library+temurin&type=code) already switch openjdk to eclipse-temurin.\n\n- According the [jvm ecosystem report](https://snyk.io/jvm-ecosystem-report-2021) from https://github.com/docker-library/docs/pull/2162 , AdoptOpenJDK(now donation to eclipse foundation and rename to eclipse temurin) builds of OpenJDK most popular in production. \r\n\r\n- An ideal long-term solution is that we only choose the jdk version and leave the adaptation of OS to the corresponding openjdk official image (just like eclipse-temurin are suppoort [ubuntu, alpine, centos](https://github.com/adoptium/containers/tree/main/11/jre))\r\n\r\n- The alternate solution is we just swith `openjdk` image to `debian-bullseye` with openjdk 11 installation. like: https://github.com/Yikun/spark/pull/163. But it makes spark image **depends on debian OS more**, that means we will diffcult to support the Java version which debian OS doesn't support (such as openjdk-8-jre is not be supported in current debian anymore).\r\n\r\nFor the above reason, I think `eclipse-temurin` is a good choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the docker images base image changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI passed, I also have a local test on:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExtend Catalyst's type system by a new decimal type: Decimal128Type with Int128.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark SQL today supports the Decimal data type. The implementation of Spark Decimal holds a BigDecimal or Long value. Spark Decimal provides some operators like +, -, *, /, % and so on. These operators rely heavily on the computational power of BigDecimal or Long itself. For ease of understanding, take the + as an example. The implementation shows below.\r\n```\r\n  def + (that: Decimal): Decimal = {\r\n    if (decimalVal.eq(null) && that.decimalVal.eq(null) && scale == that.scale) {\r\n      Decimal(longVal + that.longVal, Math.max(precision, that.precision) + 1, scale)\r\n    } else {\r\n      Decimal(toBigDecimal.bigDecimal.add(that.toBigDecimal.bigDecimal))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWe can see the + of Long will be called if Spark Decimal holds a Long value. Otherwise,  the add of BigDecimal will be called if Spark Decimal holds a BigDecimal value. The other operators of Spark Decimal adopt the similar way. Furthermore, the code shown above calls Decimal.apply to construct a new instance of Spark Decimal.  As we know, the add operator of BigDecimal constructed a new instance of BigDecimal. So, if we call the + operator of Spark Decimal who holds a Long value, Spark will construct a new instance of Decimal. Otherwise, Spark will construct a new instance of BigDecimal and a new instance of Decimal.\r\nThrough rough analysis, we know:\r\n1. The computational power of Spark Decimal may depend on BigDecimal.\r\n2. The calculation operators of Spark Decimal create a lot of new instances of Decimal and may create a lot of new instances of BigDecimal.\r\nIf a large table has a field called 'colA whose type is Spark Decimal, the execution of SUM('colA) will involve the creation of a large number of Spark Decimal instances and BigDecimal instances. These Spark Decimal instances and BigDecimal instances will lead to garbage collection frequently.\r\nInt128 is a high-performance data type about 1X~6X more efficient than BigDecimal for typical operations. It uses a finite (128 bit) precision and can handle up to decimal(38, X). The implementation of Int128 just uses two Long values to represent the high and low bits of 128 bits respectively. Int128 is lighter than BigDecimal, reduces the cost of new() and garbage collection.\r\nIf Spark could support a new type to represent the decimal type with Int128, it would improve the performance for calculation operators.\r\nNow, let's call the new decimal type Decimal128.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, a new decimal type with Int128.

of #37513 and its follow-up #37542.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd code to defensively check if the pre-allocated result array is big enough to handle the next element in a date or timestamp sequence.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`InternalSequenceBase.getSequenceLength` is a fast method for estimating the size of the result array. It uses an estimated step size in micros which is not always entirely accurate for the date/time/time-zone combination. As a result, `getSequenceLength` occasionally overestimates the size of the result array and also occasionally underestimates the size of the result array.\r\n\r\n`getSequenceLength` sometimes overestimates the size of the result array when the step size is in months (because `InternalSequenceBase` assumes 28 days per month). This case is handled: `InternalSequenceBase` will slice the array, if needed.\r\n\r\n`getSequenceLength` sometimes underestimates the size of the result array when the sequence crosses a DST \"spring forward\" without a corresponding \"fall backward\". This case is not handled (thus, this PR).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nselect sequence(\r\n  timestamp'2022-03-13 00:00:00',\r\n  timestamp'2022-03-14 00:00:00',\r\n  interval 1 day) as x;\r\n```\r\nIn the America/Los_Angeles time zone, this results in the following error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 1\r\n\tat scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime$.array_update(ScalaRunTime.scala:77)\r\n```\r\nThis happens because `InternalSequenceBase` calculates an estimated step size of 24 hours. If you add 24 hours to 2022-03-13 00:00:00 in the America/Los_Angeles time zone, you get 2022-03-14 01:00:00 (because 2022-03-13 has only 23 hours due to \"spring forward\"). Since 2022-03-14 01:00:00 is later than the specified stop value, `getSequenceLength` assumes the stop value is not included in the result. Therefore, `getSequenceLength` estimates an array size of 1.\r\n\r\nHowever, when actually creating the sequence, `InternalSequenceBase` does not use a step of 24 hours, but of 1 day. When you add 1 day to 2022-03-13 00:00:00, you get 2022-03-14 00:00:00. Now the stop value *is* included, and we overrun the end of the result array.\r\n\r\nThe new unit test includes examples of problematic date sequences.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds code to to handle the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently on S3 the checkpoint file manager (called `FileContextBasedCheckpointFileManager`) is available which is based on the rename operation. So when a file is opened for an atomic stream a temporary file will be used behind the scenes and when the stream is committed the file is renamed to its final location.\r\n\r\nBut on S3 the rename operation will be a file copy so it has some serious performance implication.\r\n\r\nOn Hadoop 3 there is new interface introduce called [Abortable](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/Abortable.html) and S3AFileSystem has this capability. When the file is small (<= the block size) this will be a single PUT as commit and no operation if it is aborted. When the file is bigger then S3's multipart upload is used: so when the file is committed [a POST is sent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html) and when aborted [a DELETE will be sent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html) (asynchronously).\r\n\r\nThis avoids the file copying altogether.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor improving streaming performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Unit test\r\n\r\nI have refactored the existing `CheckpointFileManagerTests` and run against a test filesystem which supports the `Abortable` interface (see `AbortableFileSystem` which is based on `RawLocalFileSystem`). \r\nThis way we have a unit test.\r\n\r\n#### Integration test\r\n\r\nMoreover the same test can be run against AWS S3 by using an integration test (see `AwsS3AbortableStreamBasedCheckpointFileManagerSuite`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n-> S3_PATH=<..> AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<..> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<..> AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<..>  ./build/mvn install -pl hadoop-cloud  -Phadoop-cloud,hadoop-3,integration-test\r\n\r\nDiscovery starting.\r\nDiscovery completed in 346 milliseconds.\r\nRun starting. Expected test count is: 1\r\nAwsS3AbortableStreamBasedCheckpointFileManagerSuite:\r\n- mkdirs, list, createAtomic, open, delete, exists\r\nCommitterBindingSuite:\r\nAbortableStreamBasedCheckpointFileManagerSuite:\r\nRun completed in 14 seconds, 407 milliseconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 1\r\nSuites: completed 4, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nAll tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Performance test\r\n\r\nI have run a [small performance app](https://github.com/attilapiros/spark-ss-perf/blob/ab4c6004caffc38a218fa81fd5482a6cc07ca14f/src/main/scala/perf.scala) which uses a rate stream and foreach sink with an empty body.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies the synchronization in `Executor.updateDependencies()` in order to allow tasks to be interrupted while they are blocked and waiting on other tasks to finish downloading dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis synchronization was added years ago in https://github.com/mesos/spark/commit/7b9e96c99206c0679d9925e0161fde738a5c7c3a in order to prevent concurrently-launching tasks from performing concurrent dependency updates. If one task is downloading dependencies, all other newly-launched tasks will block until the original dependency download is complete.\r\n\r\nLet's say that a Spark task launches, becomes blocked on a `updateDependencies()` call, then is cancelled while it is blocked. Although Spark will send a `Thread.interrupt()` to the canceled task, the task will continue waiting because threads blocked on a `synchronized` won't throw an InterruptedException in response to the interrupt. As a result, the blocked thread will continue to wait until the other thread exits the synchronized block. \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix this problem by replacing the `synchronized` with a `ReentrantLock`, which has a `lockInterruptibly` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn a real-world scenario, we hit a case where a task was canceled right after being launched while another task was blocked in a slow library download.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to reduce the range of MDC cleanup from all MDC items to only MDC items set by Spark `setLocalProperty`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince [SPARK-8981](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8981), Spark executor adds MDC support. Before setting MDC items, the executor cleans up all MDC items. But it causes an issue for other MDC items not set by Spark but from users at other places. It causes these custom MDC items not shown in executor log.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, previously cleaned MDC items will be shown.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTest

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up PR for #32364. It has been closed by github-actions because it hasn't been updated in a while. The previous PR has added a new custom parameter (spark.sql.catalog.$SESSION_CATALOG_NAME.defaultDatabase) to configure the session catalog's default database which is required by some use cases where the user does not have access to the default database.\r\n\r\nTherefore I have created a new PR based on this and added these changes in addition:\r\n\r\n- Rebased / updated the previous PR to the latest master branch version\r\n- Deleted the DEFAULT_DATABASE  static member from sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/catalog/SessionCatalog.scala and refactored the code regarding this\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf our user does not have any permissions for the Hive default database in Ranger, it will fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n22/08/26 18:36:21 INFO  metastore.RetryingMetaStoreClient: [main]: RetryingMetaStoreClient proxy=class org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.SessionHiveMetaStoreClient ugi=hrt_10@ROOT.HWX.SITE (auth:KERBEROS) retries=1 delay=1 lifetime=0\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: MetaException(message:Permission denied: user [hrt_10] does not have [USE] privilege on [default])\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalog.withClient(HiveExternalCatalog.scala:110)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalog.databaseExists(HiveExternalCatalog.scala:223)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SharedState.externalCatalog$lzycompute(SharedState.scala:150)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SharedState.externalCatalog(SharedState.scala:144)\r\n```\r\nThe idea is that we introduce a new configuration parameter where we can set a different database name for the default database. Our user has enough permissions for this  in Ranger.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```spark-shell --conf spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.defaultDatabase=other_db```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will be a new configuration parameter as I mentioned above but the default value is \"default\" as it was previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1) With github action (all tests passed)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/roczei/spark/actions/runs/2934863118\r\n\r\n2) Manually tested with Ranger + Hive\r\n\r\nScenario a) hrt_10 does not have access to the default database in Hive: \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[hrt_10@quasar-thbnqr-2 ~]$ spark-shell\r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the cardinality of grouping keys grow up over the fallbackCountThreshold, the ObjectHashAggregateExec will dump the hash map whose memory usage is not managed to sort-based. However, at this moment, we will keep the double memory overhead for both hash map and unsafe object, and it may cause OOM.\r\n\r\nUnfortuntly, we encounter this issue. The error msg:\r\n```\r\nObjectAggregationIterator INFO - Aggregation hash map size 128 reaches threshold capacity (128 entries), spilling and falling back to sort based aggregation.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSimilar to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40054, we should refactor the try_add/try_subtract/try_multiply/try_divide functions so that the errors from their children will be shown instead of ignored.\r\n Spark SQL allows arithmetic operations between Number/Date/Timestamp/CalendarInterval/AnsiInterval (see the rule [ResolveBinaryArithmetic](https://github.com/databricks/runtime/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L501) for details). Some of these combinations can throw exceptions too: * Date + CalendarInterval\r\n\r\n- Date + CalendarInterval\r\n- Date + AnsiInterval\r\n- Timestamp + AnsiInterval\r\n- Date - CalendarInterval\r\n- Date - AnsiInterval\r\n- Timestamp - AnsiInterval\r\n- Number * CalendarInterval\r\n- Number * AnsiInterval\r\n- CalendarInterval / Number\r\n- AnsiInterval / Number\r\n\r\nThis Jira is for the cases when both input data types are numbers. I will open jira tickets for DateTime types arithmetic operations if this one got merged.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the semantics of try_add/try_divide/try_subtract/try_multiply. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, after changes, the error from the children of try_add/try_divide/try_subtract/try_multiply functions will be shown instead of ignored.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UT + new

By setting this new configuration to a high value we could effectively mitigate the “run multiple jobs” overhead in take behavior. We could also set it to higher-than-1-but-still-small values (like, say, 10) to achieve a middle-ground trade-off.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `castPartValueToDesiredType` function now returns byte for ByteType and short for ShortType, rather than ints; also floats for FloatType rather than double.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously, attempting to read back in a file partitioned on one of these column types would result in a ClassCastException at runtime (for Byte, `java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Byte`). I can't think this is anything but a bug, as returning the correct data type prevents the crash.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes: it changes the observed behavior when reading in a byte/short/float-partitioned file.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test. Without the `castPartValueToDesiredType` updates, the test fails with the stated exception.\r\n\r\n===\r\nI'll note that I'm not familiar enough with the spark repo to know if this will have ripple effects elsewhere, but tests pass on my fork and since the very similar https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36344/files only needed to touch these two files I expect this change is self-contained as

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn `CatalogImpl`, we need to look up the view again to get the schema, as `ResolvedView` only contains the view identifier. This PR fix this issue by refactoring the `ResolvedView`:\r\n1. Split it into `ResolvedPersistentView` and `ResolvedTempView`\r\n2. The new logical plans hold the view schema\r\n3. `ResolvedPersistentView` holds the catalog, to match `ResolvedTable`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up the temp view related methods in `SessionCatalog`:\r\n1. group them together in the section `Methods that interact with temp views only`\r\n2. rename 2 methods to make the naming more consistent.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup and avoid redundant view lookup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

GROUPING SETS ...`, it should still work if it worked before.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32022 made a mistake that it didn't preserve the order of user-specified group by columns. Usually it's not a problem, as `GROUP BY a, b` is no different from `GROUP BY b, a`. However, the `grouping_id(...)` function requires the input to be exactly the same with the group by columns. This PR fixes the problem by preserve the order of user-specified group by columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for [SPARK-39731](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39731) and PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37147.\r\n\r\nI found that it could be problematic to change `spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy` to LEGACY when inferring dates and timestamps in CSV and JSON. Sometimes it is beneficial to have the time parser policy as CORRECTED but still use a more lenient date and timestamp inference (or when migrating to a newer Spark version).\r\n\r\nI added two separate configs that control this behavior:\r\n- `spark.sql.legacy.csv.enableDateTimeParsingFallback`\r\n- `spark.sql.legacy.json.enableDateTimeParsingFallback`\r\n\r\nWhen the configs are set to `true`, the legacy time parsing behaviour is enabled (pre Spark 3.0).\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the precedence order is as follows for CSV (similar for JSON):\r\n- data source option `enableDateTimeParsingFallback`\r\n- if that is not set, check `spark.sql.legacy.{csv,json}.enableDateTimeParsingFallback`\r\n- if that is not set, check `spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy` and whether or not a custom format is used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe change makes it easier for users to migrate to a newer Spark version without changing global config `spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy`. Also, allows to enable legacy parsing for CSV and JSON separately without changing the code or the global time parser config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, simply adds an ability to change the behaviour specifically for CSV or JSON.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test for CSV and JSON to verify the flag.","created_at":"2022-08-25T05:56:10Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T07:39:09Z","closed_at":"2022-08-26T07:23:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39a2f0c10866d75b5ebc1ee614945b3c131d2dde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/48f320489b9ea925a4cc2e8ec280d7181591c799","head":{"label":"sadikovi:SPARK-40215","ref":"SPARK-40215","sha":"48f320489b9ea925a4cc2e8ec280d7181591c799","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to support ASCII value conversion for Latin-1 Supplement characters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`ascii()` should be the inverse of `chr()`. But for latin-1 char, we get incorrect ascii value. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nselect ascii('§') -- output: -62, expect: 167\r\nselect chr(167) -- output: '§'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes the incorrect ASCII conversion for Latin-1 Supplement characters\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-25T01:13:21Z","updated_at":"2022-08-31T17:28:52Z","closed_at":"2022-08-25T04:18:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a58fc46f2def3ed28913a9163d2175c49bd95bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/529ccd72895255e3d4cca8b3f27a0fb8d36ddc97","head":{"label":"linhongliu-db:SPARK-40213","ref":"SPARK-40213","sha":"529ccd72895255e3d4cca8b3f27a0fb8d36ddc97","user":{"login":"linhongliu-db","id":67896261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODk2MjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67896261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":289223205,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODkyMjMyMDU=","name":"spark","full_name":"linhongliu-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linhongliu-db","id":67896261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODk2MjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67896261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db/spark","description":"Apache
