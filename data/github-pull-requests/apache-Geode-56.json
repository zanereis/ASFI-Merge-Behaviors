PR has two commits.  The first reverts the previous attempt to fix GEODE-5505.  Those changes only addressed destroy() operations but the problem could occur with any operation.\r\n\r\nThe second commit implements a delay in region synchronization operations to allow clients to retry their operations.  Region synchronization occurs when another server hosting the same region crashes.  It uses a RegionVersionVector to comb through other servers to find partially distributed operations and send the associated entries.\r\n\r\nWithout the delay it is possible for the sync to complete before a client retries its operation, so that the client's replay encounters the state change it already made in its previous attempt.\r\n\r\nWith this change a client's replay will either be on a server that didn't see the previous attempt, or it will be on a server that did see the previous attempt & has the operation recorded in its EventTracker.  In the first case the operation will be performed again and transmitted to other servers.  In the second case the server will not apply the operation to its cache but will forward it to other servers.\r\n\r\nThe delay is based on the server's \"maximum time between pings interval\", which defaults to 1 minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible. If you need help, please send an\r\nemail to

is an AtomicBoolean (memoryThresholdReached) in LocalRegion.\r\nIn DistributedRegion, a subclass of LocalRegion, there is a CopyOnWriteArraySet (memoryThresholdReachedMembers).\r\n\r\nIn DistributedRegion, these two fields are set together by synchronizing on memoryThresholdReachedMembers.\r\nIf the boolean is true (meaning we crossed the critical threshold), the set must contain the members\r\nthat are low on memory.\r\n\r\nIn LocalRegion, these two fields were being read without synchronization, so the boolean and set could be\r\ninconsistent with each other. The boolean could be read as true, but the set could be read as empty.\r\nThis can occur when the reading thread reads the boolean, then another thread calls a method that sets\r\nboth fields, then the reading thread reads the set.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds a new method to DistributedRegion (getAtomicThresholdInfo) that reads the two fields with synchronization.

I'd like many reviews on this complete rewrite of our documentation on transactions.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, I moved and renamed the existing, lengthy and detailed section on transactions into the manual section called Reference.  The new section on transactions is short and omits lots of nit-picky details on implementation and hacks a Geode user might take advantage of  (if they were super-knowledgeable and wanted to push the limits of what a transaction might accomplish).  Instead, this rewritten section attempts to provide directed examples upon which a Geode developer might model their own transactional code implementation.\r\n\r\nIn my attempts to be as concise as possible, I have left out details of features.  Reviewers: what have I left out that you deem important to say about transactions?  For example, I left out all mention of suspend() and resume().  Are they parts of the API that we should be presenting?\r\n\r\nReviewers: please also look over the code fragments with a detailed eye.
