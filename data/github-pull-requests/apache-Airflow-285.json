title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1914\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe built-in email utils does not support\r\nmultibyte string content, for example,\r\nJapanese or emojis. The fix is to add\r\nmime_charset parameter to allow for other\r\nvalues such as `utf-8`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded test_send_smtp_with_multibyte_content in tests/core.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the JIRA issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2411.  It allows jar files to be specified via templates, so that we can programmatically decide which jars to use.  I ran this proposed change by @fenglu-g and he agreed it was worthwhile.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is a very minor change, adding only one field (`dataproc_jars`) to the list of templated fields for the various DataProc operators that submit jobs requiring jar files.  Note that this field is always called `dataproc_jars` in the operators, even though each operator's constructor has a different name for this field.  So the change may look a slight bit confusing, because it might appear that the templated field should vary by operator, but this is not the case.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR does not add tests because this is such a small change, and there are no tests currently in-place to test the templated fields.  However we have been running Airflow at Etsy with a subset of these changes (only the change for the `DataProcHadoopOperator`) successfully for about a month.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] No documentation added because none exists which specifies the templated field list for dataproc operators.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-02T23:30:38Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T21:19:41Z","closed_at":"2018-05-03T20:56:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"faf4a4e95f9f6c34a08912110b5c532c92b2da06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/200fc1b214a4ce769a52e68b3bc65b168e2dc542","head":{"label":"mchalek:template-dataproc-jars","ref":"template-dataproc-jars","sha":"200fc1b214a4ce769a52e68b3bc65b168e2dc542","user":{"login":"mchalek","id":3099936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTk5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3099936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek","html_url":"https://github.com/mchalek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103997822,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM5OTc4MjI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mchalek/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mchalek","id":3099936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTk5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3099936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek","html_url":"https://github.com/mchalek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mchalek/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2213\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis extends CheckOperator and ValueCheckOperator for Qubole Commands.\r\nIt also adds another optional parameter called `results_parser_callable` which \r\nis a python_callable that should hold the logic to parse a list of rows returned by \r\nthe Qubole command and return a list of records on which the checks have to be \r\nperformed. By default, only the first row is parsed. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Adds qubole_check_operator tests to check \r\n       - if the operator passes if the query result is within a permissible range of values. \r\n       - if the operator fails if the query results is not with a permissible limit. \r\n       - if pass_value gets templatized properly.\r\n       - if the operator fails, it contains Qubole command related information in the exception \r\n          message.\r\n- Adds `qubole_check_hook` tests to test the default parse_first_row method in case of different query results.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n* See above.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt fixes tests flake8 that currently fail.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | __python3 -m__ flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-48\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - This PR makes it so that the uri query string is parsed as dictionary, turned to json and placed in the `extra` property allowing for example to set the `sslmode` on a Postgres connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Added unit tests for parsing the connection from a uri.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2086\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSimilar to what airflow-2393, airflow-2086 describes, airflow tree view is very slow to run which often triggers guicorn timeout if the dag has many tasks and dependencies. We limit the default tree view to most recent 5 dagruns which help to alleviate the issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-29T22:36:09Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T15:48:07Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T15:48:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b999b1588633d478bd48e40368f28b92b86fe51d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/03e241cd75cdc7eb227705756b7e4e3aef192f63","head":{"label":"feng-tao:reduce-tree-view","ref":"reduce-tree-view","sha":"03e241cd75cdc7eb227705756b7e4e3aef192f63","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122814628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjI4MTQ2Mjg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feng-tao/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao/airflow","description":"Apache

this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-27T15:35:38Z","updated_at":"2018-04-29T09:55:56Z","closed_at":"2018-04-29T09:55:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd2aa1916b20359336116726b24aa70e36f8df66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3271/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3271/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3271/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4f9694e1ab0182e3eb735753242345d78a17a930","head":{"label":"ese:secrets-kubernetes-operator","ref":"secrets-kubernetes-operator","sha":"4f9694e1ab0182e3eb735753242345d78a17a930","user":{"login":"ese","id":755174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/755174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese","html_url":"https://github.com/ese","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":131314531,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzEzMTQ1MzE=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"ese/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ese","id":755174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/755174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese","html_url":"https://github.com/ese","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ese/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ese/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2370\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdd a flag to 'airflow create_user' that will generate a random password rather than prompting.  Passwords seem unnecessary when AUTH_OAUTH is enabled.  (Random password works for my workflow, at least!  Perhaps (likely) there's a better solution.)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  Added a simple test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-24T17:29:30Z","updated_at":"2018-04-29T03:16:30Z","closed_at":"2018-04-28T19:00:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32556d3fb2553906a47133c8b3a4d337bcfdafa9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/53af034b0a339520fd8c6865a600ddc97c821285","head":{"label":"wrp:passwords","ref":"passwords","sha":"53af034b0a339520fd8c6865a600ddc97c821285","user":{"login":"wrp","id":41831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp","html_url":"https://github.com/wrp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e44688ed090a438a20751e11cc96c72554630f1d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n   - This PR fixes a regression introduced by https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3257\r\n   - It checks the autocommit parameter and defaults to False if not present. This leads to the correct behavior for SQLite\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - Not needed here, just fixing a test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2359) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2359\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdding set failed for DagRun and TaskInstance in tree view. Setting DagRun state to failed will mark all running task instances to failed and thus kill the task instance in the next heartbeat. Setting DagRun state to success will mark all task instances to success. Above logics are also added to DagRunModelView, so that the bahavior of setting DagRun state will be consistent over the platform.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the screenshot of the new UI:\r\nIn tree view:\r\n![screen shot 2018-04-30 at 12 22 49 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/39445909-72b277e8-4c71-11e8-88a7-663d3ade9471.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-04-30 at 12 22 58 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/39445913-7490e93c-4c71-11e8-90e8-a89407d8311e.png)\r\n\r\nSet DagRun status in DagRunModelView:\r\n![screen shot 2018-04-30 at 12 23 34 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/39445923-7ff43a7c-4c71-11e8-99ca-ce819b3c553d.png)\r\nafter the operation:\r\n![screen shot 2018-04-30 at 12 23 51 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/39445928-86a295bc-4c71-11e8-8c9f-303b18aaeadb.png)\r\n\r\nEdit DagRun status in model edit view:\r\nAfter operation:\r\n![screen shot 2018-04-30 at 12 24 17 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/39445945-9d0440e4-4c71-11e8-9a4c-5b9f33ff5f31.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/api/common/experimental/mark_tasks.py:TestMarkDAGRun\r\ntests/www_rbac/test_views.py: TestAirflowBaseViews:test_failed\r\n\r\nManual tested in both legacy UI and RBAC UI.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

logs are kept inside of the worker pod. By attaching a persistent disk we keep the logs and make them available for the webserver.\r\n\r\nRight now, when a pod exits, the log is lost forever because it is still in the container. By mounting a persistent volume we can easily fix this and this allows us to have logs on our local machines (minikube). In production you might want to write your logs to GCS/S3/etc.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2357\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-2357\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-74\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe should change the default executor for subdag_operator to SequentialExecutor. Airflow pool is not hornored by subdagoperator, hence it could consume all the worker resources(e.g in celeryExecutor). This causes issues mentioned in airflow-74 and limits the subdag_operator usage. We use subdag_operator in production by specifying using sequential executor. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added. \r\n I put a note on the behavior change for subdag_operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

and plugin executors\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2354\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen running a single task instance from the UI there is a check that limits the functionality to the CeleryExecutor.\r\n\r\nThis seems outdated since the addition of the DaskExecutor which presumably supports this operation.\r\n\r\nAlso other airflow users (such as myself) may be using plugin executors that support running tasks this way.\r\n\r\nChanged the check to block the operation when using either the LocalExecutor or SequentialExecutor, rather than permitting only for the CeleryExecutor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded www.test_views.TestRunTaskInstanceView which includes two test cases for this\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nNot needed\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\nYup","created_at":"2018-04-20T22:48:01Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T04:22:41Z","closed_at":"2018-12-18T04:22:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea5a1e1340305a4a17ed1b0109f402b381e6a8d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2350\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nDocumentation fixes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Documentation fixes, so not tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2344\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    `airflow connections -l` uses 'tabulate' package with\r\n    fancy_grid format, which outputs box drawing characters.\r\n    It can occur UnicodeEncodeError with pipe or redirect,\r\n    since the default encoding for Python 2.x is ascii.\r\n    This PR fixes it and contains some flask8 related fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded tests.core:CliTests.test_cli_connections_list_redirect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-20T06:25:22Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T09:13:55Z","closed_at":"2018-04-23T09:13:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d67cb42015d21f2de10a18929d4488ee3a95670","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3244/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3244/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3244/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/005a0457879027840552fe7cfce39555d2e92be8","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-2344","ref":"AIRFLOW-2344","sha":"005a0457879027840552fe7cfce39555d2e92be8","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

compatible with Python 3 by using the `hmsclient` package instead of `hive-thrift-py`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIt replaces existing functionality, so existing tests should cover it.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-18T09:32:51Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T10:24:53Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T10:24:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a76c54793524e9cefa5b21b1bde0398289b13dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c8df960abc8a099cf7358211f5993bce302a2196","head":{"label":"gglanzani:AIRFLOW-2336","ref":"AIRFLOW-2336","sha":"c8df960abc8a099cf7358211f5993bce302a2196","user":{"login":"gglanzani","id":630284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDI4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani","html_url":"https://github.com/gglanzani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89476138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTQ3NjEzOA==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"gglanzani/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gglanzani","id":630284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDI4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani","html_url":"https://github.com/gglanzani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gglanzani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gglanzani/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2335\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is an issue with travis pulling jdk8 that is preventing CI jobs from running. This blocks further development of the project.\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9512#issuecomment-382235301\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR can't be unit tested since it is just configuration. However, the fact that unit tests run successfully should show that it works.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-18T03:51:37Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T16:41:46Z","closed_at":"2018-04-18T05:00:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67fa1aa5fc20352a2d4c02419ba23f55844348b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/cfc4243ce2a3098164169a525b11948720d2c93d","head":{"label":"bloomberg:AIRFLOW-2335_travis_issue","ref":"AIRFLOW-2335_travis_issue","sha":"cfc4243ce2a3098164169a525b11948720d2c93d","user":{"login":"bloomberg","id":1416818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0MTY4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1416818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg","html_url":"https://github.com/bloomberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloomberg/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3f1bfd38cd5a1c9c58045004390a6a766bec5e8d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

[AIRFLOW-2330](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2330).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe change introduces a check whether the `destination_object` parameter was given when using a wildcard (`*`) in the `source_object` parameter.

[AIRFLOW-2326](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2326) \"Duplicate GCS copy operator\".\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis patch removes one of the two operators with the same functionality. Out of the two, I have removed the `gcs_copy_operator` for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The other one, `gcs_to_gcs.GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageOperator` follows the naming structure of other operators that move data (e.g. `gcs_to_bq.GoogleCloudStorageToBigQueryOperator`).\r\n2. `GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageOperator` has a bit more functionality, allowing for moving files (i.e. deleting the originals). This pattern can be used for extending the moving functionality to e.g. `rewrite`, as I propose in

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2299\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, S3FileTransformOperator downloads the whole file from S3\r\nbefore transforming and uploading it. Adding extraction feature using\r\nS3 Select to this operator improves its efficiency and usablitily.\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades boto3 to 1.7.0+, since [it supports S3 Select from that version](https://github.com/boto/boto3/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.rst#170).\r\nI checked [boto3's Upgrading Notes](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/upgrading.html) and confirmed that changes referred there doesn't affect Airflow.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- Added:\r\n\r\n  - tests.hooks.test_s3_hook:TestS3Hook.test_select_key\r\n  - tests.operators.test_s3_file_transform_operator:TestS3FileTransformOperator.test_execute_with_select_expression\r\n\r\n- Updated and renamed:\r\n\r\n  - tests.operators.test_s3_file_transform_operator:TestS3FileTransformOperator.test_execute_with_transform_script\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8
