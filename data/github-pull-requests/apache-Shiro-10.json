to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.3.1 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the version of <code>jackson-core</code> dependency to 2.15.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24727\">#24727</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where submitting a job was failing when it is done using Hazelcast Command-Line Client (CLC). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24704\">#24704</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the REST calls were failing for Hazelcast clusters with TLS v1.3 configured, and deployed on Kubernetes. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24623\">#24623</a></li>\n<li>Fixed various issues in Health Monitor including incorrect metric names. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24636\">#24636</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v5.3.0</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.3.0 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connector for Kafka Connect source (BETA)</strong>: Import data from an external system directly into a Hazelcast data pipeline without the need of a Kafka cluster.</li>\n<li><strong>Connector for MongoDB (BETA)</strong>: Read and write from/to MongoDB via this connector and execute SQL queries on Mongo collections directly from Hazelcast.</li>\n<li><strong>Partition-Aware SQL Client</strong>: Send the SQL commands only to the members having the relevant data, which reduces the network hops and improves the query performances.</li>\n<li><strong>Data connection support in SQL</strong>: data connections and mappings using them can be managed using SQL commands.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Renamed the <code>DataLinkFactory</code> interface as <code>DataConnection</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24224\">#24224</a></li>\n<li>Removed the <code>TO_ROW</code> function as it is obsolete, you can use <code>CAST (udtObj AS JSON)</code> instead. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23808\">#23808</a></li>\n<li>SQL mappings for internal maps (<code>__sql.catalog</code> and <code>__jet.*</code>) cannot be created anymore. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24282\">#24282</a></li>\n<li>Changed the default cloud coordinator URL from <code>coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> to <code>api.viridian.hazelcast.com</code>.\nThe default configuration now connects to <a href=\"https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/\">https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/</a> instead of Hazelcast Cloud.\nIf you want to continue accessing your Hazelcast Cloud clusters, you need to set the <code>hazelcast.client.cloud.url</code> property to <code>https://coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> in your configuration. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23290\">#23290</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Cloud</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hazelcast was sending requests to Kubernetes API when deploying an application with embedded Hazelcast and <code>service-dns</code> (DNS lookup mode) specified to a Kubernetes cluster.\nThis was causing the requests to be unsuccessful and the application not to start. This mechanism has been improved by creating Kubernetes client only for the DNS lookup mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23883\">#23883</a></li>\n<li>When advanced networking is enabled, the Kubernetes discovery plugin might have been discovering several endpoints (per each port)\nfor each member's pod. The discovery plugin now matches only the private IP per endpoint, ignoring the port values. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23766\">#23766</a></li>\n<li>Added support of link:<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-machine-images-support-instance-metadata-service-version-2-default/#:~:text=Posted%20On%3A%20Oct%203%2C%202022,depth%20against%20unauthorized%20metadata%20access.%5BIMDSv2%5E%5D\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-machine-images-support-instance-metadata-service-version-2-default/#:~:text=Posted%20On%3A%20Oct%203%2C%202022,depth%20against%20unauthorized%20metadata%20access.[IMDSv2^]</a> for Hazelcast's AWS Discovery plugin. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23545\">#23545</a></li>\n<li>Added the support of discovering ECS and EC2 members on AWS. See xref:deploy:deploying-on-aws.adoc[Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS]. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22411\">#22411</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support of generating suggested Data Definition Language (DDL) for a map with High-Density Memory Store and having no indexes. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24054\">#24054</a></li>\n<li>Disk tier option of Tiered Storage is now disabled by default. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23747\">#23747</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTE: Tiered Storage feature is still in BETA stage.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

`jetty.version` from 9.4.51.v20230217 to 11.0.0.\nUpdates `jetty-maven-plugin` from 9.4.51.v20230217 to 11.0.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases\">jetty-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>11.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Eclipse Jetty 11.x Highlights</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Jetty 11.x has a minimum Java requirement of Java 11.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x modules are proper JPMS modules with <code>module-info.class</code>.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x supports the following technology specs (from the Jakarta EE 9 effort):\n<ul>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet</code> - 5.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp</code> - 3.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.el</code> - 4.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.websocket</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x is the first major version of Jetty to support the <code>jakarta.servlet</code> namespace.<br />\nUse Jetty 10.x for the older (now outdated) <code>javax.servlet</code> namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Important Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic jetty logging facade has been replaced with slf4j-api usage</li>\n<li>There is no longer a <code>jetty-distribution</code>, use <code>jetty-home</code> with a proper <code>${jetty.base}</code> instead.<br />\nSee: <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/10.0.0/operations-guide/index.html#og-begin-arch\">Operations Guide: Architecture</a>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>demo</code> jetty-start module exists to replace the old demo-base functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove jetty-all uber artifact</li>\n<li>Managing <code>Configuration</code> within a <code>WebAppContext</code> has a new API.<br />\n(They are now self ordering and do not require knowledge of Jetty internals to use successfully)</li>\n<li>Complete WebSocket refactoring, those using the Jetty APIs or embedded-jetty will need to update their code.\n<ul>\n<li>Support for WebSocket over HTTP/2 (client and server)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty HttpClient has been improved.\n<ul>\n<li>Supports dynamic protocol upgrade (http/2 and http/1.1).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Session management has been refactored as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a

href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases\">jetty-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>11.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Eclipse Jetty 11.x Highlights</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Jetty 11.x has a minimum Java requirement of Java 11.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x modules are proper JPMS modules with <code>module-info.class</code>.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x supports the following technology specs (from the Jakarta EE 9 effort):\n<ul>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet</code> - 5.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp</code> - 3.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.el</code> - 4.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.websocket</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x is the first major version of Jetty to support the <code>jakarta.servlet</code> namespace.<br />\nUse Jetty 10.x for the older (now outdated) <code>javax.servlet</code> namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Important Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic jetty logging facade has been replaced with slf4j-api usage</li>\n<li>There is no longer a <code>jetty-distribution</code>, use <code>jetty-home</code> with a proper <code>${jetty.base}</code> instead.<br />\nSee: <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/10.0.0/operations-guide/index.html#og-begin-arch\">Operations Guide: Architecture</a>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>demo</code> jetty-start module exists to replace the old demo-base functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove jetty-all uber artifact</li>\n<li>Managing <code>Configuration</code> within a <code>WebAppContext</code> has a new

href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html\">Gradle Module Metadata</a></h4>\n<p>The Gradle team has contributed a metadata file for Guava. If you use Gradle 6 or higher, you will see better handling of two kinds of dependency conflicts, plus another small feature related to our dependencies:</p>\n<h5>Selecting the appropriate flavor</h5>\n<p>When Gradle automatically selects the newest version of Guava in your dependency graph, it will now also select the appropriate flavor (<code>-android</code> or <code>-jre</code>) based on whether you project targets Android or not. For example, if you depend on 32.1.0-android and 30.0-jre, Gradle will select 32.1.0-jre. This is the version most likely to be compatible with all your dependencies.</p>\n<p>In the unusual event that you need to override Gradle's choice of flavor, you can do so as follows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"kotlin\"><code>dependencies.constraints {\n  implementation(&quot;com.google.guava:guava&quot;) {\n    attributes {\n      attribute(\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

#896 \r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n*NOTE*: If using Java modules with the previous alphas, the module names have changed (example: `shiro.core -> org.apache.shiro.core)`\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

a stale-action so old issues and PRs get a stale label after 90 days and get closed after further 7 days when no-one commented.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In

#947 \r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

#943\r\n\r\nlogback was probably added for tests or out of ignorance of the existing log4j dependency.\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

#942 (flaky test).\r\n\r\nIdea: Sometimes two same IDs are being generated. This can easily be fixed by using a while loop instead of a for loop.\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

`jetty.version` from 9.4.51.v20230217 to 11.0.0.\nUpdates `jetty-maven-plugin` from 9.4.51.v20230217 to 11.0.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases\">jetty-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>11.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Eclipse Jetty 11.x Highlights</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Jetty 11.x has a minimum Java requirement of Java 11.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x modules are proper JPMS modules with <code>module-info.class</code>.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x supports the following technology specs (from the Jakarta EE 9 effort):\n<ul>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet</code> - 5.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp</code> - 3.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.el</code> - 4.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.websocket</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x is the first major version of Jetty to support the <code>jakarta.servlet</code> namespace.<br />\nUse Jetty 10.x for the older (now outdated) <code>javax.servlet</code> namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Important Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic jetty logging facade has been replaced with slf4j-api usage</li>\n<li>There is no longer a <code>jetty-distribution</code>, use <code>jetty-home</code> with a proper <code>${jetty.base}</code> instead.<br />\nSee: <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/10.0.0/operations-guide/index.html#og-begin-arch\">Operations Guide: Architecture</a>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>demo</code> jetty-start module exists to replace the old demo-base functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove jetty-all uber artifact</li>\n<li>Managing <code>Configuration</code> within a <code>WebAppContext</code> has a new API.<br />\n(They are now self ordering and do not require knowledge of Jetty internals to use successfully)</li>\n<li>Complete WebSocket refactoring, those using the Jetty APIs or embedded-jetty will need to update their code.\n<ul>\n<li>Support for WebSocket over HTTP/2 (client and server)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty HttpClient has been improved.\n<ul>\n<li>Supports dynamic protocol upgrade (http/2 and http/1.1).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Session management has been refactored as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a

removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.3.1 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the version of <code>jackson-core</code> dependency to 2.15.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24727\">#24727</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where submitting a job was failing when it is done using Hazelcast Command-Line Client (CLC). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24704\">#24704</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the REST calls were failing for Hazelcast clusters with TLS v1.3 configured, and deployed on Kubernetes. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24623\">#24623</a></li>\n<li>Fixed various issues in Health Monitor including incorrect metric names. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24636\">#24636</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v5.3.0</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.3.0 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connector for Kafka Connect source (BETA)</strong>: Import data from an external system directly into a Hazelcast data pipeline without the need of a Kafka cluster.</li>\n<li><strong>Connector for MongoDB (BETA)</strong>: Read and write from/to MongoDB via this connector and execute SQL queries on Mongo collections directly from Hazelcast.</li>\n<li><strong>Partition-Aware SQL Client</strong>: Send the SQL commands only to the members having the relevant data, which reduces the network hops and improves the query performances.</li>\n<li><strong>Data connection support in SQL</strong>: data connections and mappings using them can be managed using SQL commands.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Renamed the <code>DataLinkFactory</code> interface as <code>DataConnection</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24224\">#24224</a></li>\n<li>Removed the <code>TO_ROW</code> function as it is obsolete, you can use <code>CAST (udtObj AS JSON)</code> instead. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23808\">#23808</a></li>\n<li>SQL mappings for internal maps (<code>__sql.catalog</code> and <code>__jet.*</code>) cannot be created anymore. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24282\">#24282</a></li>\n<li>Changed the default cloud coordinator URL from <code>coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> to <code>api.viridian.hazelcast.com</code>.\nThe default configuration now connects to <a href=\"https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/\">https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/</a> instead of Hazelcast Cloud.\nIf you want to continue accessing your Hazelcast Cloud clusters, you need to set the <code>hazelcast.client.cloud.url</code> property to <code>https://coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> in your configuration. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23290\">#23290</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Cloud</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hazelcast was sending requests to Kubernetes API when deploying an application with embedded Hazelcast and <code>service-dns</code> (DNS lookup mode) specified to a Kubernetes cluster.\nThis was causing the requests to be unsuccessful and the application not to start. This mechanism has been improved by creating Kubernetes client only for the DNS lookup mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23883\">#23883</a></li>\n<li>When advanced networking is enabled, the Kubernetes discovery plugin might have been discovering several endpoints (per each port)\nfor each member's pod. The discovery plugin now matches only the private IP per endpoint, ignoring the port values. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23766\">#23766</a></li>\n<li>Added support of link:<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-machine-images-support-instance-metadata-service-version-2-default/#:~:text=Posted%20On%3A%20Oct%203%2C%202022,depth%20against%20unauthorized%20metadata%20access.%5BIMDSv2%5E%5D\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-machine-images-support-instance-metadata-service-version-2-default/#:~:text=Posted%20On%3A%20Oct%203%2C%202022,depth%20against%20unauthorized%20metadata%20access.[IMDSv2^]</a> for Hazelcast's AWS Discovery plugin. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23545\">#23545</a></li>\n<li>Added the support of discovering ECS and EC2 members on AWS. See xref:deploy:deploying-on-aws.adoc[Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS]. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22411\">#22411</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support of generating suggested Data Definition Language (DDL) for a map with High-Density Memory Store and having no indexes. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24054\">#24054</a></li>\n<li>Disk tier option of Tiered Storage is now disabled by default. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23747\">#23747</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTE: Tiered Storage feature is still in BETA stage.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1676\">#1676</a></li>\n<li>We are improving the way that <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">CodeQL bundles</a> are tagged to make it possible to easily identify bundles by their CodeQL semantic version. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1682\">#1682</a>\n<ul>\n<li>As of CodeQL CLI 2.13.4, CodeQL bundles will be tagged using semantic versions, for example <code>codeql-bundle-v2.13.4</code>, instead of timestamps, like <code>codeql-bundle-20230615</code>.</li>\n<li>This change does not affect the majority of workflows, and we will not be changing tags for existing bundle releases.</li>\n<li>Some workflows with custom logic that depends on the specific format of the CodeQL bundle tag may need to be updated. For example, if your workflow matches CodeQL bundle tag names against a <code>codeql-bundle-yyyymmdd</code> pattern, you should update it to also recognize <code>codeql-bundle-vx.y.z</code> tags.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the requirement for <code>on.push</code> and <code>on.pull_request</code> to trigger on the same branches. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1675\">#1675</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.3 - 04 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1664\">#1664</a></li>\n<li>You can now configure CodeQL within your code scanning workflow by passing a <code>config</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action. See <a href=\"https://aka.ms/code-scanning-docs/config-file\">Using a custom configuration file</a> for more information about configuring code scanning. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1590\">#1590</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.2 - 27 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.1 - 26 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.0 - 21 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1649\">#1649</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.8.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1618\">#1618</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.12 - 13 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the value of the <code>GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT</code> environment variable in the telemetry sent to GitHub. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically\">default setup</a>. The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
