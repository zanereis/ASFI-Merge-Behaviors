Distinguish those markers at the TRACE and DEBUG levels (now Markers named *_VERBOSE) from those that log at a coarser granularity (now Markers named *_MARKER) to prevent accidental misuse.\r\n* Suppress only *_VERBOSE markers by default, from previous behavior of suppressing all markers.\r\n* Refactor some pathological log checks, e.g., change a log from debug to trace when it is gated behind ifTraceEnabled block.\r\n* Remove unused Markers.\r\n* Remove any log marker logic from AdminWaiters exception message generation.  Exceptions now always include a full message.\r\n* Remove marker-gated print to System.out in PersistentOplogSet -- direct calls to System.out should not exist in that class.\r\n* Add marker EVENT_ID_TO_STRING_VERBOSE to explicitly distinguish instance of marker used in logic not immediately consumed by a logger.  The consumption of EventId::toString should only exist at logging in any event.\r\n\r\n* Remove nearby dead code and dead code detected during marker removal.\r\n* Expand wildcard imports in touched files.\r\n* Remove TODO comments, at least one of which was a decade old.\r\n* Collapse nearby, redundant catch blocks\r\n* Remove empty finally blocks\r\n* Update documentation page to refer to GEODE_VERBOSE, from deprecated GEMFIRE_VERBOSE\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

change is to start locator members with LOCATOR_DM_TYPE using the InternalLocator.FORCE_LOCATOR_DM_TYPE system property. This is the same property that InternalLocator startLocator uses. This affects several DUnit tests.\r\n\r\nI did some refactoring as part of this change.\r\n\r\nAsyncEventQueueTestBase - changed to use system property\r\nUpdateVersionDUnitTest - changed to use system property and  also a bunch of refactoring to reduce duplicate code\r\nCacheClientNotifierDUnitTest - changed to make the locator member just a locator and not create regions
