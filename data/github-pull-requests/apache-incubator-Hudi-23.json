Clean files at task side if it fails\r\n\r\nWhen `Executor` tries to kill a task, spark will set the `TaskContext` as interrupted and interrupt the task thread.\r\n\r\nSpark internally holds an `InterruptibleIterator` to monitor task status and kill task if it's interrupted, but we can usually see e.g. `HoodieMergeHandle` still keep writing data even if executor already tries to kill it(see below). The reason is that during `init` in `HoodieMergeHandle`, it will first iterator `InterruptibleIterator` and build `keyToNewRecords`, if the kill status is coming after the `init` method, then `HoodieMergeHandle` might still write new records. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n23/03/23 02:28:45 INFO HoodieMergeHandle: MaxMemoryPerPartitionMerge => 1073741824\r\n23/03/23 02:28:46 INFO Executor: Executor is trying to kill task 2.1 in stage 11.0 (TID 1471), reason: another attempt succeeded\r\n23/03/23 02:28:46 INFO Executor: Executor is trying to kill task 2.1 in stage 11.0 (TID 1471), reason: Stage finished\r\n23/03/23 02:28:47 INFO HoodieMergeHandle: Number of entries in MemoryBasedMap => 0, Total size in bytes of MemoryBasedMap => 0, Number of entries in BitCaskDiskMap => 0, Size of file spilled to disk => 0\r\n23/03/23 02:28:47 INFO HoodieMergeHandle: partitionPath:grass_region=test, fileId to be merged:d3ee8406-4011-44a4-8913-8be0349a6686-0\r\n```\r\n\r\nBtw, though in `BaseHoodieQueueBasedExecutor.execute` hudi could exit immediately if the task thread is interrupted, but in `BaseHoodieQueueBasedExecutor.awaitTermination`, hudi will clean `interrupt` exception and wait extra `60` sec to let the executor to proceed. So the task will wait at least 60s when it's been killed. We need to avoid that.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\nNone\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\nNone\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdding row writer support to HoodieStreamer for bulk_insert. This will boost the bulk_insert performance for Streaming use-cases. \r\nWe check for explicit value for \"hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable\". If set to true, new row writer flow will be honored when operation type is BULK_INSERT and source type is ROW. if the config is not set or set to false, we use the same old write client based BULK_INSERT. \r\n\r\nSince this introduces new record format in StreamSync (GenericRecord and Spark Row), had to do some refactoring along the way. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBulk inserts with HoodieStreamer will see boost in write performance. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRemove redundant orderAndFilter method in DayBasedCompactionStrategy. \r\n\r\nFor example, when partitionPaths = {\"2017/01/01\", \"2017/01/02\", \"2017/01/03\"}, hoodie.compaction.daybased.target.partitions = 1.\r\n\r\nIn filterPartitionPaths method, we will get the lastest partition \"2017/01/03\", we get the corresponding operations by scanning this partition.\r\n```\r\n  public List<String> filterPartitionPaths(HoodieWriteConfig writeConfig, List<String> allPartitionPaths) {\r\n    return allPartitionPaths.stream().map(partition -> partition.replace(\"/\", \"-\"))\r\n        .sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder()).map(partitionPath -> partitionPath.replace(\"-\", \"/\"))\r\n        .collect(Collectors.toList()).subList(0, Math.min(allPartitionPaths.size(),\r\n            writeConfig.getTargetPartitionsPerDayBasedCompaction()));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in orderAndFilter method, we also group by opertions's partition path to limit the partitions. \r\n```\r\n  public List<HoodieCompactionOperation> orderAndFilter(HoodieWriteConfig writeConfig,\r\n      List<HoodieCompactionOperation> operations, List<HoodieCompactionPlan> pendingCompactionPlans) {\r\n    // Iterate through the operations and accept operations as long as we are within the configured target partitions\r\n    // limit\r\n    return operations.stream()\r\n        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(HoodieCompactionOperation::getPartitionPath)).entrySet().stream()\r\n        .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByKey(comparator)).limit(writeConfig.getTargetPartitionsPerDayBasedCompaction())\r\n        .flatMap(e -> e.getValue().stream()).collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's no need to do this redundant action.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn the previous [PR#9850](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9850), I forget to take `bulk insert` into consideration.\r\nHow to handle the case if the multiple writer contains a job with bulk insert operation?\r\n* Generated file group id: Generate a fixed file group ID because other jobs will use the fixed file group id suffix instead of random uuid suffix. The behavior needs to be consistent to prevent later writer jobs from writing the records with same primary key to different file groups.\r\n* Deal with the transaction: The conflict resolution of bulk insert could not defer to the compaction phase. Because bulk insert writers flush data into base files, if there are multiple bulk insert job, there might exists multiple base files in the same bucket.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreateIndex is added in [HUDI-4165](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5761/files), and spark 3.3 also include this in [SPARK-36895](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34148). Since `CreateIndex` uses same package `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical` in HUDI and Spark3.3, but params are not same. So it could introduce class conflict issues if we use it.\r\n\r\nOne simple modification to fix this issue is we directly move `CreateIndex` to a different package path, but I think it's not proper to do, given\r\n1. We may not get benefit from Spark to perform other analyze rules for `CreateIndex`\r\n2. Give us extra effort when moving to DSV2\r\n3. HUDI always use `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical` for logical plan(like `MergeInto`)\r\n\r\nSo here I still keep the same package path with Spark, but change\r\n1. Use the same params like Spark, so there should be no class conflict\r\n2. Since Spark2 doesn't have `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.FieldName` but `CreateIndex` requires, so we only support Index related commands from **Spark3.2**(I can also add support for Spark2 and Spark3.0, spark3.1, but not sure it's still needed or not)\r\n3. Address TODO: resolve columns for CreateIndex during Analyze stage\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\nIndex related commands are not supported anymore below Spark3.2\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\nlow\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new table config `hoodie.record.merge.mode` to control the record merging mode and behavior in the new file group reader (`HoodieFileGroupReader`) and implements event-time ordering in it.  The table config `hoodie.record.merge.mode` is going to be the single config that determines how the record merging happens in release 1.0 and beyond.  Detailed changes include:\r\n\r\n- Adds `RecordMergeMode` to define three merging mode:\r\n  - `OVERWRITE_WITH_LATEST`: using transaction time to merge records, i.e., the record from later transaction overwrites the earlier record with the same key.  This corresponds to the behavior of existing payload class `OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload`.\r\n  - `EVENT_TIME_ORDERING`: using event time as the ordering to merge records, i.e., the record with the larger event time overwrites the record with the smaller event time on the same key, regardless of transaction time. The event time or preCombine field needs to be specified by the user.  This corresponds to the behavior of existing payload class `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload`.\r\n  - `CUSTOM`: using custom merging logic specified by the user.  When a user specifies a custom record merger strategy or payload class with Avro record merger, this is going to be specified so the record merging follows user-defined logic as before.\r\n- As of now, setting `hoodie.record.merge.mode` is not mandatory (HUDI-7850 as a follow-up to make it mandatory in release 1.0).  This PR adds the inference logic based on the payload class name, payload type, and record merger strategy in `HoodieTableMetaClient` to properly set `hoodie.record.merge.mode` in the table config.\r\n- Adds merging logic of `OVERWRITE_WITH_LATEST` and `EVENT_TIME_ORDERING` in `HoodieBaseFileGroupRecordBuffer` that do not have to go through the record merger APIs to simplify the implementation (opening up for further optimization when possible).  As a fallback, user can always set `CUSTOM` as the record merge mode to leverage payload class or record merger implementation for transaction or event time-based merging.\r\n- Adds a custom `compareTo` API in `HoodieBaseFileGroupRecordBuffer` to compare ordering field values of different types, due to an issue around ordering values in the delete records (HUDI-7848).\r\n- Adjusts tests to cover the new record merge modes.\r\n\r\nNew unit and functional tests are added around the new logic.  Existing unit and functional tests using file group readers on Spark cover all different merging modes.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdd record merging mode and implement event-time ordering in the new file group reader\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nHUDI-7842 to update the docs on the website\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload` to allow the records with custom delete key (`hoodie.payload.delete.field`) and delete marker (`hoodie.payload.delete.marker`) to be properly ingested.  Before this fix, the write fails with the following exception\r\n```\r\nError for key:HoodieKey { recordKey=0 partitionPath=} is \r\njava.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present in Option\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.util.Option.get(Option.java:89)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.model.HoodieAvroRecord.prependMetaFields(HoodieAvroRecord.java:132)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle.doWrite(HoodieCreateHandle.java:144)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieWriteHandle.write(HoodieWriteHandle.java:180)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:98)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:42)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.util.queue.SimpleExecutor.execute(SimpleExecutor.java:69)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bug is introduced by the RFC-46 implementation and the refactoring on payload merging.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, the following changes are made:\r\n- After RFC-46, whether a record is a delete or not is determined at the instantiation of the record payload.  For `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload`, this means that the configuration of delete key (`hoodie.payload.delete.field`) and delete marker (`hoodie.payload.delete.marker`) must be passed to the constructor.  As the record payload (`HoodieRecordPayload`) creation is realized through Java reflection, the signature of the constructor of all existing record payload implementations intended to be used by the user has to be changed.\r\n  - For payload classes that are not affected by the bug, keep both old (without props) and new constructors with props for backwards compatibility.  For payload classes affected by the bug, i.e., extending `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload`, only the constructors with props are kept.  We change all payload classes so that the new constructor is called once in reflection, instead of twice with the first attempt failing if not including new constructors with the properties, to avoid unnecessary fallbacks and performance hits on each record.\r\n```\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  public OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload(GenericRecord record, Comparable orderingVal) {\r\n    this(record, orderingVal, EMPTY_PROPS);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  public OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload(Option<GenericRecord> record) {\r\n    this(record, EMPTY_PROPS);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload(GenericRecord record, Comparable orderingVal, Properties props) {\r\n    super(record, orderingVal, props);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload(Option<GenericRecord> record, Properties props) {\r\n    this(record.isPresent() ? record.get() : null, 0, props); // natural order\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n  - Moves general payload creation methods from `DataSourceUtils` to `HoodieRecordUtils` and modified them according to the constructor changes.\r\n  - Fixes all places around instantiating `HoodieRecordPayload` to properly pass the configurations in `Properties`.\r\n- To fix the logic for determining deletes, `BaseAvroPayload#isDeleteRecord` now takes the configuration in `Properties`, which is called by the new constructors of the payload classes.  The old method is still kept for backwards compatibility.\r\n```\r\nprotected boolean isDeleteRecord(GenericRecord genericRecord, Properties props)\r\n```\r\n  - `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload` overrides the implementation of `isDeleteRecord` to use custom delete key and marker to determine deletes, which is the behavior before RFC-46.\r\n- Adds new tests to validate that `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload` and deletes with custom delete key and marker work as expected.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes the `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload` to properly handle custom delete key (`hoodie.payload.delete.field`) and delete marker (`hoodie.payload.delete.marker`.  Deletes using default `_hoodie_is_deleted` field are not affected, i.e., working before this fix.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nHUDI-6966 for updating docs on custom payload implementation.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and

Change Logs\r\n1. val `shouldExtractPartitionValuesFromPartitionPath` in class `BaseFileOnlyRelation` get parent value if schema evolution enabled.\r\n2. `toHadoopFsRelation()` should always read partition values from path, so remove the unnecessary check code in it.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nFix the bug that read partition values not work if schema evolution applied.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nTo support incremental/CDC quereis, we do the following things:\r\n\r\n1. Extends the HoodieFileIndex as HoodieIncremtnalFileIndex, in which we override the listFiles and inputFiles methods to return only the affected files during the specified time range. We do similarly for HoodieCDCFileIndex.\r\n2. Build a factory class to build different HadoopFsRelation for different query types.\r\n3. Update the HoodieFileGroupReaderBasedParquetFileFormat to handle different query types based on the PartitionedFile information.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public apis are affected.\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nTestInsertTable#Test Bulk Insert Into Consistent Hashing Bucket Index Table failed continuously in #9776, I enabled it again and reproduced it locally. \r\n\r\nThe test will cause the write job to abort, and when `org.apache.hudi.spark3.internal.HoodieDataSourceInternalBatchWrite#abort` is called, all the subtasks may not have already been canceled. So if we roll back the current instant immediately, new files may still be written after rollback scheduled, which will cause dirty data.  This bug exists before #9776,  but only after  #9776 the test will fail. \r\n\r\nWe don't need to rollback the failed instant immediately, so to avoid this problem, I remove the line that rollback the instant in `org.apache.hudi.spark3.internal.HoodieDataSourceInternalBatchWrite#abort `. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBulk insert as row do not rollback failed instant on abort\r\n\r\n### Risk level

Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSupport functional indexes. Full design in [RFC-63](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/08361606de1a8a4b1a5471c8186ea1c8aa79eb9a/rfc/rfc-63/rfc-63.md).\r\n\r\n- Add `HoodieFunctionaIndex` interface and a concrete implementation for Spark `HoodieSparkFunctionalIndex` function.\r\n- Add `BaseHoodieFunctionalIndexClient` and its Spark implementation to build indexes.\r\n- Maintain a map of spark-sql functions in `HoodieSparkFunctionalIndex`, which is then applied on dataframe to build the index.\r\n- Support building secondary index using identity function, and we can also use colstats and bloom filters over function of column.\r\n- Index creation can be done using usual async indexer or by SQL: `create index idx_datestr on $tableName using column_stats(ts) options(func='from_unixtime', format='yyyy-MM-dd')`\r\n- Each functional index will be a partition in metadata table and index definition is stored separately (`HoodieFunctionalIndexConfig` and `HoodieFunctionalIndexMetadata` classes added for index definition).\r\n- Add new methods in `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` to initialize and update functional index. Concrete implementation only for Spark.\r\n- Add e2e tests.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers can now create indexes on not jsut columns but also functions based on columns, e.g. `DATE_FORMAT(ts, '%Y-%m-%d')`\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\nNew feature. Does not touch the core. Even the changes in metadata writer are guarded by metadata partition type.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-16T16:30:04Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T01:35:32Z","closed_at":"2023-11-03T01:35:32Z","merged_at":"2023-11-03T01:35:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"332f5d9eaa3b97c3132e995a9b405b9903b00292","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2950870088,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTUwODcwMDg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/index","name":"index","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5167491007,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNAGnvw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-1.0.0","name":"release-1.0.0","color":"E82785","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9872/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9872/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9872/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/0d2dace457162b24edaabe2c83b8d6d0c310050a","head":{"label":"codope:HUDI-5210-func-index","ref":"HUDI-5210-func-index","sha":"0d2dace457162b24edaabe2c83b8d6d0c310050a","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357429656,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc0Mjk2NTY=","name":"hudi","full_name":"codope/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/codope/hudi","description":"Upserts,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nMetadata table (MDT) has special handling for compaction. This PR ensures MDT compaction is handled in completion time based filesystem view. Previously, out-of-order commit tests were disabled. This PR now enables that test to show the file slicing happens correctly.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This PR does not remove the limitation of single writer or OCC concurrency mode from MDT. That will be tackled separately.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSupport out of order commits due to compaction in MDT with completion time view.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe found inefficiencies with bulk insert use case where in delta streamer code path we were taking a performance hit for doing row to avro conversion when transformer is hooked on. This PR addresses to avoid these unnecessary conversions by directly passing hoodie spark record to the write client. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nInitial testing of this PR shows the following
