<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

When the users register extra (internal or external) services via Istio ServiceEntry, the services are shown as `UNKNOWN` because no metadata or Kubernetes Service available for these entries.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a ServiceEntry registry, similar to [Kubernetes Service registry](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/oap-server/server-receiver-plugin/envoy-metrics-receiver-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/receiver/envoy/als/k8s/K8SServiceRegistry.java). When all the existing analyzers cannot resolve the service, the ServiceEntry registry will be consulted, and if any ServiceEntry for the IP is found, the service is resolved.\r\n\r\n## How is IP mapped to ServiceEntry\r\n\r\n### ServiceEntry with `resolution: STATIC`\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n\r\n---\r\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\r\nkind: ServiceEntry\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: internal-svc-httpbin-2\r\nspec:\r\n  hosts:\r\n    - httpbin.zhenxu.ke # not used\r\n  addresses:\r\n    - 1.2.3.4\r\n  ports:\r\n    - number: 80\r\n      name: http\r\n      protocol: HTTP\r\n  location: MESH_INTERNAL\r\n  resolution: STATIC\r\n  endpoints:\r\n    - address: 10.170.0.9\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this SE, we can send requests to `1.2.3.4`, which is passed to `10.170.0.9` at the end. In this case, IP `10.170.0.9` in the Envoy access log is resolved to a service named `internal-svc-httpbin-2`, so the topology looks like\r\n\r\n<img width=\"586\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/assets/15965696/408aff1d-fbce-469c-8fe7-be95913fc102\">\r\n\r\n### ServiceEntry with `resolution: DNS` or `resolution: DNS_ROUND_ROBIN`\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\r\nkind: ServiceEntry\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: external-svc-httpbin\r\nspec:\r\n  hosts:\r\n    - httpbin.org\r\n  ports:\r\n    - number: 80\r\n      name: http\r\n      protocol: HTTP\r\n  location: MESH_EXTERNAL\r\n  resolution: DNS\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, we can send requests to `httpbin.org` (assuming `meshConfig.outboundTrafficPolicy.mode=REGISTRY_ONLY` is set when installing Istio), and the real IP from the Envoy access log is dynamically resolved through DNS, thus, in this PR, we perform a DNS resolution request (periodically) and cache the IPs of that domain name `httpbin.org`, and lookup the real IP from the Envoy access log in the cached IPs, if found any, map the IP from the access log to the ServiceEntry and compose a service from the SE.\r\n\r\n### ServiceEntry with `resolution: NONE`\r\n\r\nDidn't take care of this case in this pull request.","created_at":"2023-06-14T09:48:06Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T12:11:23Z","closed_at":"2023-06-15T12:11:19Z","merged_at":"2023-06-15T12:11:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"a23f905ce01bd782f0e60ddec014e02a7d6b02f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP

In matching the first rule scenario, the new implementation(mostly due to split performance), it is 40% fast than the previous implementation.\r\n2. Quick match has a huge advantage in GC(time and cost) and memory cost(alloc, G1 Eden and G1 Old) in every case. In my 64G M1 Max env, the regex matching even causes full GC just in the benchmark, which is only running in 2:11 mins. The regex would be a disaster for product env memory.\r\n3. The quick match only has lower performance when the number of pattern rules is less than 4, which is nearly impossible. Even for that, Regex matching costs most GC and memory alloc in one-time match, and 3-time cost in 4 times match.\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n1. I made the URI cache only works in AI pipeline works, as it should. This was a bug in the previous commit.\r\n1. `/` is not required in this case, as generally, the pattern recognition should work well for demo name as well. @Superskyyy
