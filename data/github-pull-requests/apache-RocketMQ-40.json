Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [√] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [√] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [√] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [√] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [√] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

module.\r\n(3)update  PlainAccessValidatorTest in rocketmq acl module.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\ntest cases have been validated\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAccording to the network topology of RocketMQ, it’s possible that a broker has hundreds of (even thousands of) netty channels established with members (especially consumers). If each stateless handler can be shared by all of these channels, memory should be saved slightly.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Annotate stateless netty handlers with @Sharable.\r\nHandshakeHandler\r\nNettyEncoder\r\nNettyConnectManageHandler\r\nNettyServerHandler\r\n\r\n2. Share each single-instanced handler with all the server-side channels, instead of creating a new handler instance whenever a channel comes.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt functions well and passed all the unit tests after this change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix #598 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nFor half messages that check times exceed the max check times(15 by default), not doing anything in here\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void resolveDiscardMsg(MessageExt msgExt) {\r\n        log.error(\"MsgExt:{} has been checked too many times, so discard it\", msgExt);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand instead of this, put it into a system topic will be more meaningful. And you can also reopen message check logic manually.\r\n(The logic of reopen message check will be submitted later.)\r\n\r\nBrief Design：\r\n1. Complement the logic of DefaultTransactionalMessageCheckListener#resolveDiscardMsg to put half messages to a system topic TRANS_CHECK_MAX_TIME_TOPIC.\r\n2. add a new RequestCode RESUME_CHECK_HALF_MESSAGE(323) to enable resuming check logic by using DefaultMQAdminExt\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n1. Implement DefaultTransactionalMessageCheckListener#resolveDiscardMsg\r\n2. add `resumeCheckHalfMessage` method to AdminBrokerProcessor.java to recieve resume request from client.\r\n3. add `resumeCheckHalfMessage` in MQClientAPIImpl.java to send resume request to broker.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [√] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [√] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [√] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [√] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [√] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix [issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/604)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRelease semaphore if timeout;\r\nChange RemotingTooMuchRequestException to RemotingTimeoutException if timeout.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\nhandle todo\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix [issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/604)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRelease semaphore if timeout;\r\nChange RemotingTooMuchRequestException to RemotingTimeoutException if timeout.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThere are some minor errors in SelectorParser.jj, and it should work like ActiveMQ using javacc plugin\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- An incorrect import of LRUCache was deleted from SelectorParser.jj\r\n- Add EOF token to match the end of selector sql, so selector like \"a < 10bbbbb\" will fail to parse, rather than parse out (a < 10)\r\n- Changed the way quotes are compared so that there are no compile error with '\\u005c' in generated SelectorParser.java\r\n- add javacc plugin to automatically generate code, so we don't have to manual generate code with javacc command line when each time of .jj updated\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nNo Java code was modified and all the exist tests passed\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-13T05:58:12Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T12:24:15Z","closed_at":"2020-03-30T12:24:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"814e99a57f0fcc03f4ab78d870378a4872e6977c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/d978b574d79b629c40877cf9d6645231beedd304","head":{"label":"zhangyanc:selector_parse_eof","ref":"selector_parse_eof","sha":"d978b574d79b629c40877cf9d6645231beedd304","user":{"login":"zhangyanc","id":13622824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjIyODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13622824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyanc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161573896,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjE1NzM4OTY=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"zhangyanc/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangyanc","id":13622824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjIyODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13622824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyanc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyanc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyanc/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\nSupport the feature which trace topic name value can be configurable by users.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nThe change codes are as followers.Users can configure the trace topic name in broker sides.And then,they can use their predefined trace topic name to send or consumer the message.At last,they can use this trace topic name in the rocketmq's console project.Of course,they can use the default trace topic name value—\"RMQ_SYS_TRACK_TRACE\".\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nI have already test this change code in my rocketmq cluster enviroment. \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-11T08:17:52Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T13:22:08Z","closed_at":"2018-12-19T11:54:04Z","merged_at":"2018-12-19T11:54:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"d572ffab7c344140124d981b439dcbec2e16dc4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/3/labels","id":3502188,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzUwMjE4OA==","number":3,"title":"4.4.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":41,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-17T08:36:52Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T09:21:06Z","due_on":"2019-01-26T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-01-24T09:21:06Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/600/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/600/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/600/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/d480c8123fe515eae8ab2447ddede37daa464df0","head":{"label":"zongtanghu:msg_track","ref":"msg_track","sha":"d480c8123fe515eae8ab2447ddede37daa464df0","user":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155959379,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTU5NTkzNzk=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"zongtanghu/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

is the purpose of the change\r\nMessage track trace refers to the consumption processing of a message which is sent from the producer instance has arrived the broker,and then has been consumed by the consumer instance.In the whole process, the information of time, location and other related services(including Client and Broker) is aggregated into the complete link information of message communication.\r\nIn MQ system, the complete link of a message contains three roles: producer, broker server and consumer.In the process of message communicaton, each role adds relevant information to the track trace link.By aggregating these information,it can provide some powerful support to user.\r\nAbout the Apache RocketMQ project,I will add the feature of message track trace which can help users query every complete link data of a message exactly.This funcation is important to RocketMQ,especially in some financial application fields.\r\n\r\nBrief changelog\r\nLook at the client/broker/common/tools/example/logappender/test module.\r\nLook at the rocketmq/distribution/conf/2m-noslave\r\n(1)broker-a.properties file.\r\n(2)broker-b.properties file.\r\n(3)broker-trace.properties file.\r\n\r\nVerifying this change\r\n(1)the special storing for message track trace broker configuration files Join the flag as follows:\r\nautoTraceBrokerEnable=true\r\n(2)the normal broker configuration files Join the flag as follows:\r\nautoTraceBrokerEnable=false\r\n\r\n##Architecture and design\r\nWe plan to design the function of message track trace including its store part and client instance collecting.The total architecture has two part below:\r\n（1）Client instance collects the infomation of message track trace\r\nThe design of client architecture above as follows:\r\n（a）.\"producer and consumer multi-thread module, and Blocking Queue\"：here, in client,as a producer model,we can collect the infomation(such as,sending and consuming message cost time,broker store time,broker stored ip address and so on) and put this information into the Blocking Queue.And as s consumer model,use a thread called \"MQ-AsyncArrayDispatcher\" to take the message track trace infomation from Blocking Queue.Then this asynchronous thread( called \"MQ-AsyncArrayDispatcher\") pack the message track trace element as AsyncAppenderRequest task and submit to the thead pool.\r\nLast,the main execution process of AsyncAppenderRequest task is sending the message track trace infomation which is collected above from client side to a special broker node which is redefined in below chapter.\r\n（b）.define a new pair hook which is implementation of the“SendMessageHook/ConsumeMessageHook”,from this,we can collect message track trace data before and after publishing and subscribing messages.\r\n（2）Redefine a special broker node to store message track trace data\r\nAs shown in the above picture,we can define a specail broker service node which can store the message track trace data in a common RocketMQ cluster.Here,we can add a flag(such as autoTraceBrokerEnable) in broker.properties file and use this variable to define Whether this broker is a specail node for storing message track trace data.\r\n（a）autoTraceBrokerEnable is false.This indicates this broker is an ordinary node,then \"Trace_Topic\" will not be created in this node.And it will still follow the original processing flow without any change.\r\n（b）autoTraceBrokerEnable is true.This indicates broker is an special node,which stores the message track trace data specailly.And The \"Trace_Topic\" is automatically created during the Broker's startup phase,this node automatically registers its owned set of topics in memory to nameserver(including Trace_Topic).Thus,in a RocketMQ cluster,there is only a specail broker node which stores message track trace datas.And clients(including publishing and subscribing messages) knows which broker node to send message trace data after they try fetch topic routing info from nameserver.\r\n（3）How to solve the query message track trace data by original topic\r\nFor example,Topic which saves message track trace data is called \"RMQ_SYS_TRACE_DATA_XXX\" is instead of Topic of original data.But，message query(By messageId + topic,topic+ key or topic) which still uses original data on RocketMQ console side can't query the expected result for us.Here, we can fill in the keyset field of the message track trace data by using msgId (not offset MsgId) or Key of the original message content when send the message track trace data collected by the client, so the IndexFile index of the Broker end can be built according to the msgId or Key of the original message.\r\nAnd at the broker side,we can invokes the queryMessage() method of the storage part through the QueryMessageProcessor Business processor.\r\n（4）Finishing querying messages track trace datas in console\r\nFisrtly,the console project is based on spring boot technology,so we can finish querying messages track track datas in this project.The basic design is using thread pool to send a RPC request to the redefined broker node to get the message track trace data.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR.\r\n\r\n  Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n  Format the pull request title like [ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n  Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n  Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in test module.\r\n  Run mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle to make sure basic checks pass. Run mvn clean install -DskipITs to make sure unit-test pass. Run mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n  If this contribution is large, please file an Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement.","created_at":"2018-12-10T06:33:38Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T13:22:20Z","closed_at":"2018-12-10T09:00:22Z","merged_at":"2018-12-10T09:00:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"c50ada6ef1ffabae105efb234c9c98bf4c4c8c06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/3/labels","id":3502188,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzUwMjE4OA==","number":3,"title":"4.4.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":41,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-17T08:36:52Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T09:21:06Z","due_on":"2019-01-26T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-01-24T09:21:06Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/47556d6a3694bad3e2eaac9ea61f9086ad62ce9b","head":{"label":"zongtanghu:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"47556d6a3694bad3e2eaac9ea61f9086ad62ce9b","user":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155959379,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTU5NTkzNzk=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"zongtanghu/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [√] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfix [issue590](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/590)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nI deleted filterserv related code and wrote the tag filter eaxmple code. In addition, I \r\nadded @deprecated to this function org.apache.rocketmq.client.consumer.DefaultMQPushConsumer#subscribe(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String), which relate to filterserv code\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-08T13:49:11Z","updated_at":"2018-12-15T06:13:56Z","closed_at":"2018-12-15T06:13:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a72ce5aa1c2eab9d74e75dfab25fe98abe5fdf19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/b11d1a39120dfeb0d01535414abaed5c6ea2b0ef","head":{"label":"RongtongJin:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"b11d1a39120dfeb0d01535414abaed5c6ea2b0ef","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"5d3560dc5c3e546b09bc09b9298a2b4433835b85","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq","description":"Apache

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate the year info in NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-02T10:22:58Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T13:25:04Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:30:06Z","merged_at":"2018-12-07T02:30:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"f27dc755114235bcf6152b2f671cfcf0f6f2674c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/3/labels","id":3502188,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzUwMjE4OA==","number":3,"title":"4.4.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":41,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-17T08:36:52Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T09:21:06Z","due_on":"2019-01-26T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-01-24T09:21:06Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/a422ac4417eaf2e10ac0a1feb1f05c1411a54cb9","head":{"label":"jijs:common_modify_max_body_size","ref":"common_modify_max_body_size","sha":"a422ac4417eaf2e10ac0a1feb1f05c1411a54cb9","user":{"login":"jijs","id":13843000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODQzMDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13843000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs","html_url":"https://github.com/jijs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":160034159,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjAwMzQxNTk=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"jijs/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jijs","id":13843000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODQzMDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13843000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs","html_url":"https://github.com/jijs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jijs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jijs/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

is the purpose of the change?\r\n\r\nIn the part of RocketMQ store,the goal of the warm-up mappedFile is that prewrite some random value into memory page corresponding to the mappedFile,so the target memory will swap to the physical memory in advance.But in fact,this action will result in double IO to the operation system.First IO is in the warm-up MappedFile,and secode IO is in the process of write message data into pagecache.\r\n\r\n2.Optimization change action\r\nBecause of the above reason,we can remove the part of write some random value,prevent-gc and force flush codes in the warm-up method.In the mmapOperation,we can call mlock() method directly.","created_at":"2018-11-29T15:28:44Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T08:36:13Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T08:36:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f368586b26e257146d250072b2fbbbc4713645a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/3eea1e708d13f18c6813f5a8215f8d48e4b8a83d","head":{"label":"zongtanghu:develop_fix_warmUpFile","ref":"develop_fix_warmUpFile","sha":"3eea1e708d13f18c6813f5a8215f8d48e4b8a83d","user":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155959379,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTU5NTkzNzk=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"zongtanghu/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\nmake the acl ligther\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nThe files are in directory org.apache.rocketmq.acl.plug\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [√] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [√] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\nMessage track trace refers to the consumption processing of a message which is sent from the producer instance has arrived the broker,and then has been consumed by the consumer instance.In the whole process, the information of time, location and other related services(including Client and Broker) is aggregated into the complete link information of message communication.\r\nIn MQ system, the complete link of a message contains three roles: producer, broker server and consumer.In the process of message communicaton, each role adds relevant information to the track trace link.By aggregating these information,it can provide some powerful support to user.\r\nAbout the Apache RocketMQ project,I will add the feature of message track trace which can help users query every complete link data of a message exactly.This funcation is important to RocketMQ,especially in some  financial application fields.\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nLook at the client/broker/common/tools/example/logappender/test module.\r\nLook at the rocketmq/distribution/conf/2m-noslave\r\n(1)broker-a.properties file.\r\n(2)broker-b.properties file.\r\n(3)broker-trace.properties file.\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n(1)the special storing for message track trace broker configuration files Join the flag as follows:\r\nautoTraceBrokerEnable=true\r\n(2)the normal broker configuration files Join the flag as follows:\r\nautoTraceBrokerEnable=false\r\n\r\n##Architecture and design\r\n We plan to design the function of message track trace including its store part and client instance collecting.The total architecture has two part below:\r\n    （1）Client instance collects the infomation of message track trace \r\n    The design of client architecture above as follows:\r\n    （a）.\"producer and consumer multi-thread module, and Blocking Queue\"：here, in client,as a producer model,we can collect the infomation(such as,sending and consuming message cost time,broker store time,broker stored ip address and so on) and put this information into the Blocking Queue.And as s consumer model,use a thread called \"MQ-AsyncArrayDispatcher\" to take the message track trace infomation from Blocking Queue.Then this asynchronous thread( called \"MQ-AsyncArrayDispatcher\") pack the message track trace element as AsyncAppenderRequest task and submit to the thead pool.\r\n    Last,the main execution process of  AsyncAppenderRequest task is sending the message track trace infomation which is collected above from client side to a special broker node which is redefined in below chapter.\r\n    （b）.define a new pair hook which is implementation of the“SendMessageHook/ConsumeMessageHook”,from this,we can collect message track trace data  before and after publishing and subscribing messages.\r\n    （2）Redefine a special broker node to store message track trace data\r\n    As shown in the above picture,we can define a specail broker service node which can store the message track trace data in a common RocketMQ cluster.Here,we can add a flag(such as autoTraceBrokerEnable) in broker.properties file and use this variable to define Whether this broker is a specail node for storing message track trace data.\r\n    （a）autoTraceBrokerEnable is false.This indicates this broker is an ordinary node,then \"Trace_Topic\" will not be created in this node.And it will still follow the original processing flow without any change.\r\n    （b）autoTraceBrokerEnable is true.This indicates broker is an special node,which stores the message track trace data specailly.And The \"Trace_Topic\" is automatically created during the Broker's startup phase,this node automatically registers its owned set of topics in memory to nameserver(including Trace_Topic).Thus,in a RocketMQ cluster,there is only a specail broker node which stores message track trace datas.And clients(including publishing and subscribing messages) knows which broker node to send message trace data after they try fetch topic routing info from nameserver.\r\n    （3）How to solve the query message track trace data by original topic                 \r\n For example,Topic which saves message track trace data is called \"RMQ_SYS_TRACE_DATA_XXX\" is instead of Topic of original data.But，message query(By messageId + topic,topic+ key or topic) which still uses original data on RocketMQ console side can't query the expected result for us.Here, we can fill in the keyset field of the message track trace data by using msgId (not offset MsgId) or Key of the original message content when send the message track trace data collected by the client, so the IndexFile index of the Broker end can be built according to the msgId or Key of the original message.\r\n    And at the broker side,we can invokes the queryMessage() method of the storage part through the QueryMessageProcessor Business processor.\r\n    （4）Finishing querying messages track trace datas in console\r\n    Fisrtly,the console project is based on spring boot technology,so we can finish querying messages track track datas in this project.The basic design is using thread pool to send a RPC request to the redefined broker node to get the message track trace data.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[Related issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/502)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Interface MQConsumer add four method to support MessageSelector.\r\n2. Add relevant integration test case.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-02T13:38:31Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T07:49:53Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T02:27:44Z","merged_at":"2018-11-27T02:27:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"82a59610b8c53edd8713ea04e775222ba277dbfd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":954854570,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NTQ4NTQ1NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/new%20feature","name":"type/new

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[Related issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/502)\r\nAdd pull consumer sql92 filter support.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Add four new interface in MQPullConsumer to support MessageSelector.\r\n2. Add integration test case for new interface.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-02T12:47:11Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T11:44:41Z","closed_at":"2018-11-02T12:56:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8c77c7938711695df4e7ab35e0f8ab966dbf6e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":954854570,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NTQ4NTQ1NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/new%20feature","name":"type/new

Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [√] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [√] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the issue [478](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/478)\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

@Deprecated in Class ClientConfig\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #433\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1、Delete maven-failsafe-plugin in plugins\r\n2、Add excludes for maven-surefire-plugin\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-04T05:42:19Z","updated_at":"2018-09-27T11:18:03Z","closed_at":"2018-09-10T03:20:05Z","merged_at":"2018-09-10T03:20:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"53a63460d3a1599a6c51058bb51a73746233022d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/4/labels","id":3693156,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzY5MzE1Ng==","number":4,"title":"4.3.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":17,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-27T11:16:50Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T06:28:42Z","due_on":"2018-10-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:23Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/b620b9c8d272737bf6aefa30547e54b472daef7c","head":{"label":"joewee:fix-rocketMQClient","ref":"fix-rocketMQClient","sha":"b620b9c8d272737bf6aefa30547e54b472daef7c","user":{"login":"joewee","id":6845957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDU5NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6845957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee","html_url":"https://github.com/joewee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147292473,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDcyOTI0NzM=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"joewee/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"joewee","id":6845957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDU5NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6845957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee","html_url":"https://github.com/joewee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/joewee/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\nFix issue #433 \r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nChange the Configuration of jacoco-maven-plugin in pom.xml\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove scripts related to mqfiltersrv.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T11:57:44Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T05:45:23Z","closed_at":"2018-08-29T02:24:20Z","merged_at":"2018-08-29T02:24:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"37a642cc12730873f505dcc4130aa73be4df3999","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/47f69c17b12e1b5c34b70546c840e33b8ff919bd","head":{"label":"duhengforever:develop_filter","ref":"develop_filter","sha":"47f69c17b12e1b5c34b70546c840e33b8ff919bd","user":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139727330,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk3MjczMzA=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"duhengforever/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/392\r\n to fix this isuue\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nthere is no need to clear the queue anymore, because the tasks in the queue will be processed after shutdown. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nverify the logic correction use unit test\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPull Request for ACL feature request\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRPCHook impl, and acl table store and communication\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nverified, compile succeed locally\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

just\r\n```\r\nSystem.setProperty(\"rocketmq.user\",\"user1\")\r\nDefaultMQProducer producer = new DefaultMQProducer(\"\");\r\n```\r\nthen  everything is the same to before usage.\r\n\r\nwhen the

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-09T00:33:21Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T03:08:39Z","closed_at":"2018-08-21T03:08:39Z","merged_at":"2018-08-21T03:08:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"cdf4042821e281974dd69d04bb792d856b6fb21a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/398/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/398/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/398/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/79890cb315b8a693c10cb945eeb5ebe73d022187","head":{"label":"duhengforever:develop_compatibility_issue","ref":"develop_compatibility_issue","sha":"79890cb315b8a693c10cb945eeb5ebe73d022187","user":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139727330,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk3MjczMzA=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"duhengforever/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever/rocketmq","description":"Mirror
