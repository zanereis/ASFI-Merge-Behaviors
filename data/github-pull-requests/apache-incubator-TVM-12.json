allows incorporation of handcrafted kernels into the compilation stack and being invoked by Relax just like TIR or any other ordinary operator. This PR simplifies its workflow.\r\n\r\nThe system consists of the abstract base class `ExternModule` and its two derivatives:\r\n- `.o` (object files) can be linked using `ObjectModule`.\r\n- `.cpp` (C++ files) and `.cu` (CUDA files) can be compiled and linked into the system usung `SourceModule`.\r\n\r\n**Symbols, and shape/dtype inference.** To provide the system with sufficient information about the kernels, it is required to provide all symbols of an external module, as well as a method for each symbol that tells the system about the output dtype/shape of this symbol.\r\n\r\nConsider a case where function `my_func` accepts two tensors, `a` of shape `(x, y, 1)`, `b` of shape `(y, z, 5)`, and then produces a tensor `c` of shape `(x, y, z, 9)`, the shape/dtype inference function should look like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef shape_dtype_inference(a, b):\r\n  x, y, _ = a.shape\r\n  _, z, _ = b.shape\r\n  return nn.Tensor.placeholder((x, y, z, 9), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding the interface, the symbols and their corresponding shape/dtype inference function should be provided as a Python dictionary that maps each symbol to the function as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsymbols={\r\n  \"my_func\": shape_dtype_inference,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Calling convention.** All external modules now follows \"destination-passing-style\" (DPS) calling convention, which means the returned tensors are pre-allocated by the system already and passed in as an argument of the external\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nReuse the example above, the implementation of `my_func` should include three parameters in its signature, where tensors are represented using DLTensor from DLPack, the de facto standard of in-memory representation of tensors. More info on DLPack: https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack/blob/v0.8/include/dlpack/dlpack.h#L163-L206.\r\n\r\nTo expose the symbol, `TVM_DLL_EXPORT_TYPED_FUNC(symbol, function)` is guaranteed available:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n// those headers are guaranteed to be available\r\n#include <dlpack/dlpack.h>\r\n#include <tvm/runtime/data_type.h>\r\n#include <tvm/runtime/packed_func.h>\r\nnamespace {\r\n// anonymous namespace hides the symbol `_my_func_impl` from other TUs\r\nint _my_func_impl(DLTensor* a, DLTensor* b, DLTensor* c) {\r\n// `a` and `b` are inputs, and `c` is the output\r\n}\r\n}\r\n// expose symbol `my_func` instead of `_my_func_impl`\r\nTVM_DLL_EXPORT_TYPED_FUNC(my_func, _my_func_impl);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**A compiler pass `AttachExternModules`.** It is introduced to attach a list of `nn.ExternModule`s into an IRModule at any stage of the compilation pipeline, and attach the compiled external modules as `runtime.Module`s into IRModule's `external_mods` attribute. It is required by linking in `relax.build`, but with the existence of this pass, source compilation can be deferred to arbitrary stage of TVM compilation.\r\n\r\n**Caveats.** It is required to call `nn.add_extern` to register external modules exactly once during `export_tvm`. Each symbol should be registered exactly once to avoid potential conflicts, and otherwise an error will be raised. This programming model might be a bit of constraint, and we will consider loose it slightly in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, for backward compatibility, `ExternModule`s are exported from `export_tvm` only when `allow_extern` flag is turned on. Otherwise, any external module will cause an exception asking to turn on the flag.","created_at":"2023-12-15T04:44:44Z","updated_at":"2023-12-16T21:59:51Z","closed_at":"2023-12-16T21:59:51Z","merged_at":"2023-12-16T21:59:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0e58987b07743c6880e3d73a6b15cb7ea995783","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16247/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16247/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16247/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/a164d89ca609d6cfb8697ddf30d2480b291eb042","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-12-14/refactor-extern-module","ref":"feature/2023-12-14/refactor-extern-module","sha":"a164d89ca609d6cfb8697ddf30d2480b291eb042","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

preserved.","created_at":"2023-12-14T22:04:32Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T12:25:07Z","closed_at":"2023-12-15T12:25:07Z","merged_at":"2023-12-15T12:25:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b1fa298388cca09235479fba57871e9a056f910","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8c882f2a515bec6fbee6122ee9005f863f337e92","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-12-14/non-build","ref":"feature/2023-12-14/non-build","sha":"8c882f2a515bec6fbee6122ee9005f863f337e92","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

=\r\n[[9.1025043e-01 5.6659997e-01 8.7828696e-01 5.5273587e-01 1.8565023e-01]\r\n [8.0204010e-04 5.5512893e-01 9.7184986e-01 3.2060379e-01 7.5654179e-01]\r\n [9.5829505e-01 7.7954692e-01 1.3110173e-01

`op.debug_func(name=\"func_name_in_reigstry\", *args)`\r\nfurther extends this approach to supporting *arbitrary* debug functions\r\nduring runtime. Besides giving runtime values corresponding to its compile-time\r\narguments passed in by users, it further gives an additional argument `lineno`\r\nwhich reflects the filename and line number of the compile-time call site.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the code below\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@tvm.register_func(\"my_test\")\r\ndef _debug(lineno: str, tensor, int_var) -> None:\r\n  ...\r\n\r\nclass Layer(nn.Module):\r\n  def forward(self, x: nn.Tensor, v: tir.Var):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name\r\n    op.debug_func(\"my_test\", x, v)\r\n    return x\r\n```\r\n\r\nfinds the Python function registered as `my_test` during runtime, and\r\nwill invoke it with the runtime value of a tensor and a TIR scalar variable.\r\nSee `tests/python/relax/test_frontend_nn_debug.py` for more details.","created_at":"2023-12-14T05:55:54Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T22:59:29Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T22:59:29Z","merged_at":"2023-12-14T22:59:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1964eceb59431147af43979393ecb1217be9fb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bfa6c842916e6e539bb9805d0c4e5ff94efe2fd6","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-12-03/add-debug-method","ref":"feature/2023-12-03/add-debug-method","sha":"bfa6c842916e6e539bb9805d0c4e5ff94efe2fd6","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15233\r\n\r\nThis is the Milestone 2 for MSC: Use msc.runtime.Manager to manage the compiling pipeline && tools.\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 2 will be split into some steps:\r\nM2.1 Add Manager for compile pipeline\r\nM2.2 Add pruner for model pruning\r\nM2.3 Add tracker for track layer datas\r\n**M2.4 Add quantizer for quantize model**\r\n\r\nQuantization is widely used as model optimization methods. MSC implementation of quantizer differs from other frameworks. The quantization process is described as a tool and dispatched to torch/tvm/tensorrt when needed. In this way, the quantization of tvm can be \"simulated\" in torch (essential for QAT).\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @junrushao

And the errors are silent, meaning only particular inputs trigger the errors. \r\nThese severe yet slient errors accumulate along the computational graph, harming the security of the models.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe results of optimized models remains consistent with that of the un-optimized models.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSignificant discrepancies are between un-optimized and optimized models' results. \r\nThe relative error  caused by optimization is more than 0.9 when the model has several operators and its type is float32. (tvm's built-in tolerance is 10^-4)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/tvm/assets/40557101/9910d28a-6dd6-4b19-af9c-848ca05464b6)\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nNormal\r\n\r\n### Steps to

From the relay ir, we know tan_1 and sum have different predecessors. \r\nThis error occurs because the reshape node is named without distinguishing between different reshapes.\r\n\r\nAfter modifying graph_executor_codegen.cc, the dumped graph is able to correctly represent the data flow relationships.\r\n\r\n...\r\n{\r\n    \"op\": \"tvmgen_default_fused_sum\",\r\n    \"inputs\": [ \"reshape_nop_0\" ],\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"op\": \"tvmgen_default_fused_tan\",\r\n    \"inputs\": [\"tvmgen_default_fused_sum\" ],\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"op\": \"tvmgen_default_fused_tan_1\",\r\n    \"inputs\": [\"reshape_nop_1\"],\r\n}\r\n...\r\n\r\nIt is essential to fix this bug  for tracing numerical errors introduced by the compliation.\r\n\r\n##  Numerical errors introduced by TVM?\r\n \r\nWe find unacceptable numerical errors exist between optimized and un-optimized models. \r\nTwo imprecise passes cause the errors. And the errors are silent, meaning only particular inputs trigger the errors. \r\nThese severe yet slient errors accumulate along the computational graph, harming the security of the models.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe results of optimized models remains consistent with that of the un-optimized models.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSignificant discrepancies are between un-optimized and optimized models' results. \r\nThe relative error  caused by optimization is more than 0.9 when the model has several operators and its type is float32. (tvm's built-in tolerance is 10^-4)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/tvm/assets/40557101/9910d28a-6dd6-4b19-af9c-848ca05464b6)\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nNormal\r\n\r\n### Steps to

PR solves the problem of not finding the key of `param_debug_name_map` with \"name\", an attribute of `prim::GetAttr`, when `inline_input_quant_params_for_fx` replacing `prim::GetAttr` with `prim::Constant`. This problem occurs when the model is quantized by each sub-models with quantize_fx, and the zero point and scale variable names are different from the name, the attribute of `prim::GetAttr`. To solve this, when modifying all `prim::GetAttr` to `prim::Constant`, modify to access `param_debug_name_map` by using the `node.output.debugName()` . The reason is that `nodes.output().debugName()` as shown pattern like `.<number>` at the end of their names, which distinguishes same name and that can be found in `param_debug_name_map`\r\n\r\n-

is a pull request for MSC(Multi-System Compile)\r\nRFC: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-unity-msc-introduction-to-multi-system-compiler/15251/5\r\nTracking issue: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15233\r\n\r\nThis is the Milestone 2 for MSC: Use msc.runtime.Manager to manage the compiling pipeline && tools.\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 2 will be split into some steps:\r\nM2.1 Add Manager for compile pipeline\r\nM2.2 Add pruner for model pruning\r\n**M2.3 Add tracker for track layer datas**\r\nM2.4 Add quantizer for quantize model\r\n\r\nTracker is designed to dump datas of each layer in different frameworks and compare their difference. The tracker is important tool in 2 scenarios: 1. Debugging the compiling process; 2. Dump datas for layer unit test (HPC development). \r\nThus the tracker helps in accuracy check and plugin testing.\r\n\r\nTracker helps debugging the model like polygraphy (https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/polygraphy/docs/index.html). and supports all the frameworks that msc support.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @junrushao

PR implements a pass that automatically extracts DataflowBlocks out of binding blocks (i.e., groups consecutive pure operations in binding blocks into a dataflow block).\r\n\r\nNote that this pass makes use of `CanonicalizeBindings` and in the process of testing it, I encountered bugs in `CanonicalizeBindings` that I deal with in here:\r\n1. `CanonicalizeBindings` dealt with the case of a var that appeared only inside a DataflowBlock (demoted to a dataflow var), but it made a mistake in cases where a var was used only inside DataflowBlocks, plural, meaning outside the one where it was defined (thus it should be exposed as an output and thus not demoted to a dataflow var).\r\n2. `CanonicalizeBindings` did not handle inner functions correctly. It will correctly recurse into inner functions and also treat any captured vars as appearing outside their original dataflow block.","created_at":"2023-12-05T04:12:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T22:44:11Z","closed_at":"2023-12-13T22:44:11Z","merged_at":"2023-12-13T22:44:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe89ccc360838847f52eb96181ffe69477000835","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

to this commit, the normalizer printed a warning whenever a lowering pass produced a `SeqExpr` containing a non-dataflow `BindingBlock` within a `DataflowBlock`.

If there are no `DataflowVar` instances used in the `BindingBlock`, no warning is required.","created_at":"2023-12-01T21:44:29Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T20:00:34Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T20:00:31Z","merged_at":"2023-12-14T20:00:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"6118b770b1dada9630631286c76cd7501374446e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16195/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16195/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16195/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/6a647fee2221169f96b835517eeae153ecf06485","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_improved_nested_seqexpr_error_check","ref":"unity_improved_nested_seqexpr_error_check","sha":"6a647fee2221169f96b835517eeae153ecf06485","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `CanonicalizeBindings` transform handled trivial bindings, including binding of a `DataflowVar` to a `Var`, and usage of `Var` where a `DataflowVar` should be used instead.  However, it did not handle the case where both of these occur at the same time.  That is, a binding of `var_x = dataflow_y`, where `var_x` is only used within the dataflow block.  For these cases, `CanonicalizeBindings` would need to be run repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `CanonicalizeBindings` to check if a trivial binding is used outside the dataflow block.  This avoids producing output that requires further canonicalization.","created_at":"2023-12-01T21:38:19Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T03:07:36Z","closed_at":"2023-12-05T23:19:21Z","merged_at":"2023-12-05T23:19:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"34fd234f5513775fae7060d71a95486a17f61d03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/df189ef53a47633abe506f8770457cdacd503258","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_canonicalize_bindings_edge_cases","ref":"unity_canonicalize_bindings_edge_cases","sha":"df189ef53a47633abe506f8770457cdacd503258","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

env：AMD RX 7600\r\nI debugged the MIOpen source code for a specific reason. During the model compilation phase, the Python side calls the conv2d.setup interface, invoking MIOpen's findConvForwardAlgorithm interface to find the appropriate algorithm. Subsequently, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair is registered within the current invokers. Then, without terminating the current process, during the inference stage, the invoker can identify the Algorithm for the corresponding layer-problem and perform direct inference.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the current process is exited and the pre-compiled model is executed without the prior invocation of findConvForwardAlgorithm during the compilation phase, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair won't be registered within the invokers. As a result, the inference stage will report an error stating \"MIOpen Error: No invoker was registered for convolution forward.\"\r\n\r\nBased on the distinction between MIOpen and cuDNN invocation provided by the MIOpen official documentation, the typical sequence for calling Convolution APIs in MIOpen is as follows:\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*GetWorkSpaceSize(): This function returns the workspace size required by the Find() operation.\r\n\r\nmiopenFindConvolution*Algorithm(): This function returns performance information about various algorithms.\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*(): Actual convolution operation.\r\n\r\nThe official documentation emphasizes that calling miopenFindConvolution*Algorithm() is mandatory before using any Convolution API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, according to the documentation found at https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/MIOpen/en/latest/convolution.html#miopenfindconvolutionforwardalgorithm, the last parameter of the miopenFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithm interface, exhaustiveSearch, should be set to 1 (true):\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 0, MIOpen will seek the first kernel with a configuration match. If no configuration match is found, a default configuration will be returned.\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 1, MIOpen will search for the best kernel for the provided configuration. If a match is not found, an exhaustive search is performed by running individual algorithms.\r\n\r\nFor further details refer to this link:

They works in model rewriting as well as runtime controlling. Tool can be used in training system as well as in deploy system.\r\n\r\nThis PR add basic part of tool and pruner for all frameworks. The pruner in torch, tvm and tensorrt are tested. Pruner compress the model by given density. It works together with gym(auto optimization system, which will be added in later PRs) to prune the model automatically. It can also works together with distiller (will be added in later PRs) to update weights in pruned model.\r\n\r\nWeightGraph is used in pruning.

functionality to express a call from one `PrimFunc` to another was introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14889.  While this was initially planned to be supported at codegen for all targets (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15835), this resulted in breakage on some backends (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16033). After discussion, the plan was changed to support TIR inlining, which would enable the same high-level functionality in TIR without requiring immediate low-level support across all codegens.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis commit implements and tests a new IRModule transform `InlinePrivateFunctions`, which can be used as part of lowering in a follow-up commit.\r\n\r\nBecause this is initially implemented for use quite late in the lowering flow, many constructs are not currently supported.  The current implementation has the following restrictions.\r\n\r\n* `tir::Block` nodes may not occur in the inlined function.  Because a subroutine may be called multiple times, inlining of a subroutine that contains `tir::Block` would result in non-unique names. Support of subroutines with `tir::Block` instances will require de-duplication of block names.\r\n\r\n* The subroutine's callsite must occur within a `tir::Evaluate` block. Because inlining a subroutine inserts the `tir::Stmt` body at the point of use, replacement must occur in a context where a `tir::Stmt` can be returned.  Support of subroutines that are called within an expression (e.g. Replacing `func` in `Buf[0] = func(1) + func(2)`) would require hoisting preprocessing done in the subroutine to the parent `tir::Stmt`.\r\n\r\n* The subroutine may only accept primitive arguments, and must have an empty `buffer_map`.  Support of subroutines that are called with `tir::Buffer` or `tir::BufferRegion` arguments would require a way to represent these arguments at the callsite, and substitution of the buffer into the callee.\r\n\r\nIf these unsupported constructs are used, then the inlining of those functions is skipped.  This commit includes unit tests for these unsupported constructs, to validate that `InlinePrivateFunctions` produces well-formed output even when they are present.","created_at":"2023-11-29T19:54:41Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T14:00:37Z","closed_at":"2024-01-03T14:00:33Z","merged_at":"2024-01-03T14:00:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"8eec0bff6bdfabd92d41992a0c3b7e0ee0abd857","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/efe7bbd779694ed3c5b2f1ad5d5c815a18215b1c","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tir_inline_private_functions","ref":"tir_inline_private_functions","sha":"efe7bbd779694ed3c5b2f1ad5d5c815a18215b1c","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, `int`, `float`, and `bool` arguments from Python were converted to `IntImm`, `FloatImm`, and `Bool`.  These are subtypes of `PrimExpr`, and should only be used at compile-time.  By automatically applying this conversion as part of the FFI, these types are required to be present whenever a primitive is converted to a `tvm::ObjectRef`.\r\n\r\nThis can become especially fragile for an end-user when storing objects into a TVM container.  Because TVM containers require all contents to be `ObjectRef` subclasses, an automatic conversion may be applied on storing into a container, resulting in an unexpected type being retrieved from the container.  For example, this currently occurs in Relax when extracting a `R.Prim` from a `R.Tuple`.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a `Box<T>` type for storage of boxed primitives at runtime, distinct from the IR types.  This was based on discussion on https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15983, which would have further cemented the `IntImm` type in `libtvm_runtime.so`, rather than starting the process of separating it.\r\n\r\n* Primitive arguments provided to a PackedFunc that requires an `ObjectRef` will be converted to the corresponding boxed type.  (e.g. Passing a Python `int` to a C++ function accepting `ObjectRef` produces a `Box<int64_t>`.\r\n\r\n* Boxed primitives provided to a PackedFunc that requires an unboxed primitive will be converted to the corresponding primitive.\r\n\r\n* PackedFunc return values of `ObjectRef` are converted to the corresponding primitive, if present.  (e.g. If a `tuple_getitem` with static return type `ObjectRef` returns a `Box<int64_t>`, it will be unwrapped to a python `int`.)\r\n\r\nTogether, these three rules provide backwards compatibility for existing PackedFunc definitions, while avoiding exposing the user to any container-induced type conversions betweeen primitive types and `ObjectRef`.","created_at":"2023-11-29T18:00:42Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T19:38:53Z","closed_at":"2024-08-05T13:19:20Z","merged_at":"2024-08-05T13:19:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f22be4d83ca698e316ac342f32f5b4d38155ca8","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4615001219,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABExNUgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/runtime:c++","name":"runtime:c++","color":"B14AD4","default":false,"description":"C++

env：AMD RX 7600\r\nI debugged the MIOpen source code for a specific reason. During the model compilation phase, the Python side calls the conv2d.setup interface, invoking MIOpen's findConvForwardAlgorithm interface to find the appropriate algorithm. Subsequently, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair is registered within the current invokers. Then, without terminating the current process, during the inference stage, the invoker can identify the Algorithm for the corresponding layer-problem and perform direct inference.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the current process is exited and the pre-compiled model is executed without the prior invocation of findConvForwardAlgorithm during the compilation phase, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair won't be registered within the invokers. As a result, the inference stage will report an error stating \"MIOpen Error: No invoker was registered for convolution forward.\"\r\n\r\nBased on the distinction between MIOpen and cuDNN invocation provided by the MIOpen official documentation, the typical sequence for calling Convolution APIs in MIOpen is as follows:\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*GetWorkSpaceSize(): This function returns the workspace size required by the Find() operation.\r\n\r\nmiopenFindConvolution*Algorithm(): This function returns performance information about various algorithms.\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*(): Actual convolution operation.\r\n\r\nThe official documentation emphasizes that calling miopenFindConvolution*Algorithm() is mandatory before using any Convolution API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, according to the documentation found at https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/MIOpen/en/latest/convolution.html#miopenfindconvolutionforwardalgorithm, the last parameter of the miopenFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithm interface, exhaustiveSearch, should be set to 1 (true):\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 0, MIOpen will seek the first kernel with a configuration match. If no configuration match is found, a default configuration will be returned.\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 1, MIOpen will search for the best kernel for the provided configuration. If a match is not found, an exhaustive search is performed by running individual algorithms.\r\n\r\nFor further details refer to this link:

env：AMD RX 7600\r\nI debugged the MIOpen source code for a specific reason. During the model compilation phase, the Python side calls the conv2d.setup interface, invoking MIOpen's findConvForwardAlgorithm interface to find the appropriate algorithm. Subsequently, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair is registered within the current invokers. Then, without terminating the current process, during the inference stage, the invoker can identify the Algorithm for the corresponding layer-problem and perform direct inference.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the current process is exited and the pre-compiled model is executed without the prior invocation of findConvForwardAlgorithm during the compilation phase, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair won't be registered within the invokers. As a result, the inference stage will report an error stating \"MIOpen Error: No invoker was registered for convolution forward.\"\r\n\r\nBased on the distinction between MIOpen and cuDNN invocation provided by the MIOpen official documentation, the typical sequence for calling Convolution APIs in MIOpen is as follows:\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*GetWorkSpaceSize(): This function returns the workspace size required by the Find() operation.\r\n\r\nmiopenFindConvolution*Algorithm(): This function returns performance information about various algorithms.\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*(): Actual convolution operation.\r\n\r\nThe official documentation emphasizes that calling miopenFindConvolution*Algorithm() is mandatory before using any Convolution API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, according to the documentation found at https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/MIOpen/en/latest/convolution.html#miopenfindconvolutionforwardalgorithm, the last parameter of the miopenFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithm interface, exhaustiveSearch, should be set to 1 (true):\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 0, MIOpen will seek the first kernel with a configuration match. If no configuration match is found, a default configuration will be returned.\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 1, MIOpen will search for the best kernel for the provided configuration. If a match is not found, an exhaustive search is performed by running individual algorithms.\r\n\r\nFor further details refer to this link:

env：AMD RX 7600\r\nI debugged the MIOpen source code for a specific reason. During the model compilation phase, the Python side calls the conv2d.setup interface, invoking MIOpen's findConvForwardAlgorithm interface to find the appropriate algorithm. Subsequently, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair is registered within the current invokers. Then, without terminating the current process, during the inference stage, the invoker can identify the Algorithm for the corresponding layer-problem and perform direct inference.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the current process is exited and the pre-compiled model is executed without the prior invocation of findConvForwardAlgorithm during the compilation phase, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair won't be registered within the invokers. As a result, the inference stage will report an error stating \"MIOpen Error: No invoker was registered for convolution forward.\"\r\n\r\nBased on the distinction between MIOpen and cuDNN invocation provided by the MIOpen official documentation, the typical sequence for calling Convolution APIs in MIOpen is as follows:\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*GetWorkSpaceSize(): This function returns the workspace size required by the Find() operation.\r\n\r\nmiopenFindConvolution*Algorithm(): This function returns performance information about various algorithms.\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*(): Actual convolution operation.\r\n\r\nThe official documentation emphasizes that calling miopenFindConvolution*Algorithm() is mandatory before using any Convolution API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, according to the documentation found at https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/MIOpen/en/latest/convolution.html#miopenfindconvolutionforwardalgorithm, the last parameter of the miopenFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithm interface, exhaustiveSearch, should be set to 1 (true):\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 0, MIOpen will seek the first kernel with a configuration match. If no configuration match is found, a default configuration will be returned.\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 1, MIOpen will search for the best kernel for the provided configuration. If a match is not found, an exhaustive search is performed by running individual algorithms.\r\n\r\nFor further details refer to this link:

env：AMD RX 7600\r\nI debugged the MIOpen source code for a specific reason. During the model compilation phase, the Python side calls the conv2d.setup interface, invoking MIOpen's findConvForwardAlgorithm interface to find the appropriate algorithm. Subsequently, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair is registered within the current invokers. Then, without terminating the current process, during the inference stage, the invoker can identify the Algorithm for the corresponding layer-problem and perform direct inference.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the current process is exited and the pre-compiled model is executed without the prior invocation of findConvForwardAlgorithm during the compilation phase, the corresponding <layer-Problem, Algorithm> pair won't be registered within the invokers. As a result, the inference stage will report an error stating \"MIOpen Error: No invoker was registered for convolution forward.\"\r\n\r\nBased on the distinction between MIOpen and cuDNN invocation provided by the MIOpen official documentation, the typical sequence for calling Convolution APIs in MIOpen is as follows:\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*GetWorkSpaceSize(): This function returns the workspace size required by the Find() operation.\r\n\r\nmiopenFindConvolution*Algorithm(): This function returns performance information about various algorithms.\r\n\r\nmiopenConvolution*(): Actual convolution operation.\r\n\r\nThe official documentation emphasizes that calling miopenFindConvolution*Algorithm() is mandatory before using any Convolution API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, according to the documentation found at https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/MIOpen/en/latest/convolution.html#miopenfindconvolutionforwardalgorithm, the last parameter of the miopenFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithm interface, exhaustiveSearch, should be set to 1 (true):\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 0, MIOpen will seek the first kernel with a configuration match. If no configuration match is found, a default configuration will be returned.\r\n\r\nIf exhaustiveSearch == 1, MIOpen will search for the best kernel for the provided configuration. If a match is not found, an exhaustive search is performed by running individual algorithms.\r\n\r\nFor further details refer to this link:

Milestone 2 will be split into some steps:\r\n**M2.1 Add Manager for compile pipeline**\r\nM2.2 Add pruner for model pruning\r\nM2.3 Add tracker for track layer datas\r\nM2.4 Add quantizer for quantize model\r\n\r\nManager can be used as compile pipeline, backend of serving, and the basic for tool chain. The manager controls the compiling via creating runners in different framework and apply different tools. The manager can generate trainable model for optimization as well as finalized model for deploy.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy \r\ncc @junrushao

to this PR, the `TVM_MODULE_VTABLE_*` macros work by detailing the correspondence between the string names and the module methods as part, so that it declares the calling convention of a TVM Module.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the `Execuable` of `RelayVM`, the convention is specified by [link](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/748882aae7be1435f042e22b0fc67cb236705b6c/include/tvm/runtime/vm/executable.h#L60-L76):\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n # Name of the Module\r\nTVM_MODULE_VTABLE_BEGIN(\"VMExecutable\");\r\n # Bind member methods to string name as the calling convention\r\nTVM_MODULE_VTABLE_ENTRY(\"get_lib\", &Executable::GetLib);\r\n...\r\nTVM_MODULE_VTABLE_END();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it supports only \"unpacked\" member methods so far, i.e., ordinary C++ methods with fixed number of arguments, each of which has a compile-type known type, e.g.\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nclass MyModule : public tvm::runtime::Module {\r\n  ...\r\n  int UnpackedMethod(int a, double b, std::string c);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, TVM's calling convention is actually much more powerful and covers the case for variadic arguments and runtime type dynamism via type erasure and tagged union, e.g.\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nclass MyModule : public tvm::runtime::Module {\r\n  ...\r\n  int PackedMethod(TVMArgs args, TVMRetValue* rv);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support for this scenario by a new macro `TVM_MODULE_VTABLE_PACKED`. Example:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nclass MLCServingEngine : public tvm::runtime::Module {\r\n  ...\r\n  TVM_MODULE_VTABLE_BEGIN(\"mlc.serve.engine\");\r\n  TVM_MODULE_VTABLE_ENTRY_PACKED(\"init\", &EngineModule::InitPacked);\r\n  TVM_MODULE_VTABLE_ENTRY(\"add_request\", &EngineModule::AddRequest);\r\n  ...\r\n  TVM_MODULE_VTABLE_END();\r\n\r\n  void InitPacked(TVMArgs args, TVMRetValue* rv) {}\r\n};\r\n```","created_at":"2023-11-18T22:15:41Z","updated_at":"2023-11-19T20:05:04Z","closed_at":"2023-11-19T20:05:04Z","merged_at":"2023-11-19T20:05:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e70c282171c26fe081f3773252143ad687170f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16148/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16148/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16148/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7cf2c6f891a7b95887e444e7eb185f511c8e7b69","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-11-18/module-vtable-enhance","ref":"feature/2023-11-18/module-vtable-enhance","sha":"7cf2c6f891a7b95887e444e7eb185f511c8e7b69","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

PR adds the following member method of `TVMArgs`:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nclass TVMArgs {\r\n public:\r\n  ...\r\n  template <typename T>\r\n  inline T At(int i) const;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method extracts the i-th argument from `TVMArgs`, do proper type checking, and generates proper message if it fails, including the index `i`, expected type and the actual type in the error message.\r\n\r\nPreviously this type checking is more like a more fine-grained approach, which, first in `TVMArgs::operator[](int i)`, checks array boundary and returns `TVMArgValue`, a generic union type of all. Then, `TVMArgValue` has a series overloads of `operator T()` which implicitly prunes it to the desired type.\r\n\r\nThis approach has been proven working consistently well in the past few years, but due to its fine-grained nature, it is impossible for such approach to generate error messages that includes the index `i`. Due to historic constraints, it doesn't generate expected type either.\r\n\r\nThis PR patches this issue, and makes it possible to show full details in the error message.","created_at":"2023-11-18T21:45:35Z","updated_at":"2023-11-19T20:04:50Z","closed_at":"2023-11-19T20:04:50Z","merged_at":"2023-11-19T20:04:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c07f6af431979affb74c0125856976061d62300","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/65c5b1e2e55a0c7c25530aa0aec12ce4f75e13d7","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-11-18/type-checking-in-tvm-args","ref":"feature/2023-11-18/type-checking-in-tvm-args","sha":"65c5b1e2e55a0c7c25530aa0aec12ce4f75e13d7","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open
