The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Adds support for providing `str` schema.\r\n- Add supports for converting `RDDs` of \"atomic\" values, if schema is provided.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it introduces a `TypeVar` representing supported \"atomic\" values. This was done to avoid issue with manual data tests, where the following\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsc.parallelize([1]).toDF(schema=IntegerType())\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: No overload variant of \"toDF\" of \"RDD\" matches argument type \"IntegerType\"  [call-overload]\r\nnote: Possible overload variants:\r\nnote:     def toDF(self, schema: Union[List[str], Tuple[str, ...], None] = ..., sampleRatio: Optional[float] = ...) -> DataFrame\r\nnote:     def toDF(self, schema: Union[StructType, str, None] = ...) -> DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen `Union` type is used (this problem doesn't surface when non-self bound is used).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nType checker only.\r\n\r\nPlease note, that these annotations serve primarily to support documentation, as checks on `self` types are still very limited.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to support reading and writing ANSI intervals from/to CSV datasources.\r\nAith this change, a interval data is written as a literal form like `INTERVAL '1-2' YEAR TO MONTH`.\r\nFor the reading part, we need to specify the schema explicitly like:\r\n```\r\nval readDF = spark.read.schema(\"col INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH\").csv(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better usability. There should be no reason to prohibit from reading/writing ANSI intervals from/to CSV datasources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test. It covers both V1 and V2 sources.","created_at":"2021-09-29T13:29:18Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T18:33:09Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T18:22:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7aba450989bc49a6959bdced87108e2b18cae738","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34142/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34142/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34142/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ceda0fc72255f752ba064b10cd7bfee888fbfc63","head":{"label":"sarutak:ansi-interval-csv-source","ref":"ansi-interval-csv-source","sha":"ceda0fc72255f752ba064b10cd7bfee888fbfc63","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

So it is ok to have outputPath try to overwrite inputpath. In view of this, i think inserting static partition in dynamic partition overwrite mode is also supported, i adjust the judging conditions of `dynamicPartitionOverwrite` to allow this.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to take into account the SQL config `spark.sql.parquet.filterPushdown` while building the array of pushed down filters in v2 `ParquetScanBuilder`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore the changes, `explain()` outputs some filters even filter pushdown to parquet is disabled:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Filter (isnotnull(c0#7) AND (c0#7 = 1))\r\n+- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n   +- BatchScan[c0#7] ParquetScan DataFilters: [isnotnull(c0#7), (c0#7 = 1)], ... PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(c0), EqualTo(c0,1)] RuntimeFilters: []\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIf users parse `explain()`'s output, this PR can influence to them. But in general, it shouldn't. Also, need to highlight that the PR affects DSv2 only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test in `ParquetV2FilterSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to use V2 commands as default as outlined in [SPARK-36588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36588), and this PR migrates `SHOW TABLES` to use v2 command by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands,  and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the user can use v1 command by setting `spark.sql.legacy.useV1Command` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2021-09-29T04:58:42Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T04:33:42Z","closed_at":"2021-10-11T11:28:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8356872fd685524a025ef7e40a3866b5d0e434c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34137/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34137/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34137/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bce9e70f5a14548b19f6c72eb195c83cea0d25bd","head":{"label":"imback82:SPARK-36588-show-tables","ref":"SPARK-36588-show-tables","sha":"bce9e70f5a14548b19f6c72eb195c83cea0d25bd","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInline type hints from `python/pyspark/sql/session.pyi` to `python/pyspark/sql/session.py`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is type hint stub files `python/pyspark/sql/session.pyi` to show the expected types for functions, but we can also take advantage of static type checking within the functions by inlining the type hints.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch simply removes a few `unsupportedOperationCheck` in `TextSocketStreamSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`unsupportedOperationCheck` is used to disable the check of unsupported operations. If we are not to test unsupported operations, it was unnecessarily set in `TextSocketStreamSuite` and could cause unexpected error by missing check.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T21:55:19Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T03:32:04Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T00:45:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4905619d7bd3e295e88274cbd07ea0c46c9a08d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInline type hints from `python/pyspark/sql/functions.pyi` to `python/pyspark/sql/functions.py`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, there is type hint stub files `python/pyspark/sql/functions.pyi` to show the expected types for functions, but we can also take advantage of static type checking within the functions by inlining the type hints.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test.","created_at":"2021-09-28T18:27:07Z","updated_at":"2021-10-05T08:13:28Z","closed_at":"2021-10-05T08:13:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7320c0c8b00cc4e70e0f4c833ae985990aba9735","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a89afca4b66d5412d2327180f96a90686903eb8c","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:inline_functions","ref":"inline_functions","sha":"a89afca4b66d5412d2327180f96a90686903eb8c","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Spark 3.1 and earlier the `network-yarn` module implicitly relies on Guava from `hadoop-client` dependency. This was changed by SPARK-33212 where we moved to shaded Hadoop client which no longer expose the transitive Guava dependency. It stayed fine for a while since we were not using `createDependencyReducedPom` so it picks up the transitive dependency from `spark-network-common` instead. However, things start to break after SPARK-36835 where we restored `createDependencyReducedPom` and now it is no longer able to locate Guava classes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn test -pl common/network-yarn -Phadoop-3.2 -Phive-thriftserver -Pkinesis-asl -Pkubernetes -Pmesos -Pnetlib-lgpl -Pscala-2.12 -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl -Pyarn\r\n...\r\n[INFO] Compiling 1 Java source to /Users/sunchao/git/spark/common/network-yarn/target/scala-2.12/classes ...\r\n[WARNING] [Warn] : bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 8\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/sunchao/git/spark/common/network-yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/yarn/YarnShuffleService.java:32: package com.google.common.annotations does not exist\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/sunchao/git/spark/common/network-yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/yarn/YarnShuffleService.java:33: package com.google.common.base does not exist\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/sunchao/git/spark/common/network-yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/yarn/YarnShuffleService.java:34: package com.google.common.collect does not exist\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/sunchao/git/spark/common/network-yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/yarn/YarnShuffleService.java:118: cannot find symbol\r\n  symbol:   class VisibleForTesting\r\n  location: class org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleService\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds the `INTERNAL_ERROR` error class and the `isInternalError` API to `SparkThrowable`.\r\nRemoves existing error classes that are internal-only and replaces them with `INTERNAL_ERROR`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMakes it easy for end-users to diagnose whether an error is an internal error. If an end-user encounters an internal error, it should be reported immediately. This also limits the number of error classes, making it easy to audit. We do not need high-quality error messages for internal errors, as they should not be exposed to the end-user.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes; this changes the error class in master.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-27T23:12:05Z","updated_at":"2021-10-01T04:46:52Z","closed_at":"2021-10-01T04:46:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b47e493153cab1a90ccc0df6de53e4a48531471","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4844d84f6b7ad50e26db43a627249fd443ed69ad","head":{"label":"karenfeng:internal-error-class","ref":"internal-error-class","sha":"4844d84f6b7ad50e26db43a627249fd443ed69ad","user":{"login":"karenfeng","id":4754931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTQ5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4754931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263201423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMyMDE0MjM=","name":"spark-1","full_name":"karenfeng/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"karenfeng","id":4754931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTQ5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4754931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng/spark-1","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently shuffle mergers are fetched before the start of the ShuffleMapStage. But for initial stages this can be problematic as shuffle mergers are nothing but unique hosts with shuffle services running which could be very few based on executors and this can cause merge ratio to be low. \r\n\r\nWith this approach, `ShuffleMapTask` query for merger locations if not available and if available and start using this for pushing the blocks. Since partitions are mapped uniquely to a merger location, it should be fine to not push for the earlier set of tasks. This should improve the merge ratio for even initial stages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPerformance improvement. No new APIs change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests and also has been working in our internal production environment for a while now.","created_at":"2021-09-27T22:46:32Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T17:26:43Z","closed_at":"2022-02-08T17:25:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"98a0a513f07680d16e53fe22b8277b61a8c6442a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08d8614c57f2f39043257cb926ce0e0082fe65d6","head":{"label":"venkata91:SPARK-34826","ref":"SPARK-34826","sha":"08d8614c57f2f39043257cb926ce0e0082fe65d6","user":{"login":"venkata91","id":8871522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91","html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":170915684,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzA5MTU2ODQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"venkata91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"venkata91","id":8871522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91","html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactor the logic for constructing the user classpath from `yarn.ApplicationMaster` into `yarn.Client` so that it can be leveraged on the executor side as well, instead of having the driver construct it and pass it to the executor via command-line arguments. A new method, `getUserClassPath`, is added to `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` which defaults to `Nil` (consistent with the existing behavior where non-YARN resource managers do not configure the user classpath). `YarnCoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` overrides this to construct the user classpath from the existing `APP_JAR` and `SECONDARY_JARS` configs. Within `yarn.Client`, environment variables in the configured paths are resolved before constructing the classpath.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a re-submission of #32810, which was reverted in #34082 due to the issues described in [this comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35672?focusedCommentId=17419285&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17419285). This PR additionally includes the changes described in #34084 to resolve the issue, though this PR has been enhanced to properly handle escape strings, unlike #34084.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUser-provided JARs are made available to executors using a custom classloader, so they do not appear on the standard Java classpath. Instead, they are passed as a list to the executor which then creates a classloader out of the URLs. Currently in the case of YARN, this list of JARs is crafted by the Driver (in `ExecutorRunnable`), which then passes the information to the executors (`CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend`) by specifying each JAR on the executor command line as `--user-class-path /path/to/myjar.jar`. This can cause extremely long argument lists when there are many JARs, which can cause the OS argument length to be exceeded, typically manifesting as the error message:\r\n\r\n> /bin/bash: Argument list too long\r\n\r\nA [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=spark%20%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%3A%20argument%20list%20too%20long%22&oq=spark%20%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%3A%20argument%20list%20too%20long%22) indicates that this is not a theoretical problem and afflicts real users, including ours. Passing this list using the configurations instead resolves this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThere is one small behavioral change which is a bug fix. Previously the `spark.yarn.config.gatewayPath` and `spark.yarn.config.replacementPath` options were only applied to executors, meaning they would not work for the driver when running in cluster mode. This appears to be a bug; the [documentation for this functionality](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-yarn.html) does not mention any limitations that this is only for executors. This PR fixes that issue.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this fixes the main bash argument length issue, allowing for larger JAR lists to be passed successfully. Configuration of JARs is identical to before, and substitution of environment variables in `spark.jars` or `spark.yarn.config.replacementPath` works as expected.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests were added in `YarnClusterSuite`. Also, we have been running a similar fix internally for 4 months with great success.","created_at":"2021-09-27T20:38:40Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T22:30:10Z","closed_at":"2021-11-16T17:09:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"422868507b6f3bb1466505811ba8ae36e7f4060f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/97540f8f9bb26ba33a93b075e15365b4553834d6","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-35672-yarn-classpath-list-take2","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-35672-yarn-classpath-list-take2","sha":"97540f8f9bb26ba33a93b075e15365b4553834d6","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit aaa0d2a66b6d152f601eafa08c5e17bc087c3a3f.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis approach has 2 disadvantages:\r\n1. It needs to disable `spark.sql.optimizer.dynamicPartitionPruning.reuseBroadcastOnly`.\r\n2. The filtering side will be evaluated 2 times. For example: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29726#issuecomment-780266596\r\n\r\nInstead, we can use bloom filter join pruning in the future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to pushdown filters with ANSI intervals as filter values to the parquet datasource. After the changes, filter values are pushed down with the following values via Filter API:\r\n- `java.time.Period` for year-month filters\r\n- `java.time.Duration` for day-time filters.\r\n\r\nSince at the Parquet filter level, we don't have info about Catalyst's types (`YearMonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType`) but only the info about primitive parquet types `INT32` and `INT64`. As a consequence of that, Spark has to convert filters values \"dynamically\" to `Int`/`Long` while building Parquet filters. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34057 supported ANSI intervals in the Parquet datasource as INT32 (year-month interval) and INT64 (day-time interval) but filters with such values are not pushed down. So, comparing to primitive types, ANSI intervals can suffer from worse performance in read. This PR aims to solve the issue, and achieve feature parity with other types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the changes might influence on performance of the parquet datasource only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests in `ParquetFilterSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt clean \"test:testOnly *ParquetV1FilterSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt clean \"test:testOnly *ParquetV2FilterSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-09-27T13:44:00Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T13:30:08Z","closed_at":"2021-09-28T12:10:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de51de22421edaff3c308d139ec53d909c1bf245","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34115/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34115/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34115/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c640b1fb08ddf0620f9e9d5918f337c5a52fe07f","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:interval-parquet-filter-pushdown","ref":"interval-parquet-filter-pushdown","sha":"c640b1fb08ddf0620f9e9d5918f337c5a52fe07f","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMove `spark.yarn.isHadoopProvided` to Spark parent pom, so that under `resource-managers/yarn` we can make `hadoop-3.2` as the default profile.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently under `resource-managers/yarn` there are 3 maven profiles : `hadoop-provided`, `hadoop-2.7`, and `hadoop-3.2`, of which `hadoop-3.2` is activated by default (via `activeByDefault`). The activation, however, doesn't work when there is other explicitly activated profiles. In specific, if users build Spark with `hadoop-provided`, maven will fail because it can't find Hadoop 3.2 related dependencies, which are defined in the `hadoop-3.2` profile section.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, this proposes to move the `hadoop-provided` section to the parent pom. Currently this is only used to define a property `spark.yarn.isHadoopProvided`, and it shouldn't matter where we define it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested via running the command:\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean package -DskipTests -B -Pmesos -Pyarn -Pkubernetes -Pscala-2.12

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to support writing Hive bucketed table with Hive file formats (the code path for Hive table write - `InsertIntoHiveTable`). The bucketed table is partitioned with Hive hash, same as Hive, Presto and Trino.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make Spark write other-SQL-engines-compatible bucketed table. Same motivation as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33432 .\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Before this PR, writing to these Hive bucketed table would throw an exception in Spark if config \"hive.enforce.bucketing\" or \"hive.enforce.sorting\" set to true. After this PR, writing to these Hive bucketed table would succeed. The table can be read back by Presto and Trino efficiently as other Hive bucketed table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nModified unit test in `BucketedWriteWithHiveSupportSuite.scala`, to verify bucket file names and each row in each bucket is written properly, for Hive write code path as well.","created_at":"2021-09-25T01:00:34Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T18:25:55Z","closed_at":"2021-09-27T07:58:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8dcbf70e76897d813f43090374185a79f46ee32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12a8aca635ac15b1042ded973a244d3872a18c93","head":{"label":"c21:hive-bucket","ref":"hive-bucket","sha":"12a8aca635ac15b1042ded973a244d3872a18c93","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExplicitly specifies error codes when ignoring type hint errors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe use a lot of `type: ignore` annotation to ignore type hint errors in pandas-on-Spark.\r\n\r\nWe should explicitly specify the error codes to make it clear what kind of error is being ignored, then the type hint checker can check more cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

`pyspark/sql/pandas/_typing`.\r\n\r\n- Since the file contains a lot of overloads, we should revisit and manage it separately.\r\n- We can't inline files under `pyspark/sql/pandas/_typing` because it includes new syntax for type hints.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently there are type hint stub files (`*.pyi`) to show the expected types for functions, but we can also take

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix an issue where Maven may stuck in an infinite loop when building Spark, for Hadoop 2.7 profile.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAfter re-enabling `createDependencyReducedPom` for `maven-shade-plugin`, Spark build stopped working for Hadoop 2.7 profile and will stuck in an infinitely loop, likely due to a Maven shade plugin bug similar to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-148. This seems to be caused by the fact that, under `hadoop-2.7` profile, variable `hadoop-client-runtime.artifact` and `hadoop-client-api.artifact`are both `hadoop-client` which triggers the issue.\r\n \r\nAs a workaround, this changes `hadoop-client-runtime.artifact` to be `hadoop-yarn-api` when using `hadoop-2.7`. Since `hadoop-yarn-api` is a dependency of `hadoop-client`, this essentially moves the former to the same level as the latter. It should have no effect as both are dependencies of Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDon't open watch when not needed\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn spark-submit, we currently open a pod watch for any spark submission. If WAIT_FOR_APP_COMPLETION is false, we then immediately ignore the result of the watcher and break out of the watcher.\r\n\r\nWhen submitting spark applications at scale, this is a source of operational pain, since opening the watch relies on opening a websocket, which tends to run into subtle networking issues around negotiating the websocket connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nStandard

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a performance issue in `AppStatusListener.cleanupStages`. When there are large number of stages in store, this logic below runs like N*M order.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val stageIds = stages.map { s =>\r\n      val key = Array(s.info.stageId, s.info.attemptId)\r\n      kvstore.delete(s.getClass(), key)\r\n\r\n      // Check whether there are remaining attempts for the same stage. If there aren't, then\r\n      // also delete the RDD graph data.\r\n      val remainingAttempts = kvstore.view(classOf[StageDataWrapper])\r\n        .index(\"stageId\")\r\n        .first(s.info.stageId)\r\n        .last(s.info.stageId)\r\n        .closeableIterator()\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\nInstead of accessing the view for checking remaining task per stage, this change is to move the logic after removing stages. Then it only needs to access the view(`kvstore.view(classOf[StageDataWrapper])`) once.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen there are more than ideal number of stages kept inside the memory, the clean up process is unable to catch up with the speed of incoming stages because of this perf issue, that leads to a behavior which looks like a memory leak.  Eventually it causes OutOfMemoryError.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe behavior should be identical before and after the change, and the existing tests should verify that. This change has been applied to the environment where constant memory leak was observed. With the same load, now services are running perfectly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA follow up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34054. Three things changed:\r\n1. Add a test for extendable class `ColumnarBatch`\r\n2. Make `ColumnarBatchRow` public.\r\n3. Change private fields to protected fields.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA follow up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34054. Class ColumnarBatch need to be extendable to support better vectorized reading in multiple data sources. For example, Iceberg needs to filter out deleted rows in a batch before Spark consumes it, to support row-level delete( apache/iceberg#3141) in vectorized read.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`sha2(input, bit_length)` returns incorrect results when `bit_length == 224` for all inputs.\r\nThis error can be reproduced by running `spark.sql(\"SELECT sha2('abc', 224)\").show()`, for instance, in spark-shell.\r\n\r\nSpark currently returns \r\n```\r\n#\\t}\"4�\"�B�w��U�*��你���l��\r\n```\r\nwhile the expected result is\r\n```\r\n23097d223405d8228642a477bda255b32aadbce4bda0b3f7e36c9da7\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis appears to happen because the `MessageDigest.digest()` function appears to return bytes intended to be interpreted as a `BigInt` rather than a string. Thus, the output of `MessageDigest.digest()` must first be interpreted as a `BigInt` and then transformed into a hex string rather than directly being interpreted as a hex string.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`sha2(input, bit_length)` with a `bit_length` input of `224` would previously return the incorrect result.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new test to `HashExpressionsSuite.scala` which previously failed and now

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnable `createDependencyReducedPom` for Spark's Maven shaded plugin so that the effective pom won't contain those shaded artifacts such as `org.eclipse.jetty`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the effective pom leaks transitive dependencies to downstream apps for those shaded artifacts, which potentially will cause issues. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI manually tested and the `core/dependency-reduced-pom.xml` no longer contains dependencies such as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd environment variable resolution logic to `yarn.Client.getUserClasspathUrls`, which allows for users to specify JAR paths (e.g. from `spark.jars`) which contain references to environment variables.\r\n\r\nThis is a best-effort attempt to mimic the variable resolution logic used by a typical shell (implemented in `yarn.Client.replaceEnvVars`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn PR #32810 the way user JAR classpaths were passed around was changed to avoid passing them via the command line, which is prone to exceeding maximum argument length limitations. However, as a result, the classpaths are no longer interpreted by the shell, so environment variables are not resolved. This is explicitly called out in the docs of `spark.yarn.config.gatewayPath` as a use case, so we definitely need to continue supporting it. There are more details in the comments of SPARK-36572.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, using environment variables in `spark.jars` or `spark.yarn.config.replacementPath` will work again, as it did before PR #32810.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests added for this specific case in `YarnClusterSuite`.","created_at":"2021-09-23T23:14:15Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T15:55:49Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T15:55:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc0237ac91290aca908ac8d00cd5aa2c49ba0146","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/341a2d31dab85af10208cf9a8947b062ddb05a34","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-35672-yarn-classpath-list","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-35672-yarn-classpath-list","sha":"341a2d31dab85af10208cf9a8947b062ddb05a34","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a check in the optimizer rule `CollapseProject` to avoid combining Project with Aggregate when the project list contains one or more correlated scalar subqueries that reference the output of the aggregate. Combining Project with Aggregate can lead to an invalid plan after correlated subquery rewrite. This is because correlated scalar subqueries' references are used as join conditions, which cannot host aggregate expressions.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```sql\r\nselect (select sum(c2) from t where c1 = cast(s as int)) from (select sum(c2) s from t)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [sum(c2)#10L AS scalarsubquery(s)#11L] <--- Aggregate has neither grouping nor aggregate expressions.\r\n+- Project [sum(c2)#10L]\r\n   +- Join LeftOuter, (c1#2 = cast(sum(c2#3) as int))  <--- Aggregate expression in join condition\r\n      :- LocalRelation [c2#3]\r\n      +- Aggregate [c1#2], [sum(c2#3) AS sum(c2)#10L, c1#2]\r\n         +- LocalRelation [c1#2, c2#3]\r\n\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot generate code for expression: sum(input[0, int, false])\r\n```\r\nCurrently, we only allow a correlated scalar subquery in Aggregate if it is also in the grouping expressions.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/079a9c52925818532b57c9cec1ddd31be723885e/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/subquery.scala#L661-L666\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix an existing optimizer issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: allisonwang-db <allison.wang@databricks.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the 'options' description on `UnresolvedRelation`. This comment was added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29535 but not valid anymore because V1 also uses this `options` (and merge the options with the table properties) per https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29712. \r\n\r\nThis PR can go through from `master` to `branch-3.1`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make `UnresolvedRelation.options`'s description clearer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nScala linter by

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is one of the patches for SPARK-33235: Push-based Shuffle Improvement Tasks.\r\nAdded a class `PushMergeMetrics`, to collect below metrics from shuffle server side for Push-based shuffle:\r\n- no opportunity responses\r\n- too late responses\r\n- pushed bytes written\r\n- cached block bytes\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis helps to understand the push based shuffle metrics from shuffle server side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a method `verifyMetrics` to verify those metrics in existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nLead-authored by: Chandni Singh

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded new hint `OPTIONS` to support sql table-level options.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow a DataFrame API user can implement dynamic options through the DataFrameReader$option method, but Spark SQL users cannot use.\r\n ```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.SupportsRead$newScanBuilder\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.SupportsWrite$newWriteBuilder\r\n```\r\nThe table options were persisted to the Catalog and if we want to modify that, we should use another DDL like \"ALTER TABLE ...\". But there are some cases that user want to modify the table options dynamically just in the query:\r\n- Take JDBCTable as an example to implement table-level options\r\n```\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM jdbc_catalog.db.table1 /*+ OPTIONS('lowerBound'='1', upperBound='10', numPartitions='5') */ t1\r\n\tJOIN jdbc_catalog.db.table2 /*+ OPTIONS('lowerBound'='100', upperBound='1000', numPartitions='10') */ t2\r\n\tON t1.col1 = t2.col1\r\n```\r\n~~- IcebergTable support time travel~~\r\n\r\nThese parameters setting is very common and ad-hoc, setting them flexibly would promote the user experience with Spark SQL especially for Now we support catalog expansion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n##### OPTIONS Hints\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM jdbc_catalog.db.table /*+ OPTIONS('lowerBound'='1', upperBound='10', numPartitions='5') */\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded Unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor the join if one side is small and other side is large, the shuffle overhead is also very big. Due to the\r\nbhj limitation, we can only broadcast right side for left join and left side for right join. So for the other case, we can try to use `BroadcastNestedLoopJoin` as the join strategy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, new hint\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd new test in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAt the moment, parquet-mr uses LZ4 compression codec provided by Hadoop, and only since HADOOP-17292 (in 3.3.1/3.4.0) the latter added `lz4-java` to remove the restriction that the codec can only be run with native library. As consequence, the test will fail when using `hadoop-2.7` profile.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's just test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDisable tests related to LZ4 in `FileSourceCodecSuite`, `FileSuite` and `ParquetCompressionCodecPrecedenceSuite` when using `hadoop-2.7` profile.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAt the moment, parquet-mr uses LZ4 compression codec provided by Hadoop, and only since HADOOP-17292 (in 3.3.1/3.4.0) the latter added `lz4-java` to remove the restriction that the codec can only be run with native library. As consequence, the test will fail when using `hadoop-2.7` profile.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's just test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix `pop` of Categorical Series to be consistent with the latest pandas (1.3.2) behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34052.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs https://github.com/databricks/koalas/issues/2198, pandas API on Spark behaves differently from pandas on `pop` of Categorical Series.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, results of `pop` of Categorical Series change.\r\n\r\n#### From\r\n```py\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"a\"], dtype=\"category\")\r\n>>> psser\r\n0    a                                                                          \r\n1    b\r\n2    c\r\n3    a\r\ndtype:

In case the filtering predicate on dimension table is on joinKey, no need to insert DPP filter in that case.\r\n\r\nSample query:\r\n```\r\nSELECT f.date_id, f.pid, f.sid FROM\r\n(select date_id, product_id as pid, store_id as sid from fact_stats) as f\r\nJOIN dim_stats s\r\nON f.sid = s.store_id WHERE s.store_id = 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout this PR DPP filter is inserted for above query despite of `store_id#4551 = 3` on fact_stats\r\n```\r\n  == Physical Plan ==\r\n  *(2) Project [date_id#4548, pid#4631, sid#4632]\r\n  +- *(2) BroadcastHashJoin [sid#4632], [store_id#4552], Inner, BuildRight, false\r\n     :- *(2) Project [date_id#4548, product_id#4549 AS pid#4631, store_id#4551 AS sid#4632]\r\n     :  +- *(2) ColumnarToRow\r\n     :     +- FileScan parquet default.fact_stats[date_id#4548,product_id#4549,store_id#4551] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/D:/workspace/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql..., PartitionFilters: [(store_id#4551 = 3), isnotnull(store_id#4551), **dynamicpruningexpression(store_id#4551 IN dynamic...,** PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<date_id:int,product_id:int>\r\n     :           +- SubqueryBroadcast dynamicpruning#4636, 0, [store_id#4552], [id=#2461]\r\n     :              +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(cast(input[0, int, false] as bigint)),false), [id=#2460]\r\n     :                 +- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(store_id#4552) AND (store_id#4552 = 3))\r\n     :                    +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n     :                       +- FileScan parquet default.dim_stats[store_id#4552] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(store_id#4552), (store_id#4552 = 3)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/D:/workspace/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(store_id), EqualTo(store_id,3)], ReadSchema: struct<store_id:int>\r\n     +- ReusedExchange [store_id#4552], BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(cast(input[0, int, false] as bigint)),false), [id=#2460]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHaving redundant dynamic filters can have  unnecessary overheads: extra filtering overhead + in case of DPP subquery case, subquery execution overhead.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove `com.github.rdblue:brotli-codec:0.1.1` dependency.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs Stephen Coy pointed out in the dev list, we should not have `com.github.rdblue:brotli-codec:0.1.1` dependency which is not available on Maven Central. This is to avoid possible artifact changes on `Jitpack.io`.\r\nAlso, the dependency is for tests only. I suggest that we remove it now to unblock the 3.2.0 release ASAP.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nGA tests.","created_at":"2021-09-21T15:09:18Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T01:02:48Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T17:57:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18b6175aa9615e450c6614d94bce475bcc2957a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34059/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34059/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34059/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eaeba81aa6a2895673b614c9aebf02bf79c4a66b","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:removeDeps","ref":"removeDeps","sha":"eaeba81aa6a2895673b614c9aebf02bf79c4a66b","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAllow saving and loading of ANSI intervals - `YearMonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType` to/from the Parquet datasource. After the changes, Spark saves ANSI intervals as primitive physical Parquet types:\r\n- year-month intervals as `INT32`\r\n- day-time intervals as `INT64`\r\n\r\nw/o any modifications. To load the values as intervals back, Spark puts the info about interval types to the extra key `org.apache.spark.sql.parquet.row.metadata`:\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar parquet-tools-1.12.0.jar meta ./part-...-c000.snappy.parquet\r\n\r\ncreator:     parquet-mr version 1.12.1 (build 2a5c06c58fa987f85aa22170be14d927d5ff6e7d)\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.version = 3.3.0\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.sql.parquet.row.metadata = {\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[...,{\"name\":\"i\",\"type\":\"interval year to month\",\"nullable\":false,\"metadata\":{}}]}\r\n\r\nfile schema: spark_schema\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n...\r\ni:           REQUIRED INT32 R:0 D:0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** The given PR focus on support of ANSI intervals in the Parquet datasource via write or read as a column in `Dataset`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. At the moment, users can make ANSI intervals \"inside\" Spark or parallelize Java collections of `Period`/`Duration` objects but cannot save the intervals to any built-in datasources. After the changes, users can save datasets/dataframes with year-month/day-time intervals to load them back later by Apache Spark.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select date'today' - date'2021-01-01' as diff\").write.parquet(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/parquet_interval\")\r\n\r\nscala> val readback = spark.read.parquet(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/parquet_interval\")\r\nreadback: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [diff: interval day]\r\n\r\nscala> readback.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- diff: interval day (nullable = true)\r\n\r\nscala> readback.show\r\n+------------------+\r\n|              diff|\r\n+------------------+\r\n|INTERVAL '264' DAY|\r\n+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn some sense, yes. Before the changes, users get an error while saving of ANSI intervals as dataframe columns to parquet files but the operation should complete successfully after the changes. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By running the existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetFileFormatV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *FileBasedDataSourceSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *JsonV2Suite\"\r\n```\r\n2. Added new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *ParquetIOSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *ParquetSchemaSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-09-21T14:23:57Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T06:55:22Z","closed_at":"2021-09-24T06:55:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd8be8c2d286c699163f4b750d38f2219df4be97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34057/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34057/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34057/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/32f4eb968cac317f8c33b4467b11c9fbd4636c68","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:ansi-interval-save-parquet","ref":"ansi-interval-save-parquet","sha":"32f4eb968cac317f8c33b4467b11c9fbd4636c68","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

In this case the result is the bitwise operation that the function supports, and the byte length of the resulting byte sequence is equal to the common byte length of the two inputs.\r\n* In the three-argument case, the third argument determines how the operation is performed in the case of byte sequences with unequal lengths. The third argument must be equal to either `lpad` or `rpad` (equality here is case insensitive), otherwise an exception is thrown. More precisely, if the third argument is equal to `lpad`, the shorter byte sequence is conceptually left-padded with zeros to match the length of the longer byte sequence, whereas if the third argument is `rpad`, the shorter byte sequence is conceptually right-padded with zeros to match the length of the longer sequence. Obviously, if the two input byte sequences are of the same length the result is the same for both values of the third argument, and equal to what the two-argument version of the function would have produced. In all cases, the byte length of the result is equal to the maximum of the byte lengths of the two input byte sequences.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n* Equal length inputs, two argument overload, `bitand` function:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitand(unhex('aabb'), unhex('03e3'))\").show\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n|bitand(unhex(aabb), unhex(03e3), lpad)|\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n|                               [02 A3]|\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n* Equal length inputs, three argument overload, `bitand` function:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitand(unhex('aabb'), unhex('03e3'), 'lpad')\").show\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n|bitand(unhex(aabb), unhex(03e3), lpad)|\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n|                               [02 A3]|\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitand(unhex('aabb'), unhex('03e3'), 'rpad')\").show\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n|bitand(unhex(aabb), unhex(03e3), rpad)|\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n|                               [02 A3]|\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n* Unequal length inputs, three argument overload, `bitand` function:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitand(unhex('aabb'), unhex('13e3ff'), 'lpad')\").show\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|bitand(unhex(aabb), unhex(13e3ff), lpad)|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|                              [00 A2 BB]|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitand(unhex('aabb'), unhex('13e3ff'), 'rpad')\").show\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|bitand(unhex(aabb), unhex(13e3ff), rpad)|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|                              [02 A3 00]|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n* Unequal length inputs, three argument overload, `bitor` function:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitor(unhex('aabb'), unhex('13e3ff'), 'lpad')\").show\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n|bitor(unhex(aabb), unhex(13e3ff), lpad)|\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n|                             [13 EB FF]|\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitor(unhex('aabb'), unhex('13e3ff'), 'rpad')\").show\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n|bitor(unhex(aabb), unhex(13e3ff), rpad)|\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n|                             [BB FB FF]|\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n* Unequal length inputs, three argument overload, `bitxor` function:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitxor(unhex('aabb'), unhex('13e3ff'), 'lpad')\").show\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|bitxor(unhex(aabb), unhex(13e3ff), lpad)|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|                              [13 49 44]|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select bitxor(unhex('aabb'), unhex('13e3ff'), 'rpad')\").show\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|bitxor(unhex(aabb), unhex(13e3ff), rpad)|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|                              [B9 58 FF]|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese functions are useful for performing bitwise operations on `BINARY` values, seen as bit sets.\r\n\r\nOther databases offer similar or the same functionality. In more detail:\r\n* Teradata supports them as [functions](https://docs.teradata.com/r/kmuOwjp1zEYg98JsB8fu_A/zNvtiufFYVtAA~wqxccYKA).\r\n* Postgres supports them as [operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-bitstring.html) over the `BIT` data type with the restriction that the inputs must be of equal length.\r\n* MySQL supports them as [operators](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/bit-functions.html). Arguments must have the same length.\r\n* SQL Server supports them as [operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/bitwise-operators-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15), but only one of the two arguments can be a binary string.\r\n\r\nOracle, Snowflake, Hive SQL, Big Query do not support the proposed functions for binary strings, but rather only for integral types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Four new SQL functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to improve simplifications of `EqualTo/EqualNullSafe` binary comparators when one side is a boolean literal.\r\nFor example: `EqualTo(predicate, TrueLiteral) => predicate`, `EqualNullSafe(predicate, TrueLiteral) => predicate if !predicate.nullable`\r\nThis PR helps pushing down the filter and reducing unnecessary IO.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe following query does not push down the filter in the current implementation\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE (a AND b) = true\r\n```\r\nalthough the following equivalent query pushes down the filter as expected.\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE (a AND b)\r\n```\r\nThat is because the first query creates `EqualTo(And(a, b), TrueLiteral)` that is simply not in the form that we can push down. However, we should be able to get it simplified to `And(a, b)`\r\nIt is fair for Spark SQL users to expect `(a AND b) = true` performs the same as `(a AND b)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"testOnly *BooleanSimplificationSuite  -- -z

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange class ColumnarBatch to a non-final class\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support better vectorized reading in multiple data source, ColumnarBatch need to be extendable. For example, To support row-level delete(  https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3141) in Iceberg's vectorized read, we need to filter out deleted rows in a batch, which requires ColumnarBatch to be extendable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProposes an infrastructure for as-of join and implements `ps.merge_asof` here.\r\n\r\n1. Introduce `AsOfJoin` logical plan\r\n2. Rewrite the plan in the optimize phase:\r\n\r\n- From something like (SQL syntax is not determied):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM left ASOF JOIN right ON (condition, as_of on(left.t, right.t), tolerance)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- To\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT left.*, __right__.*\r\nFROM (\r\n     SELECT\r\n          left.*,\r\n          (\r\n               SELECT MIN_BY(STRUCT(right.*), left.t - right.t) AS __nearest_right__\r\n               FROM right\r\n               WHERE condition AND left.t >= right.t AND right.t >= left.t - tolerance\r\n          ) as __right__\r\n     FROM left\r\n     )\r\nWHERE __right__ IS NOT NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. The rewritten scalar-subquery will be handled by the existing decorrelation framework.\r\n\r\nNote: APIs on SQL DataFrames and SQL syntax are TBD (e.g., [SPARK-22947](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22947)), although there are temporary APIs added here.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPandas' `merge_asof` or as-of join for SQL/DataFrame is useful for time series analysis.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. `ps.merge_asof` can be used.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> quotes\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to remove broadcast variable in `InSubqueryExec` which is used in DPP.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we include a broadcast variable in `InSubqueryExec`. We use it to hold filtering side query result of DPP. It looks weird because we don't use the result in executors but only need the result in the driver during query planning. We already hold the original result, so basically we hold two copied of query result at this moment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting
