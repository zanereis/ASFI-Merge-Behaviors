The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.10 - 05 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1629\">#1629</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.9 - 27 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning.

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.0 - 21 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1649\">#1649</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.8.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1618\">#1618</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.12 - 13 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the value of the <code>GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT</code> environment variable in the telemetry sent to GitHub. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically\">default setup</a>. The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.10 - 05 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1629\">#1629</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.9 - 27 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1585\">#1585</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.7 - 15 Mar 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.6 - 10 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1561\">#1561</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.5 - 24 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a

setup</a>. The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.10 - 05 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1629\">#1629</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.9 - 27 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1585\">#1585</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.7 - 15 Mar 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.6 - 10 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1561\">#1561</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.5 - 24 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.4 - 10 Feb 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3 - 08 Feb 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

<code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1585\">#1585</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.7 - 15 Mar 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.6 - 10 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1561\">#1561</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.5 - 24 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.4 - 10 Feb 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3 - 08 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1518\">#1518</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.9 - 27 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1585\">#1585</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.7 - 15 Mar 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.6 - 10 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1561\">#1561</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.5 - 24 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.4 - 10 Feb 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3 - 08 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1518\">#1518</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.8 - 22 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1585\">#1585</a></li>\n<li>Customers post-processing the SARIF output of the <code>analyze</code> Action before uploading it to Code Scanning will benefit from an improved debugging experience. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1598\">#1598</a>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action will now upload a SARIF file with debugging information to Code Scanning on failed runs for customers using <code>upload: false</code>. Previously, this was only available for customers using the default value of the <code>upload</code> input.</li>\n<li>The <code>upload</code> input to the <code>analyze</code> Action now accepts the following values:\n<ul>\n<li><code>always</code> is the default value, which uploads the SARIF file to Code Scanning for successful and failed runs.</li>\n<li><code>failure-only</code> is recommended for customers post-processing the SARIF file before uploading it to Code Scanning. This option uploads debugging information to Code Scanning for failed runs to improve the debugging experience.</li>\n<li><code>never</code> avoids uploading the SARIF file to Code Scanning even if the code scanning run fails. This is not recommended for external users since it complicates debugging.</li>\n<li>The legacy <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> options will be interpreted as <code>always</code> and <code>failure-only</code> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.7 - 15 Mar 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.6 - 10 Mar 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1561\">#1561</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.5 - 24 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.4 - 10 Feb 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3 - 08 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1518\">#1518</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

The first version 6.0.0 was released in December 2017.\nOver the course of more than 5 years we published almost every month a new minor version of PMD 6\nwith new features and improvements.</p>\n<p>Already in November 2018 we started in parallel the development of the next major version 7.0.0,\nand we are now in the process of finalizing the scope of the major version.

`cxf.maven.core.version` from 3.6.3 to 3.9.1.\nUpdates `maven-compat` from 3.6.3 to 3.9.1\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/maven/releases\">maven-compat's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>3.9.1</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.1/release-notes.html\">Release Notes - Maven - Version 3.9.1\n</a></h2>\n<h2>Overview About the Changes</h2>\n<p>Regression fixes from Maven 3.9.0. General performance and other fixes.</p>\n<h2>Potentially Breaking Core Changes (if migrating from 3.8.x)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Maven Resolver transport has changed from Wagon to “native HTTP”, see <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-resolver-transport.html\">Resolver Transport guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maven 2.x was auto-injecting an ancient version of plexus-utils dependency into the plugin classpath, and Maven 3.x continued doing this to preserve backward compatibility. Starting with Maven 3.9, it does not happen anymore. This change may lead to plugin breakage. The fix for affected plugin maintainers is to explicitly declare a dependency on plexus-utils. The workaround for affected plugin users is to add this dependency to plugin dependencies until issue is fixed by the affected plugin maintainer. See <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6965\">MNG-6965</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mojos are prevented to boostrap new instance of RepositorySystem (for example by using deprecated ServiceLocator), they should reuse RepositorySystem instance provided by Maven instead.

the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of

these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs.

2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF.
