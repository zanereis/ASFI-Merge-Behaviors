Doesn't actually fix the errors, but at least now users won't see them.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nChecked whether `stop_query` worked as expected locally. Threw some fake exceptions to make sure retries still worked.\r\n\r\nConfirmed that `stop_query` works whether or not a celery worker is available.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@graceguo-supercat @etr2460

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nImplementing my old TODO :) This PR implements better support for the schema access permissions, e.g. enables users to use sql lab and view slices, tables in the view models.\r\nIn order to achieve that schema_perm will be serialized in DB along side with perm and will be updated on the model changes. It will allows us to continue using filters in the model views.\r\n\r\nNote: moved changes from https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8189 to this diff to have more holistic view on the approach.\r\nPartially fixes: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8081\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* added support for schema permission for tables, datasources, slices and sqllab\r\n* large performance improvements for the permission checks involving schema checks ( schema list endpoint latency is down from ~50 secs to ~ 2 seconds for user that has ~ 3 k schema permissions for the DB with 10k schemas and ~20-30 k tables )\r\n* unified view_menu lookup code and removed some code duplication\r\n* added unit tests for permissions code [ some parts of it had no unit tests before ] \r\n* small bug fixes:\r\n** creating permissions for the druid clusters\r\n** proper database permission name \r\n** schema permission checks in model views\r\n** schema api does schema filtering rather than returning schema's from found permissions\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n[X] added unit tests\r\n[X] tested locally \r\n[X] tested on dbx prod and staging instances, caveat is that we are ramping up the project and have small number of users\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [X] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [X] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [X] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.

My intuition is that `.focus().blur()` is needed to insure that the store gets updated. With redux getting save to local storage onChange, it takes some millisecs to save that payload, so we prevent updating the store as it makes typing SQL laggy, and only commit to the store on blur.\r\n\r\nGuessing there's a timing issue where blur may not occur in time, so trying to be explicit about it. For reference, other tests were doing this more explicitly before, so extending the approach to all tests touching Ace editor.\r\n\r\n🤞 🤞 🤞 \r\n\r\n@dpgaspar

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn SQL Lab, to distinguish between tables and views we prefix the latter with the string `[view]`, which looks ugly. I changed it to display a small icon representing the type — either a table for actual tables, or an eye for views.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we don't present any information on views. I added a link to show the actual `CREATE VIEW` statement that defines a given view.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1698\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-10 at 1 53 44 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/64650175-6d7d5000-d3d3-11e9-99b1-99e366ffaf63.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1698\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-10 at 1 54 03 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/64650180-70784080-d3d3-11e9-974b-48712a0a1000.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1698\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-10 at 1 54 09 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/64650185-72da9a80-d3d3-11e9-8e15-bc1236c40f76.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nCurrently most DB engine specs seem to return views as tables, due to limitations in the SQL Alchemy driver. Both Presto and SQLlite return no views, bundling the views with the actual tables. I had to mock the response from the engines to generate the screenshots.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to write a PR for Presto next, allowing views to be properly displayed. This might require changes upstream (to https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive), though it's possible to work around it in Superset only.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [X] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB

early community contribution added the concept of restricted metrics.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to allow for some metrics to be restricted, and if a metric\r\nwas tagged as such, a user would need to be given access to that metric\r\nmore explicitely, through a special perm we would maintain for that\r\nmetric.\r\n\r\nNow since the new concept of \"Adhoc Metrics\", the popover that lets a\r\nuser pick a column and an aggregate function or to write their own SQL\r\nexpression inline, this restriction is completely bypassed. Adhoc\r\nmetrics was developed without the restricted metrics in mind.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, in the near future, we'll be rethinking the ideas behind\r\ndata-access permissions, and things like column-level or row-level\r\nsecurity will be redesigned from scratch.\r\n\r\nBy deprecating this feature, we're removing a confusing and mostly broken\r\nfeature, and making it easy to move forward\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-09T05:02:21Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:39:34Z","closed_at":"2019-09-10T00:20:33Z","merged_at":"2019-09-10T00:20:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d4b955cc7c2dd68e4a5e32aa369554486f84acb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"🏷️

then be killed to protect Presto from duplicate queries.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nConfig was tested and async queries still work as before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the orderby element is passed as a string when constructing the `Selectable` in `sqla/models.py`. This gets automatically replaced by the corresponding native `ColumnClause` if a column with the same name exists in the `SELECT` columns. However, if the orderable column is not present in the `SELECT`, an exception is thrown. This PR makes the orderable column a native SqlAlchemy construct, avoiding the need for including the orderable in the select columns.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested locally.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\n~~For both the Druid and SQLA connectors metrics can be restricted (via the `metric_access` permission) however there were not really any security checks associated with this. For the Druid connector there was a check to see if restricted metrics were being used at query time (though this can be pushed higher in the stack to the views given that the Druid REST API doesn't support SQL).~~ \r\n\r\n~~I realize that with the advent of ad-hoc metrics the notion of restricted metrics is probably somewhat obsolete~~ but there seems to be merit in having the security manager be _more_ context aware from a permission standpoint for the `explore_json`, `slice_json`, or `v1/query` routes where rather than checking whether the user has access to the datasource the check should be at the visualization or query context level (higher fidelity). \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a couple of more context aware (higher fidelity) public methods to the security manager: \r\n\r\n- `assert_query_context_permission` \r\n- `assert_viz_permission`\r\n\r\nreplacing calls to `assert_datasource_permission` where appropriate. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [X] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe currently added to Presto support for estimating the number of bytes scanned (https://github.com/prestosql/presto/pull/806), and we'd like to surface that information to SQL Lab users before they actually run a query.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the DB specs with an `allows_cost_estimate` attribute and associated methods, allowing pre-execution costs to be computed from DBs that support it.\r\n\r\nIn order to use it, the feature flag `ESTIMATE_QUERY_COST` must be enabled, and it needs to be explicitly turned on for each database that supports query cost estimation. When all those conditions are met, a new button will show up in SQL Lab, allowing users to run cost estimates for the whole query or for the selected SQL.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nDBs where the feature is not supported or not enabled are unmodified:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1698\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-04 at 8 48 46

-->\r\n\r\nTested with a Presto cluster that supports query cost estimation, running version 0.319 and with the feature enabled via extra:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.319\",\r\n    \"cost_estimate_enabled\": true,\r\n    \"metadata_params\": {},\r\n    \"engine_params\": {\r\n       \"connect_args\": {\r\n           \"protocol\":\"https\", \r\n           \"source\":\"superset\"\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    \"metadata_cache_timeout\": {\"schema_cache_timeout\": 86400, \"table_cache_timeout\": 86400},\r\n    \"default_schemas\": [\"core\", \"default\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I tested:\r\n\r\n- Lowering the Presto version removes the button.\r\n- Other DBs don't show the button.\r\n- Turning off the feature flag removes the button.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [X] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [X] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis is part of dashboard filter indicator design:\r\n- when user clicks on indicator, dashboard will navigate to the actual filter_box (done in #7908)\r\n- when user open options on a filter_box, the indicators in applicable charts should show up. (thanks for upgrade in #8115 ). See demo below:\r\n\r\n![AaGV6NPaiz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/64225323-c313a300-ce8f-11e9-84a6-321db6809681.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixed a couple of issue after #7908 is released:\r\n\r\n1. To keep filter name in single line: show ellipsis for long filter name in tooltip. Still show full content for filter options values.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"336\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-01 at 12 14 45 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/64224388-1dab0000-ce8c-11e9-9a8c-fc31fd0973cb.png\">\r\n\r\n2. Show color bar when filter has a selected value(s):\r\n\r\n![M8LjqqgdJ7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/64225061-aa56bd80-ce8e-11e9-9fdc-be8f72732b9f.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. when user clicks filter indicator, we used to outline the filter_box. This outline will draw user attention, but after user worked on other area in the dashboard, I feel it is a little annoying with outline still on the old filter_box. So in this PR i make the outline only on about 2 seconds, and will turn off by itself.\r\n\r\n![hdcxRjNg5d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/64225278-8e9fe700-ce8f-11e9-9ec1-af8044da7c58.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCustom timegrains defined in `superset_config.py` stopped working somewhere between 0.32 and 0.34. This fixes the regression, removes an unnecessary private function and renames some functions and variables to more clearly indicate what is public and private. The tests were also lacking, as they only tested private methods, not the actual end result of making changes to the config file. Now both blacklisted and addon grains are tested properly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal testing +

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently docker entrypoint is a bash script.\r\n`docker stop` command (or restart in kubernetes) sends SIGTERM to the\r\ncontainer but it isn't catched by gunicorn.\r\nSo gunicorn can't start graceful shutdown which may lead to killing\r\nuser's connection and also adds 10s (default value) delay for stopping\r\nuntil docker sends SIGKILL.\r\nUsing `exec` replaces the shell with the process being opened and\r\nsignals are propagated correctly.\r\n\r\nRef: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/\r\nRef: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/146756/forward-sigterm-to-child-in-bash\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nRun superset in docker container and execute `docker stop` on master it would result in:\r\n1. 10s delay before stopping\r\n2. Exit code 137 (means gunicorn was killed)\r\n\r\nRun superset in docker container and execute `docker stop` from this branch it would result in: \r\n1. Quick exit (~1s)\r\n2. Correct exit code 0\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

`superset/assets/spec`.\r\n\r\nHowever, we still have a decent number of dependencies that we'll need to update prior to being able to use React 17. This can be pushed off for a while (because React 17 isn't even out yet), but at some point, we'll have to pay the piper and upgrade a bunch of stuff. This'll include (I think) moving to a newer version of Bootstrap and finding a new React virtualizable library, as well as a bunch of other changes. No actions needed yet, but we'll wanna keep this on the future radar.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nEnsure dashboards, charts, and SQL Lab still work as expected.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nUsed `backoff` module to add retries for `stop_query`, which was having issues related to lock timeouts and rollbacks. Also reworked `get_query` to use `backoff` as well.\r\n\r\n`get_query` behavior is the same as before.\r\n\r\n`stop_query` attempts to stop the query five times. If, during the process of stopping, the query completes, it will not set the status of the query to stop. If it fails all 5 retries, it will throw an error (probably the same lock timeout error, but without the stuff about rollbacks because there are now rollbacks).\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\ntox passes. `stop_query` works as expected locally, but it's hard to reproduce this error, so I can't really tell if it errors less.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@graceguo-supercat

Fun stuff. I left a few of the more confusing methods untyped.\r\n\r\nPossible issues:\r\n* Occasionally treating sqlalchemy `Column`s as their corresponding python types.\r\n* `# noqa` in a number of places. Mostly issues with dicts and missing return statements.\r\n\r\nAlso rewrote a few lines here and there to be more ~~~pythonic~~~.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\ntox passes for py36 and flake8.\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCustom Security Manager appeared to be broken when behind an AWS ALB, but when I dug further, the Werkzeug version was bumped.  This caused an invalid configuration for the proxy in that the host was not passed on.  Because of this, along with the change of the library path, and the inclusion of the additional library bump in accordance with https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5571, I have validated that the regression that prevented CSM from working in v0.33.0rc1 -> v0.34.0rc [1 & 2] has been resolved.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nI deployed internally the fix, and validated that the port is not being returned in the header for the destination after hitting the root IP of the Superset instance.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

Currently, the setting is not persisted, since in the cases we observed the use was more circumstantial.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![sqllab_resize_width](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/63601911-34dc1a80-c57b-11e9-93bf-7e4da404bd92.gif)\r\n\r\nNote that the gutter is not vertically centered, which I found more intuitive. I can move it to the center.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nSee video above.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen the Presto db engine spec was changed to support multiple partition columns, it broke Hive because it extends Presto. Table previews and copy select star broke because they wouldn't add partition filters. This PR updates the functions that the Hive spec extends to return and accept the same data types\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- Test copy select statement and ensure it has a partition\r\n- Test table preview\r\n- Test jinja latest partition function\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen a user tries to stop a query, very occasionally, the action fails and the query still runs to completion. The issue isn't user-facing, but errors in the backend show that there is some kind of lock wait timeout issue.\r\n\r\nUnknown if it is possible to completely prevent these, and the issue isn't really user-facing, but I added some tweaks to hopefully prevent a few of these conflicts.\r\n* Add `commit()` after setting the initial query status to `RUNNING`\r\n* Check if the query has stopped before running each statement. Exit if query has stopped.\r\n* (Unrelated) Removed line 281 which (afaik) doesn't do anything\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nTox passes.\r\n\r\nI didn't write a test because it is pretty hard to reproduce this error - seems like a rare timing thing. These changes are mostly for safety and shouldn't affect behavior of anything.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@etr2460

Justin McLean's feedback:\r\n```\r\nLiCENSE is missing:\r\n- This BSD licensed file [1] The file also has an incorrectly has an ASF header on it.\r\n- This file in not mentioned [2] and I think is licensed like so [3] If so that may be problematic [4]. However I seem to recall this was discussed before so there may of been some conclusion about it? I also note that .*geojson are explicitly listed in your rat excludes so I assume there a reason for that. (Comments in the rat exclusion file could help here).\r\n- This file [5] looks to contain the Monokai theme from [6] I’m unsure how this is licensed. The pro version seems to require a commercial license. It might of come from here [7]? which is MIT licensed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJustin\r\n\r\n1. ./superset/extract_table_names.py\r\n2 ./assets/src/visualizations/CountryMap/countries/india.geojson\r\n3.

Each step has is simply a bar graph step with a specific query. Relationships are made between each step by printing the delta for story telling effect.\r\n![Steps](https://i.imgur.com/z6dCtj1.png)\r\n\r\n2) ABSOLUTE FILTER\r\nAbsolute Filter can be added on a slice as a whole for repetitive filters. For example if you are only interested in telling a story on domestic sales. You can apply the domestic_sales filter once in absolute filter instead of on every step.\r\n![Absolute Filter](https://i.imgur.com/Oth7I10.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nRun additional tests on the

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the deck.gl Polygon layer only accepts JSON coordinate arrays, polyline, or geohashes as data inputs. This requires user's to perform substantial pre-processing on their data if their data source stores geometry objects as GeoJSON. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds GeoJSON encoding support to the deck.gl polygon chart. It will automatically determine if the user supplied polygon data is a GeoJSON (either single or multi-polygon) or a simple JSON coordinate array. All existing charts using JSON coordinate arrays should be unaffected by this change.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrent incarnation of \"event logger\" is an \"abstract base class\", but in practice its usefulness is tightly coupled to the DBEventLogger implementation, which in turn is tightly coupled to a mandatory db migration ('logs' table). The base class itself has a completely untyped interface (args and kwargs), but the `DBEventLogger` impl relies on very specific (but not codified-via-interface) kwargs to be in the incoming messages.  Those kwargs are put there by the `log_this` decorator which is scattered across the codebase, which means that if you have DBEventLogger configured you can't actually use this AbstractEventLogger outside of the `log_this` decorator unless you know the specific schema that the DBEventLogger expects to find in the untyped args and kwargs data it receives (which are very request-logging specific fields).\r\n\r\nThis change is a first step to move logging towards a standard logging based approach with clearer data types with crisp responsibilities surrounding the logging of various event types, and brings the following changes:\r\n- all incoming events are logged to a configured `superset_events` logger\r\n- `log_this` is renamed to `log_requests` to more clearly document what it is passing and persisting to the `DBEventLogger`, and now is logging an event through event logger prior to sending to `DBEventLogger`\r\n- `LoggingConfigurator` is added to allow local installations to configure a custom handler for events\r\n- query logger is now logging a `query` event to to event logger prior to calling the configured query logger\r\n- CSV export is writing a `csv_export` event to logs\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- move `log_requests` out of AbstactEventLogger base and into its own decorator type which can use an event logger to log events, meaning we can also remove the existing call to `log` method (leaving only `log_event` call)\r\n- turn `DBEventLogger` into a `logging.Handler` impl that looks for `endpoint_invocation` events and does the db persistence that it does today\r\n- migrate `AbstractEventLogger` to `EventLogger` after \r\n- remove `QUERY_LOGGER`, that can be handled by registering logging.Handler impls that act upon incoming `query` event types.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn explore view, when user change controls and run query again, data fetch are triggered twice. see the animated gif below. \r\n\r\nI believe this issue was introduced since #7233. Before that, dashboard will trigger new queries for all charts in dashboard when filter is updated, even for those charts are under nested tabs and not visible. \r\n\r\nIn #7233, we only updated query parameters when filter is updated, but delayed the trigger for new query until chart becomes visible. Instead of call `postChartFormData` to trigger data fetching API,  I added a `componentDidupdate` method for chart component, and use react component state change and triggerQuery flag to trigger the data fetch.\r\n\r\nCurrently explore view container component it also has componentDidUpdate, it will call data fetching API on parent component updated. Together with chart's componentDidupdate change, that's the reason data fetching is called twice.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nDo not need to call `postChartFormData` from exploreview container component.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before**\r\n

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAsync query performance in SQL Lab, particularly with large result sets, is fairly poor due to how data is serialized and stored. This PR introduces a `RESULTS_BACKEND_USE_MSGPACK` config option to use [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/) to serialize the pandas DataFrame directly, and [MessagePack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-python) for serializing the results payload. Compared to the existing JSON serialization, Arrow and MessagePack provide improved performance and result in much smaller payloads sent to S3 or other cache backends.\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks with 100K rows of `birth_names` examples data (multiple runs)\r\n\r\n#### JSON\r\n\r\navg serialization: 573ms\r\navg deserialization: 200ms\r\ntotal: 773ms\r\ncompressed payload size: 816718\r\npeak memory usage: 281.1 MiB\r\n\r\n#### Arrow/msgpack\r\n\r\navg serialization: 70ms\r\navg deserialization: 40ms\r\ntotal: 110ms\r\ncompressed payload size: 452634\r\npeak memory usage: 266.2 MiB\r\n\r\n_Benchmarks were performed on a Macbook Pro 2.6 GHz i7, 32GB running macOS 10.14.5 and Python 3.6.8. [memory-profiler](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/) was used for memory usage stats._\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nTesting thus far has been limited to Postgres, mainly on Superset examples data. For full compatibility testing:\r\n- Enable `RESULTS_BACKEND_USE_MSGPACK = True` in `superset_config.py`\r\n- Run queries in SQL Lab with various DB backends containing multiple data types\r\n- Ensure displayed results and CSV downloads contain correctly formatted data\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@mistercrunch

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [X] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements [SIP-23](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7748), moving the persistence of SQL Lab state from the browser's `localStorage` to the backend.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the redux store in `localStorage` has the following structure:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nsqlLab: {\r\n  activeSouthPaneTab: \"Results\",\r\n  alerts: [],\r\n  databases: {...},\r\n  offline: false,\r\n  queries: {...},\r\n  queriesLastUpdate: 1565918142000,\r\n  queryEditors: [...],\r\n  tabHistory: [...],\r\n  tables: [...],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, when loading SQL Lab the following keys are loaded from the DB:\r\n\r\n- `databases`\r\n- `queries`\r\n- `queryEditors` (from the new tables `tab_state_view` and `table_schema`)\r\n- `tables` (from the new table `table_schema`)\r\n\r\nNote that only the active query editor is fully loaded; for the other tabs only the id and label is loaded, and the content (query, DB, schema, table schemas) is loaded on tab switch.\r\n\r\nAs the user interacts with SQL Lab, changes to `queryEditors`, `tables` and `queries` are synced to the backend automatically. This includes the SQL being written, the table schemas being displayed (expanded or not), the database/schema selected, the active tab, etc.\r\n\r\nFor queries, as soon as a new tab is open we create a row in the `query` table to store the query, even if it hasn't run. This and the syncing of `queryEditors` and `tables` is done through new custom views created in this PR, `/tabstateview/` and `/tableschemaview/`.\r\n\r\nFor results, I changed the backend so that sync queries are also stored in the results backend if one is configured. This allows us to fetch the results when a tab is loaded, without having to store them in the database, since they can be large.\r\n\r\n#### Migration\r\n\r\nThis PR requires a DB migration to set up the initial tables, `tab_state` and `table_schema`. When a user first visits SQL Lab after this migration, the state of the following keys will be a **combination** of the backend (nothing, initially) and their `localStorage`:\r\n\r\n- `queryEditors`\r\n- `tables`\r\n- `tabHistory`\r\n\r\nWhen `<TabbedSqlEditors>` mounts, it will identify objects in these keys that come from `localStorage`, and migrate them to the backend with a custom action `migrateLocalStorage`. Once one of these objects has been migrated successfully, it is removed from `localStorage`, so that the migration doesn't have to be atomic.\r\n\r\nOnce everything has been migrated, the `redux` key in `localStorage` is removed.\r\n\r\n#### Concurrent access from multiple browser tabs\r\n\r\nIt's a non-goal in this PR to handle users working on the same query editor from multiple tabs. The current behavior remains: the last update is persisted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nThere are no visible changes.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI added unit tests for all the modified Redux actions (which required fixing the reducer unit tests, since they were tightly coupled with actions). I also added a new integration test that runs the SQL Lab integration tests with the feature flag enabled.\r\n\r\nI also performed manual testing, testing the migration, adding tabs, renaming them, running queries, removing tabs, loading table schema, etc.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [X] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements [SIP-23](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7748), moving the persistence of SQL Lab state from the browser's `localStorage` to the backend.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the redux store in `localStorage` has the following structure:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nsqlLab: {\r\n  activeSouthPaneTab: \"Results\",\r\n  alerts: [],\r\n  databases: {...},\r\n  offline: false,\r\n  queries: {...},\r\n  queriesLastUpdate: 1565918142000,\r\n  queryEditors: [...],\r\n  tabHistory: [...],\r\n  tables: [...],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, when loading SQL Lab the following keys are loaded from the DB:\r\n\r\n- `databases`\r\n- `queries`\r\n- `queryEditors` (from the new tables `tab_state_view` and the `table_schema`)\r\n- `tables` (from the new table `table_schema`)\r\n\r\nAs the user interacts with SQL Lab, changes to `queryEditors`, `tables` and `queries` are synced to the backend automatically. This includes the SQL being written, the table schemas being displayed (expanded or not), the database/schema selected, the active tab, etc.\r\n\r\nFor queries, as soon as a new tab is open we create a row in the `query` table to store the query, even if it hasn't run. This and the syncing of `queryEditors` and `tables` is done through new custom views created in this PR, `/tabstateview/` and `/tableschemaview/`.\r\n\r\nFor results, I changed the backend so that sync queries are also stored in the results backend if one is configured. This allows us to fetch the results when a tab is loaded, without having to store them in the database, since they can be large.\r\n\r\n#### Migration\r\n\r\nThis PR requires a DB migration to set up the initial tables, `tab_state` and `table_schema`. When a user first visits SQL Lab after this migration, the state of the following keys will be a **combination** of the backend (nothing, initially) and their `localStorage`:\r\n\r\n- `queryEditors`\r\n- `tables`\r\n- `tabHistory`\r\n\r\nWhen `<TabbedSqlEditors>` mounts, it will identify objects in these keys that come from `localStorage`, and migrate them to the backend with a custom action `migrateLocalStorage`. Once one of these objects has been migrated successfully, it is removed from `localStorage`, so that the migration doesn't have to be atomic.\r\n\r\nOnce everything has been migrated, the `redux` key in `localStorage` is removed.\r\n\r\n#### Concurrent access from multiple browser tabs\r\n\r\nIt's a non-goal in this PR to handle users working on the same query editor from multiple tabs. The current behavior remains: the last update is persisted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nThere are no visible changes.\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nBefore starting work to remove circular imports from `db_engine_specs`, this PR aims to add typing and docstrings to most methods in `db_engine_specs`. `sql_parse.py` was also included in this refactor round, as many methods in `db_engine_specs` tied directly back to `spl_parse.py`. The aim was to introduce as few functional changes as possible; however, some slight changes were unavoidable. \r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n- Added docstrings and type annotations to most methods in `BaseEngineSpec` and any child classes (=engines). \r\n- Fixed some small bugs along the way (commented in diff).\r\n- Made some label mutation methods private, as only `make_label_compatible` should be called externally.\r\n- Added `TODO:` comments mostly where typing would cause circular imports. Personally I'm not a big fan of leaving TODOs, but in this case I feel it makes sense to make a separate PR for the circular imports.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nMypy (CI)\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements [SIP-23](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7748), moving the persistence of SQL Lab state from the browser's `localStorage` to the backend.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the redux store in `localStorage` has the following structure:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nsqlLab: {\r\n  activeSouthPaneTab: \"Results\",\r\n  alerts: [],\r\n  databases: {...},\r\n  offline: false,\r\n  queries: {...},\r\n  queriesLastUpdate: 1565918142000,\r\n  queryEditors: [...],\r\n  tabHistory: [...],\r\n  tables: [...],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, when loading SQL Lab the following keys are loaded from the DB:\r\n\r\n- `databases`\r\n- `queries`\r\n- `queryEditors` (from the new tables `tab_state_view` and the `table_schema`)\r\n- `tables` (from the new table `table_schema`)\r\n\r\nAs the user interacts with SQL Lab, changes to `queryEditors`, `tables` and `queries` are synced to the backend automatically. This includes the SQL being written, the table schemas being displayed (expanded or not), the database/schema selected, the active tab, etc.\r\n\r\nFor queries, as soon as a new tab is open we create a row in the `query` table to store the query, even if it hasn't run. This and the syncing of `queryEditors` and `tables` is done through new custom views created in this PR, `/tabstateview/` and `/tableschemaview/`.\r\n\r\nFor results, I changed the backend so that sync queries are also stored in the results backend if one is configured. This allows us to fetch the results when a tab is loaded, without having to store them in the database, since they can be large.\r\n\r\n#### Migration\r\n\r\nThis PR requires a DB migration to set up the initial tables, `tab_state` and `table_schema`. When a user first visits SQL Lab after this migration, the state of the following keys will be a **combination** of the backend (nothing, initially) and their `localStorage`:\r\n\r\n- `queryEditors`\r\n- `tables`\r\n- `tabHistory`\r\n\r\nWhen `<TabbedSqlEditors>` mounts, it will identify objects in these keys that come from `localStorage`, and migrate them to the backend with a custom action `migrateLocalStorage`. Once one of these objects has been migrated successfully, it is removed from `localStorage`, so that the migration doesn't have to be atomic.\r\n\r\nOnce everything has been migrated, the `redux` key in `localStorage` is removed.\r\n\r\n#### Concurrent access from multiple browser tabs\r\n\r\nIt's a non-goal in this PR to handle users working on the same query editor from multiple tabs. The current behavior remains: the last update is persisted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nThere are no visible changes.\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn #7998 I removed some fields when persist redux state into localStorage.\r\nNow i found tables list on the sql lab left panel is quite useful, which displayed columns name and type from tables that user previewed before. Currently when user reload sql lab from localStorage, this table list information is lost.\r\n\r\n**Solution**:\r\nShould persist this tables list into localStorage.\r\nShould persist schema and panel size information for sql editor instance.\r\nAfter this change, the content in redux but **not persisted** in localStorage will be `schemaOptions` and `tableOptions` in queryEditor. \r\nAlso, found a bug in current code, that resized panel size is not persisted in the redux state. Added fix for this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThere's a bug where if you get a chart error, fix the controls, and hit \"Run Query\", the chart doesn't update and get rid of the error. I noticed this on the Time Series Table, if I switch from a line chart to time series table and try to add an item, a chart error appears before I update that control correctly, after it's fixed and I \"run query\" the chart does not update (the same error appears). \r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue with error handling, but we should have another PR that more gracefully handles the time series table errors.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nOpen a line chart, change visualization type to time series table\r\nAdd an item under \"Time Series Columns\"\r\nSee error in chart\r\nCorrectly fill in column configuration info in Time Series Column\r\nRun Query (chart should show up correctly)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes
