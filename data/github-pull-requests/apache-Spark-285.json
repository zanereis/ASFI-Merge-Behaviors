See below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat /home/spark/tmp.py\r\ndef testtest():\r\n    return 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat app.py\r\nimport

did it happen?\r\n\r\nIn client mode specifically, the paths are being added into PythonRunner as are:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/628c7b517969c4a7ccb26ea67ab3dd61266073ca/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L430\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/628c7b517969c4a7ccb26ea67ab3dd61266073ca/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/PythonRunner.scala#L49-L88\r\n\r\nThe problem here is, .py file shouldn't be added as are since `PYTHONPATH` expects a directory or an archive like zip or egg.\r\n\r\n### How does this PR fix?\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't simply just add its parent directory because other files in the parent directory could also be added into the `PYTHONPATH` in client mode before context initialization.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we copy .py files into a temp directory for .py files and add it to `PYTHONPATH`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added and manually tested in both standalond and yarn client modes with submit.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-24T18:17:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:43:41Z","closed_at":"2018-05-30T17:38:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c087b3205855248dd01d4ce409d79832ed8d20e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21426/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21426/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21426/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f015e0d587c8d9f8cd359fecc325a19362a59c55","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-24384","ref":"SPARK-24384","sha":"f015e0d587c8d9f8cd359fecc325a19362a59c55","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20014, Spark won't fails the entire executor but only fails the task suffering `SparkOutOfMemoryError`. After https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21342,  `BroadcastExchangeExec` try-catch `OutOfMemoryError`. Think about below scenario:\r\n\r\n1. `SparkOutOfMemoryError`(subclass of `OutOfMemoryError`) is thrown in `scala.concurrent.Future`;\r\n2. `SparkOutOfMemoryError` is caught and an `OutOfMemoryError` is wrapped in `SparkFatalException` and re-thrown;\r\n3. `ThreadUtils.awaitResult` catches `SparkFatalException` and a `OutOfMemoryError` is thrown;\r\n4. The `OutOfMemoryErro`r will go to `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler.uncaughtException` and Executor fails.\r\n\r\nSo it makes more sense to catch `SparkOutOfMemory` and re-throw `SparkFatalException`, which wraps `SparkOutOfMemory` inside.","created_at":"2018-05-24T11:57:29Z","updated_at":"2018-06-24T07:28:22Z","closed_at":"2018-05-28T13:35:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"efcefad8a77d3c7afb91ef6a063db5939a6e9a78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3a9669cff3486aa98cf0a49e69cc0e08d927affd","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-24379","ref":"SPARK-24379","sha":"3a9669cff3486aa98cf0a49e69cc0e08d927affd","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor some Spark applications, though they're a java program, they require not only jar dependencies, but also python dependencies. One example is Livy remote SparkContext application, this application is actually an embedded REPL for Scala/Python/R, it will not only load in jar dependencies, but also python and R deps, so we should specify not only \"--jars\", but also \"--py-files\".\r\n\r\nCurrently for a Spark application, --py-files can only be worked for a pyspark application, so it will not be worked in the above case. So here propose to remove such restriction.\r\n\r\nAlso we tested that \"spark.submit.pyFiles\" only supports quite limited scenario (client mode with local deps), so here also expand the usage of \"spark.submit.pyFiles\" to be alternative of --py-files.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nuniVocity parser allows to specify only required column names or indexes for [parsing](https://www.univocity.com/pages/parsers-tutorial) like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Here we select only the columns by their indexes.\r\n// The parser just skips the values in other columns\r\nparserSettings.selectIndexes(4, 0, 1);\r\nCsvParser parser = new CsvParser(parserSettings);\r\n```\r\nIn this PR, I propose to extract indexes from required schema and pass them into the CSV parser. Benchmarks show the following improvements in parsing of 1000 columns:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSelect 100 columns out of 1000: x1.76\r\nSelect 1 column out of 1000: x2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: Comparing to current implementation, the changes can return different result for malformed rows in the `DROPMALFORMED` and `FAILFAST` modes if only subset of all columns is requested. To have previous behavior, set `spark.sql.csv.parser.columnPruning.enabled` to `false`.\r\n \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by new test which selects 3 columns out of 15, by existing tests and by new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe interpreted evaluation of several collection operations works only for simple datatypes. For complex data types, for instance, `array_contains` it returns always `false`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent code block manipulation API is immature and hacky. We need a formal API to manipulate code blocks.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is making `JavaCode`  as `TreeNode`. So we can use familiar `transform` API to manipulate code blocks and expressions in code blocks.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can replace `SimpleExprValue` in a code block like this:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncode.transformExprValues {\r\n  case SimpleExprValue(\"1 + 1\", _) => aliasedParam\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example use case is splitting code to methods.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have an `ExprCode` containing generated code. But it is too long and we need to split it as method. Because statement-based expressions can't be directly passed into. We need to transform them as variables first:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n\r\ndef getExprValues(block: Block): Set[ExprValue] = block match {\r\n  case c: CodeBlock =>\r\n    c.blockInputs.collect {\r\n      case e: ExprValue => e\r\n    }.toSet\r\n  case _ => Set.empty\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef currentCodegenInputs(ctx: CodegenContext): Set[ExprValue] = {\r\n  // Collects current variables in ctx.currentVars and ctx.INPUT_ROW.\r\n  // It looks roughly like...\r\n  ctx.currentVars.flatMap { v =>\r\n    getExprValues(v.code) ++ Set(v.value, v.isNull)\r\n  }.toSet + ctx.INPUT_ROW\r\n}\r\n\r\n// A code block of an expression contains too long code, making it as method\r\nif (eval.code.length > 1024) {\r\n  val setIsNull = if (!eval.isNull.isInstanceOf[LiteralValue]) {\r\n    ...\r\n  } else {\r\n    \"\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Pick up variables and statements necessary to pass in.\r\n  val currentVars = currentCodegenInputs(ctx)\r\n  val varsPassIn = getExprValues(eval.code).intersect(currentVars)\r\n  val aliasedExprs = HashMap.empty[SimpleExprValue, VariableValue]\r\n\r\n  // Replace statement-based expressions which can't be directly passed in the method.\r\n  val newCode = eval.code.transform {\r\n    case block =>\r\n      block.transformExprValues {\r\n        case s: SimpleExprValue(_, javaType) if varsPassIn.contains(s) =>\r\n          if (aliasedExprs.contains(s)) {\r\n            aliasedExprs(s)\r\n          } else {\r\n            val aliasedVariable = JavaCode.variable(ctx.freshName(\"aliasedVar\"), javaType)\r\n            aliasedExprs += s -> aliasedVariable\r\n            varsPassIn += aliasedVariable\r\n            aliasedVariable\r\n          }\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  val params = varsPassIn.filter(!_.isInstanceOf[SimpleExprValue])).map { variable =>\r\n    s\"${variable.javaType.getName} ${variable.variableName}\"\r\n  }.mkString(\", \")\r\n\r\n  val funcName = ctx.freshName(\"nodeName\")\r\n  val javaType = CodeGenerator.javaType(dataType)\r\n  val newValue = JavaCode.variable(ctx.freshName(\"value\"), dataType)\r\n  val funcFullName = ctx.addNewFunction(funcName,\r\n    s\"\"\"\r\n      |private $javaType $funcName($params) {\r\n      |  $newCode\r\n      |  $setIsNull\r\n      |  return ${eval.value};\r\n      |}\r\n    \"\"\".stripMargin))\r\n\r\n  eval.value = newValue\r\n  val args = varsPassIn.filter(!_.isInstanceOf[SimpleExprValue])).map { variable =>\r\n    s\"${variable.variableName}\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Create a code block to assign statements to aliased variables.\r\n  val createVariables = aliasedExprs.foldLeft(EmptyBlock) { (block, (statement, variable)) =>\r\n    block + code\"${statement.javaType.getName} $variable = $statement;\"\r\n  }\r\n  eval.code = createVariables + code\"$javaType $newValue = $funcFullName($args);\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUsing struct types in subqueries with the `IN` clause can generate invalid plans in `RewritePredicateSubquery`. Indeed, we are not handling clearly the cases when the outer value is a struct or the output of the inner subquery is a struct.\r\n\r\nThe PR aims to make Spark's behavior the same as the one of the other RDBMS - namely Oracle and Postgres behavior were checked. So we consider valid only queries having the same number of fields in the outer value and in the subquery. This means that:\r\n\r\n - `(a, b) IN (select c, d from ...)` is a valid query;\r\n - `(a, b) IN (select (c, d) from ...)` throws an AnalysisException, as in the subquery we have only one field of type struct while in the outer value we have 2 fields;\r\n - `a IN (select (c, d) from ...)` - where `a` is a struct - is a valid query.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now, the default server side netty handler threads is 2 * # cores, and can be further configured with parameter spark.shuffle.io.serverThreads.\r\nIn order to process a client request, it would require one available server netty handler thread.\r\nHowever, when the server netty handler threads start to process ChunkFetchRequests, they will be blocked on disk I/O, mostly due to disk contentions from the random read operations initiated by all the ChunkFetchRequests received from clients.\r\nAs a result, when the shuffle server is serving many concurrent ChunkFetchRequests, the server side netty handler threads could all be blocked on reading shuffle files, thus leaving no handler thread available to process other types of requests which should all be very quick to process.\r\n\r\nThis issue could potentially be fixed by limiting the number of netty handler threads that could get blocked when processing ChunkFetchRequest. We have a patch to do this by using a separate EventLoopGroup with a dedicated ChannelHandler to process ChunkFetchRequest. This enables shuffle server to reserve netty handler threads for non-ChunkFetchRequest, thus enabling consistent processing time for these requests which are fast to process. After deploying the patch in our infrastructure, we no longer see timeout issues with either executor registration with local shuffle server or shuffle client establishing connection with remote shuffle server.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test for this patch.\r\nIn addition, we built an internal tool to stress test Spark shuffle service and have observed significant improvement after applying this patch.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.","created_at":"2018-05-22T21:56:07Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:54Z","closed_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13fd14faf353391437a6f8e057efc29570a78843","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d862a2dec30f1fefe03d26e0b8a07d10eac7dbf5","head":{"label":"Victsm:SPARK-24355","ref":"SPARK-24355","sha":"d862a2dec30f1fefe03d26e0b8a07d10eac7dbf5","user":{"login":"Victsm","id":4633527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzM1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4633527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm","html_url":"https://github.com/Victsm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":24200099,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDIwMDA5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"Victsm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Victsm","id":4633527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzM1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4633527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm","html_url":"https://github.com/Victsm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Victsm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Victsm/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition of closing Arrow VectorSchemaRoot and Allocator in the writer thread of ArrowPythonRunner. \r\n\r\nThe race results in memory leak exception when closing the allocator. This patch removes the closing routine from the TaskCompletionListener and make the writer thread responsible for cleaning up the Arrow memory.\r\n\r\nThis issue be reproduced by this test:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef test_memory_leak(self):\r\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, col, PandasUDFType, array, lit, explode\r\n\r\n   # Have all data in a single executor thread so it can trigger the race condition easier\r\n    with self.sql_conf({'spark.sql.shuffle.partitions': 1}):\r\n        df = self.spark.range(0, 1000)\r\n        df = df.withColumn('id', array([lit(i) for i in range(0, 300)])) \\\r\n                   .withColumn('id', explode(col('id'))) \\\r\n                   .withColumn('v',  array([lit(i) for i in range(0, 1000)]))\r\n\r\n       @pandas_udf(df.schema, PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP)\r\n       def foo(pdf):\r\n           xxx\r\n           return pdf\r\n\r\n       result = df.groupby('id').apply(foo)\r\n\r\n       with QuietTest(self.sc):\r\n           with self.assertRaises(py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError) as context:\r\n               result.count()\r\n           self.assertTrue('Memory leaked' not in str(context.exception))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Because of the race condition, the test case cannot reproduce the issue reliably so it's not added to test cases.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBecause of the race condition, the bug cannot be unit test easily. So far it has only happens on large amount of data. This is currently tested manually.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-22T15:16:18Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T21:45:45Z","closed_at":"2018-05-28T02:54:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"887e23228b2bdd5538bdeabd6d0c30d89e8cd280","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/756a73aea843e8d5d90994d127c0d9d4c357c67b","head":{"label":"icexelloss:SPARK-24334-arrow-memory-leak","ref":"SPARK-24334-arrow-memory-leak","sha":"756a73aea843e8d5d90994d127c0d9d4c357c67b","user":{"login":"icexelloss","id":793516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss","html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87476665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzQ3NjY2NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"icexelloss/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icexelloss","id":793516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss","html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn adaptive execution, we usually set a big shuffle.parititon. But when shuffle.partition > bucket number, Spark needs to shuffle the bucket table as per the shuffle.partition, this PR tries to avoid this shuffle.\r\n\r\nSee below example:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE dev\r\nUSING PARQUET\r\nAS SELECT ws_item_sk, i_item_sk\r\nFROM web_sales_bucketed\r\nJOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk;\r\n```\r\nSuppose web_sales_bucketed is bucketed into 4 buckets and set shuffle.partition=10.\r\nCurrently, both tables are shuffled into 10 partitions.\r\n```\r\nExecute CreateDataSourceTableAsSelectCommand CreateDataSourceTableAsSelectCommand `dev`, ErrorIfExists, [ws_item_sk#2, i_item_sk#6]\r\n+- *(5) SortMergeJoin [ws_item_sk#2], [i_item_sk#6], Inner\r\n   :- *(2) Sort [ws_item_sk#2 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(ws_item_sk#2, 10)\r\n   :     +- *(1) Project [ws_item_sk#2]\r\n   :        +- *(1) Filter isnotnull(ws_item_sk#2)\r\n   :           +- *(1) FileScan parquet tpcds10.web_sales_bucketed[ws_item_sk#2] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location:...\r\n   +- *(4) Sort [i_item_sk#6 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(i_item_sk#6, 10)\r\n         +- *(3) Project [i_item_sk#6]\r\n            +- *(3) Filter isnotnull(i_item_sk#6)\r\n               +- *(3) FileScan parquet tpcds10.item[i_item_sk#6] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location:...\r\n```\r\nAfter this patch, no shuffle for the buckted table and item table is shuffled with web_sales_bucketed's bucket number(4 partitions).\r\n```\r\nExecute CreateDataSourceTableAsSelectCommand CreateDataSourceTableAsSelectCommand `dev`, ErrorIfExists, [ws_item_sk#2, i_item_sk#6]\r\n+- *(4) SortMergeJoin [ws_item_sk#2], [i_item_sk#6], Inner\r\n   :- *(1) Sort [ws_item_sk#2 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   :  +- *(1) Project [ws_item_sk#2]\r\n   :     +- *(1) Filter isnotnull(ws_item_sk#2)\r\n   :        +- *(1) FileScan parquet tpcds10.web_sales_bucketed[ws_item_sk#2] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location:...\r\n   +- *(3) Sort [i_item_sk#6 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(i_item_sk#6, 4)\r\n         +- *(2) Project [i_item_sk#6]\r\n            +- *(2) Filter isnotnull(i_item_sk#6)\r\n               +- *(2) FileScan parquet tpcds10.item[i_item_sk#6] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location:...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-22T09:44:04Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T07:17:43Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T07:17:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"488d5fb39eee362fafe2708e325d8f8633cc0734","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21391/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21391/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21391/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/896766016e9576f1eb70cea62d38bf2ed897b1d0","head":{"label":"yucai:avoid_shuffle","ref":"avoid_shuffle","sha":"896766016e9576f1eb70cea62d38bf2ed897b1d0","user":{"login":"yucai","id":2989575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai","html_url":"https://github.com/yucai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47689234,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzY4OTIzNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yucai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yucai","id":2989575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai","html_url":"https://github.com/yucai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yucai/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we only clean up the local directories on application removed. However, when executors die and restart repeatedly, many temp files are left untouched in the local directories, which is undesired behavior and could cause disk space used up gradually.\r\n\r\nWe can detect executor death in the Worker, and clean up the non-shuffle files (files not ended with \".index\" or \".data\") in the local directories, we should not touch the shuffle files since they are expected to be used by the external shuffle service.\r\n\r\nScope of this PR is limited to only implement the cleanup logic on a Standalone cluster, we defer to experts familiar with other cluster managers(YARN/Mesos/K8s) to determine whether it's worth to add similar support.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new test suite to cover.","created_at":"2018-05-22T07:13:38Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T12:14:28Z","closed_at":"2018-06-01T20:50:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57a86ec1a534fcadea88bb17e4422d3d61ad9ebd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21390/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21390/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21390/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2011eede002664ef75e00f1f0228c5d765753f4c","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:cleanupNonshuffleFiles","ref":"cleanupNonshuffleFiles","sha":"2011eede002664ef75e00f1f0228c5d765753f4c","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a specific stop method for ContinuousExecution. The previous StreamExecution.stop() method had a race condition as applied to continuous processing: if the cancellation was round-tripped to the driver too quickly, the generic SparkException it caused would be reported as the query death cause. We earlier decided that SparkException should not be added to the StreamExecution.isInterruptionException() whitelist, so we need to ensure this never happens instead.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Refactor ExecuteWriteTask in FileFormatWriter to reduce common logic and improve readability.\r\nAfter the change, callers only need to call `commit()` or `abort` at the end of task.\r\nAlso there is less code in `SingleDirectoryWriteTask` and `DynamicPartitionWriteTask`.\r\nDefinitions of related classes are moved to a new file, and `ExecuteWriteTask` is renamed to `FileFormatDataWriter`.\r\n\r\n2. As per code style guide: https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide#traversal-and-zipwithindex , we avoid using `for` for looping in [FileFormatWriter](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21381/files#diff-3b69eb0963b68c65cfe8075f8a42e850L536) , or `foreach` in [WriteToDataSourceV2Exec](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21381/files#diff-6fbe10db766049a395bae2e785e9d56eL119).\r\nIn such critical code path, using `while` is good for performance.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit test.\r\nI tried the microbenchmark in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21409\r\n\r\n| Workload | Before changes(Best/Avg Time(ms)) | After changes(Best/Avg Time(ms)) |\r\n| --- | --- | -- |\r\n|Output Single Int Column|    2018 / 2043   |    2096 / 2236 |\r\n|Output Single Double Column| 1978 / 2043 | 2013 / 2018 |\r\n|Output Int and String Column| 6332 / 6706 | 6162 / 6298 |\r\n|Output Partitions| 4458 / 5094 |  3792 / 4008  |\r\n|Output Buckets|           5695 / 6102 |    5120 / 5154 |\r\n\r\nAlso a microbenchmark on my laptop for general comparison among while/foreach/for :\r\n```\r\nclass Writer {\r\n  var sum = 0L\r\n  def write(l: Long): Unit = sum += l\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef testWhile(iterator: Iterator[Long]): Long = {\r\n  val w = new Writer\r\n  while (iterator.hasNext) {\r\n    w.write(iterator.next())\r\n  }\r\n  w.sum\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef testForeach(iterator: Iterator[Long]): Long = {\r\n  val w = new Writer\r\n  iterator.foreach(w.write)\r\n  w.sum\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef testFor(iterator: Iterator[Long]): Long = {\r\n  val w = new Writer\r\n  for (x <- iterator) {\r\n    w.write(x)\r\n  }\r\n  w.sum\r\n}\r\n\r\nval

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe tests cover basic functionality of [Hadoop LinesReader](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8d79113b812a91073d2c24a3a9ad94cc3b90b24a/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/HadoopFileLinesReader.scala#L42). In particular, the added tests check:\r\n\r\n- A split slices a line or delimiter\r\n- A split slices two consecutive lines and cover a delimiter between the lines\r\n- Two splits slice a line and there are no duplicates\r\n- Internal buffer size (`io.file.buffer.size`) is less than line length\r\n- Constrain of maximum line length - `mapreduce.input.linerecordreader.line.maxlength`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-20T17:14:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:56Z","closed_at":"2018-05-21T21:25:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3064ca910af514b9330881c1ceaac36c453e6c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21377/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21377/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21377/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/31ac9ca4e992f234df63d09c2934919f24fe20d4","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:line-reader-tests","ref":"line-reader-tests","sha":"31ac9ca4e992f234df63d09c2934919f24fe20d4","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21299 which broke build.\r\n\r\nA few new commits are added to fix the SQLConf problem in `JsonSchemaInference.infer`, and prevent us to access `SQLConf` in DAGScheduler event loop thread.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously in #20136 we decided to forbid tasks to access `SQLConf`, because it doesn't work and always give you the default conf value. In #21190 we fixed the check and all the places that violate it.\r\n\r\nCurrently the pattern of accessing configs at the executor side is: read the configs at the driver side, then access the variables holding the config values in the RDD closure, so that they will be serialized to the executor side. Something like\r\n```\r\nval someConf = conf.getXXX\r\nchild.execute().mapPartitions {\r\n  if (someConf == ...) ...\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this pattern is hard to apply if the config needs to be propagated via a long call stack. An example is `DataType.sameType`, and see how many changes were made in #21190 .\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to code generation, it's even worse. I tried it locally and we need to change a ton of files to propagate configs to code generators.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to allow tasks to access `SQLConf`. The idea is, we can save all the SQL configs to job properties when an SQL execution is triggered. At executor side we rebuild the `SQLConf` from job properties.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nORC 1.4.4 includes [nine fixes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12342568&jql=project%20%3D%20ORC%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Fixed%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%201.4.4). One of the issues is about `Timestamp` bug (ORC-306) which occurs when `native` ORC vectorized reader reads ORC column vector's sub-vector `times` and `nanos`. ORC-306 fixes this according to the [original definition](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/storage-api/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/vector/TimestampColumnVector.java#L45-L46) and this PR includes the updated interpretation on ORC column vectors. Note that `hive` ORC reader and ORC MR reader is not affected.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.version\r\nres0: String = 2.3.0\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"set spark.sql.orc.impl=native\")\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add eager execution into the `__repr__` and `_repr_html_` of the DataFrame APIs in PySpark. When eager evaluation is enabled, `_repr_html_` returns a rich HTML version of the top-K rows of the DataFrame output. If `_repr_html_` is not called by REPL, `_repr_` will return the plain text of the top-K rows.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds three new external SQL confs for controlling the behavior of eager evaluation:\r\n\r\n- `spark.sql.repl.eagerEval.enabled`: Enables eager evaluation or not. When true, the top K rows of Dataset will be displayed if and only if the REPL supports the eager evaluation. Currently, the eager evaluation is only supported in PySpark. For the notebooks like Jupyter, the HTML table (generated by `_repr_html_`) will be returned. For plain Python REPL, the returned outputs are formatted like dataframe.show().\r\n\r\n- `spark.sql.repl.eagerEval.maxNumRows`: The max number of rows that are returned by eager evaluation. This only takes effect when `spark.sql.repl.eagerEval.enabled` is set to true.\r\n\r\n- `spark.sql.repl.eagerEval.truncate`: The max number of characters for each cell that is returned by eager evaluation. This only takes effect when `spark.sql.repl.eagerEval.enabled` is set to true.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew ut in DataFrameSuite and manual test in jupyter.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR solves [SPARK-22713](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22713) which describes a memory leak that occurs when and ExternalAppendOnlyMap is spilled during iteration (opposed to  insertion).\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\nExternalAppendOnlyMap's iterator supports spilling but it kept a reference to the internal map (via an internal iterator) after spilling, it seems that the original code was actually supposed to 'get rid' of this reference on the next iteration but according to the elaborate investigation described in the JIRA this didn't happen.\r\nthe fix was simply replacing the internal iterator immediately after spilling.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI've introduced a new test to test suite ExternalAppendOnlyMapSuite, this test asserts that neither the external map itself nor its iterator hold any reference to the internal map after a spill.\r\nThese approach required some access relaxation of some members variables and nested classes of ExternalAppendOnlyMap, this members are now package provate and annotated with @VisibleForTesting.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-19T05:11:02Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T12:59:46Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T12:59:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48fa047ccc3f9a6341c734ed3f71026889eae4c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21369/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21369/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21369/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/855854af4762057438b996c58639a38c773ac0bb","head":{"label":"eyalfa:SPARK-22713__ExternalAppendOnlyMap_effective_spill","ref":"SPARK-22713__ExternalAppendOnlyMap_effective_spill","sha":"855854af4762057438b996c58639a38c773ac0bb","user":{"login":"eyalfa","id":1131833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE4MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1131833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa","html_url":"https://github.com/eyalfa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64462239,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDQ2MjIzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"eyalfa/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eyalfa","id":1131833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE4MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1131833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa","html_url":"https://github.com/eyalfa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalfa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eyalfa/spark","description":"Mirror

in spark-shell, if the session fails to start, the\r\nuser sees a bunch of unrelated errors which are caused by code\r\nin the shell initialization that references the \"spark\" variable,\r\nwhich does not exist in that case. Things like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<console>:14: error: not found: value spark\r\n       import spark.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user is also left with a non-working shell (unless they want\r\nto just write non-Spark Scala or Python code, that is).\r\n\r\nThis change fails the whole shell session at the point where the\r\nfailure occurs, so that the last error message is the one with\r\nthe actual information about the failure.\r\n\r\nFor the python error handling, I moved the session initialization code\r\nto session.py, so that traceback.print_exc() only shows the last error.\r\nOtherwise, the printed exception would contain all previous exceptions\r\nwith a message \"During handling of the above exception, another\r\nexception occurred\", making the actual error kinda hard to parse.\r\n\r\nTested with spark-shell, pyspark (with 2.7 and 3.5), by forcing an\r\nerror during SparkContext initialization.","created_at":"2018-05-18T22:52:32Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T20:37:58Z","closed_at":"2018-06-05T01:33:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bed7b470f5e3fb8ce9c5970408f119410917fb57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d53ca024a5f88d7d3dcd41257c3de72aadd40b6","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-16451","ref":"SPARK-16451","sha":"6d53ca024a5f88d7d3dcd41257c3de72aadd40b6","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously, the scheduler backend was maintaining state in many places, not only for reading state but also writing to it. For example, state had to be managed in both the watch and in the executor allocator runnable. Furthermore, one had to keep track of multiple hash tables.\r\n\r\nWe can do better here by:\r\n\r\n1. Consolidating the places where we manage state. Here, we take inspiration from traditional Kubernetes controllers. These controllers tend to follow a level-triggered mechanism. This means that the controller will continuously monitor the API server via watches and polling, and on periodic passes, the controller will reconcile the current state of the cluster with the desired state. We implement this by introducing the concept of a pod snapshot, which is a given state of the executors in the Kubernetes cluster. We operate periodically on snapshots. To prevent overloading the API server with polling requests to get the state of the cluster (particularly for executor allocation where we want to be checking frequently to get executors to launch without unbearably bad latency), we use watches to populate snapshots by applying observed events to a previous snapshot to get a new snapshot. Whenever we do poll the cluster, the polled state replaces any existing snapshot - this ensures eventual consistency and mirroring of the cluster, as is desired in a level triggered architecture.\r\n\r\n2. Storing less specialized in-memory state in general. Previously we were creating hash tables to represent the state of executors. Instead, it's easier to represent state solely by the snapshots.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIntegration tests should test there's no regressions end to end. Unit tests to be updated, in particular focusing on different orderings of events, particularly accounting for when events come in unexpected ordering.\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-18T21:24:15Z","updated_at":"2018-06-18T23:39:00Z","closed_at":"2018-06-14T23:00:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"184ef04de5e27dcf6924f85ec98522d1caa772b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21366/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21366/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21366/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a99dceeb9dfbfc58e26885c290461cbf37a5428","head":{"label":"palantir:event-queue-driven-scheduling","ref":"event-queue-driven-scheduling","sha":"1a99dceeb9dfbfc58e26885c290461cbf37a5428","user":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30919203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDkxOTIwMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"palantir/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/palantir/spark","description":"Palantir

SparkPlan.prepare() could be called in different threads (BroadcastExchange will call it in a thread pool). Thus, we could serialize the same Parquet filter at the same time. This is not easily reproduced. The fix is to avoid serializing these Parquet filters in the driver. This PR is to avoid serializing these Parquet filters by moving the parquet filter generation from the driver to executors.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHaving two queries one is a 1000-line SQL query and a 3000-line SQL query. Need to run at least one hour with a heavy write workload to reproduce once.","created_at":"2018-05-17T06:18:12Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T04:17:46Z","closed_at":"2018-05-17T15:50:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"671bb569c14c66ce409f27016a413e575c6a5134","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90cec34d360e77af9c665d7835c45b7748ee536c","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:backportSPARK-24002","ref":"backportSPARK-24002","sha":"90cec34d360e77af9c665d7835c45b7748ee536c","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a working followup to the expression work begun in #20085. It provides necessary `Expression` definitions to support custom encoders (see this discussion in the [Spark-Avro](https://github.com/databricks/spark-avro/pull/217#issuecomment-342856719) project).\r\n\r\nIt adds the following expressions:\r\n\r\n* `ObjectCast` - performs explicit casting of an `Expression` result to a `DataType`\r\n* `StaticField` - retrieves a static field against a class that otherwise has no accessor method\r\n* `InstanceOf` - an `Expression` for the Java `instanceof` operation\r\n\r\nModifies `NewInstance` to take a sequence of method-name and arguments initialization tuples, which are executed against the newly constructed object instance.\r\n\r\nRemoves `InitializeJavaBean`, as the generalized `NewInstance` subsumes its use-case. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdds unit test for `NewInstance` supporting post-constructor initializations. All previous \"JavaBean\" tests were refactored to use `NewInstance`.\r\n\r\nAdditional examples of working encoders that would use these new expressions can be seen in the [Spark-Avro](https://github.com/bdrillard/spark-avro/blob/avro_encoder_2-4/src/main/scala/com/databricks/spark/avro/AvroEncoder.scala) and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEnabled no-data batches in flatMapGroupsWithState in following two cases.\r\n- When ProcessingTime timeout is used, then we always run a batch every trigger interval. \r\n- When event-time watermark is defined, then the user may be doing arbitrary logic against the watermark value even if timeouts are not set.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr proposes to support distinct window functions. After this change, query like below are supported:\r\n```\r\nSELECT val, cate,\r\nsum(val) OVER (PARTITION BY cate) AS sum1,\r\nsum(DISTINCT val) OVER (PARTITION BY cate) AS sum2\r\nFROM testData\r\n```\r\nIn this pr:\r\n1. ORDER BY and distinct window function don't work at the same time due to performance concern and implementation requirement.\r\n2. Insert distinct fields into the order by list, thus during counting, we only need to compare the current row against the previous row, i we ignore the current row if they have same projected values.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is inherited from hive.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest added and more tests to be added.","created_at":"2018-05-15T11:51:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T09:46:36Z","closed_at":"2019-07-17T09:46:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"721d6e78303406058938d0e4ad2c6f86f82b0290","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d86ba76e3e55820c6eb4c859b33bdced7d84b595","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-22234","ref":"SPARK-22234","sha":"d86ba76e3e55820c6eb4c859b33bdced7d84b595","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror
