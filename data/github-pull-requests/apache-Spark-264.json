What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to make creation of typed Literals `TIMESTAMP` and `DATE` consistent to the `Cast` expression. More precisely, reusing the `Cast` expression in the type constructors. In this way, it allows:\r\n- To use the same calendar in parsing methods\r\n- To support the same set of timestamp/date patterns\r\n\r\nFor example, creating timestamp literal:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2019-01-14 20:54:00.000'\r\n```\r\nbehaves similarly as casting the string literal:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT CAST('2019-01-14 20:54:00.000' AS TIMESTAMP)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested by `SQLQueryTestSuite` as well as `ExpressionParserSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-14T21:26:11Z","updated_at":"2019-12-23T11:18:36Z","closed_at":"2019-01-18T11:51:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f132319cc95f038e727359c401dddf2569f8d3d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/09cbfbdee1ea4ace5279f355517c251dc1df7c1f","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:timestamp-date-constructors","ref":"timestamp-date-constructors","sha":"09cbfbdee1ea4ace5279f355517c251dc1df7c1f","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixing resource leaks where TransportClient/TransportServer instances are not closed properly.\r\n\r\nIn StandaloneSchedulerBackend the null check is added because during the SparkContextSchedulerCreationSuite #\"local-cluster\" test it turned out that client is not initialised as org.apache.spark.scheduler.cluster.StandaloneSchedulerBackend#start isn't called. It throw an NPE and some resource remained in open. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy executing the unittests and using some extra temporary logging for counting created and closed TransportClient/TransportServer instances.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-14T18:45:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T15:03:32Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T15:03:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"23812e168f281369416b0e758106c85d6b5ee37a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23540/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23540/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23540/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47caad6b3f9d31788736570196e5fcc402247b57","head":{"label":"attilapiros:leaks","ref":"leaks","sha":"47caad6b3f9d31788736570196e5fcc402247b57","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixed several places in CacheManager where a write lock was being held while running the query optimizer.  This could cause a very lock block if the query optimization takes a long time.  This builds on changes from [SPARK-26548] that fixed this issue for one specific case in the CacheManager.\r\n\r\n@gatorsmile This is very similar to the PR you approved last week.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHas been tested on a live system where the blocking was causing major issues and it is working well.\r\nCacheManager has no explicit unit test but is used in many places internally as part of the SharedState.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-14T18:01:38Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T02:52:12Z","closed_at":"2019-01-24T02:52:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c2ff3b6b686a12af0a7ce3d2c0e22061d9332d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/67631dcd937098b33f0c93be1012faf9ac903cbb","head":{"label":"DaveDeCaprio:cache-manager-locks","ref":"cache-manager-locks","sha":"67631dcd937098b33f0c93be1012faf9ac903cbb","user":{"login":"DaveDeCaprio","id":841146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79563979,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTU2Mzk3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"DaveDeCaprio/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveDeCaprio","id":841146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds recursive query feature to Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nA recursive query is defined using the `WITH RECURSIVE` keywords and referring the name of the common table expression within the query.\r\nThe implementation complies with SQL standard and follows similar rules to other relational databases:\r\n- A query is made of an anchor followed by a recursive term.\r\n- The anchor terms doesn't contain self reference and it is used to initialize the query.\r\n- The recursive term contains a self reference and it is used to expand the current set of rows with new ones.\r\n- The anchor and recursive terms must be joined with each other by `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operators.\r\n- New rows can only be derived from the newly added rows of the previous iteration (or from the initial set of rows of anchor terms). This limitation implies that recursive references can't be used with some of the joins, aggregations or subqueries.\r\n\r\nPlease see `cte-recursive.sql` and `with.sql` for some examples.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this PR focuses on the minimal working implementation which means:\r\n- SQL recursion is actually loop where the current iteration is computed based on the previous one's result and when an iteration returns no rows the loop is over. The final result is the union of all iteration results. This means that caching intermediate results could speed up the process, but caching was removed from this PR to reduce complexity and can be added back in a follow-up PR.\r\n- A common way to stop SQL recursion is using the LIMIT operator to stop computing more than the required number of rows. LIMIT support was removed from this PR to reduce complexity and can be added back in a follow-up PR.\r\n- Some relational databases are more relaxed in terms how many anchor and recursive terms can be in a recursion. This PR allows the most simple case and allows only 1-1 of them. A follow-up PR can target to relax this limitation.\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecursive query is an ANSI SQL feature that is useful to process hierarchical data.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds recursive query feature.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs and tests in `cte-recursion.sql` and `with.sql`.

change addes a new mode for credential renewal that does not require\r\na keytab; it uses the local ticket cache instead, so it works while the\r\nuser keeps the cache valid.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful for, e.g., people running long spark-shell sessions where\r\ntheir kerberos login is kept up-to-date.\r\n\r\nThe main change to enable this behavior is in HadoopDelegationTokenManager,\r\nwith a small change in the HDFS token provider. The other changes are to avoid\r\ncreating duplicate tokens when submitting the application to YARN; they allow\r\nthe tokens from the scheduler to be sent to the YARN AM, reducing the round trips\r\nto HDFS.\r\n\r\nFor that, the scheduler initialization code was changed a little bit so that\r\nthe tokens are available when the YARN client is initialized. That basically\r\ntakes care of a long-standing TODO that was in the code to clean up configuration\r\npropagation to the driver's RPC endpoint (in CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend).\r\n\r\nTested with an app designed to stress this functionality, with both keytab and\r\ncache-based logins. Some basic kerberos tests on k8s also.","created_at":"2019-01-11T22:26:15Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T21:26:39Z","closed_at":"2019-01-28T21:36:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ccb08e1d693e4165c0b48236cc80bcfd5aea2b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/57aed4706768f87fb6bbcf1823d35e66f517d485","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-26595","ref":"SPARK-26595","sha":"57aed4706768f87fb6bbcf1823d35e66f517d485","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is to fix a bug in #23036 that would cause a join hint to be applied on node it is not supposed to after join reordering. For example,\r\n```\r\n  val join = df.join(df, \"id\")\r\n  val broadcasted = join.hint(\"broadcast\")\r\n  val join2 = join.join(broadcasted, \"id\").join(broadcasted, \"id\")\r\n```\r\nThere should only be 2 broadcast hints on `join2`, but after join reordering there would be 4. It is because the hint application in join reordering compares the attribute set for testing relation equivalency.\r\nMoreover, it could still be problematic even if the child relations were used in testing relation equivalency, due to the potential exprId conflict in nested self-join. \r\n\r\nAs a result, this PR simply reverts the join reorder hint behavior change introduced in #23036, which means if a join hint is present, the join node itself will not participate in the join reordering, while the sub-joins within its children still can.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-11T21:31:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T04:05:51Z","closed_at":"2019-01-13T23:33:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9df2544a776deed3dccb2fd2722e7bdc0175cf27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23524/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23524/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23524/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a12b126cf36d48899f80e7e8c82b27953fd96d4","head":{"label":"maryannxue:query-hint-followup-2","ref":"query-hint-followup-2","sha":"1a12b126cf36d48899f80e7e8c82b27953fd96d4","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ChunkFetchIntegrationSuite.fetchBothChunks` fails frequently due to timeout in Apache Spark Jenkins

The timeout seems to be too sensitive in low-end machines. This PR increases the timeout from 5 seconds to 60 seconds in order to be more robust.\r\n\r\n- [master

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNow in `TransportRequestHandler.processStreamRequest`, when a stream request is processed, the stream id is not registered with the current channel in stream manager. It should do that so in case of that the channel gets terminated we can remove associated streams of stream requests too.\r\n\r\nThis also cleans up channel registration in `StreamManager`. Since `StreamManager` doesn't register channel but only `OneForOneStreamManager` does it, this removes `registerChannel` from `StreamManager`. When `OneForOneStreamManager` goes to register stream, it will also register channel for the stream.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Covers latest minikube versions.\r\n- keeps the older version support\r\n\r\nNote: While I was facing disk pressure issues locally on machine, I noticed minikube status command would report that everything was working fine even if some kube-system pods were not up. I don't think the output is 100% reliable but it is good enough for most cases.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRun it against latest version of minikube

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBroardCast hint can not work with `PruneFileSourcePartitions`, for example, when the filter condition p is a partition field, table b in SQL below cannot be broadcast.\r\n\r\n`   sql(\"select /*+ broadcastjoin(b) */ * from (select a from empty_test where p=1) a \" +\r\n      \"join (select a,b from par_1 where p=1) b on a.a=b.a\").explain`\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `PruneFileSourcePartitions ` deleted `ResolvedHint ` when matching `PhysicalOperations`, the plan after `PruneFileSourcePartitions ` before this PR is:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26834091/51019165-eada9180-15b4-11e9-93da-3f435cac6049.png)\r\n  \r\nThe original reason for this problem is that when `PhysicalOperation ` matches ResolvedHint, it returns directly to its child nodes and skips over itself.\r\n`case h: ResolvedHint =>\r\n        collectProjectsAndFilters(h.child)`\r\n\r\nThis PR adds processing to `ResolvedHint `,  when matched to it in `PruneFileSourcePartitions`, skip it directly and parse its child nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit test of

support --haveconf  and --hivevar。But it set hiveconf and hivevar in every sql in class SparkSQLOperationManager，i think this is not suitable。So i make a little modify to set --hiveconf and --hivevar in class SparkSQLSessionManager, it will only run once in open HiveServer2 session, instead of ervery sql to init --hiveconf and --hivevar\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually run the tests against minikube as usual.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-11T07:09:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T05:10:38Z","closed_at":"2019-09-10T05:10:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0ce748378d4607ee20176a3c52ae6b97514726d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23516/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23516/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23516/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca7080d28bb2d49245602cc6bcb770b57743697b","head":{"label":"wangtao605:my_change","ref":"my_change","sha":"ca7080d28bb2d49245602cc6bcb770b57743697b","user":{"login":"wangtao605","id":35913385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTEzMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35913385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605","html_url":"https://github.com/wangtao605","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119345133,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkzNDUxMzM=","name":"spark","full_name":"wangtao605/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangtao605","id":35913385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTEzMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35913385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605","html_url":"https://github.com/wangtao605","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangtao605/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangtao605/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix race condition where streams can have unexpected conf values. \r\n\r\nNew streaming queries should run with isolated SparkSessions so that they aren't affected by conf updates after they are started. In StreamExecution, the parent SparkSession is cloned and used to run each batch, but this cloning happens in a separate thread and may happen after DataStreamWriter.start() returns. If a stream is started and a conf key is set immediately after, the stream is likely to have the new value.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test that fails prior to the production change and passes with it.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16989\r\n\r\nThe fetch-block-to-disk feature is disabled by default, because it's not compatible with external shuffle service prior to Spark 2.2. The client sends stream request to fetch block chunks, and old shuffle service can't support it.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new approach:\r\n1. extend `ChunkFetchRequest` to add an optional `fetchAsStream` boolean flag. It will only be encoded to the message when it's true. `ChunkFetchRequest` from old clients do not have this flag, which means this flag is false for them.\r\n2. server side takes care of the new flag in `ChunkFetchRequest`. If the flag is true, return a new chunk stream response, otherwise return a normal chunk fetch response.\r\n3. when client side sends `ChunkFetchRequest` with `fetchAsStream=true`, it will set up two callbacks for the new chunk stream response and the normal chunk fetch response. This is necessary because the server side may be an old version which ignores the `fetchAsStream` flag.\r\n\r\nThis is fully compatible:\r\n1. new client <-> new server: Definitely fine\r\n2. old client <-> new server: The `ChunkFetchRequest` message doesn't have the `fetchAsStream` flag, the server treats it as a normal fetch request, and returns normal fetch request response.\r\n3. new client <-> old server: The `ChunkFetchRequest` message contains the `fetchAsStream` flag, but the old server doesn't know about it and stops reading the message right before the `fetchAsStream` part. Then the old server returns normal chunk fetch response, and new client accept it.\r\n\r\nNote that, the previous server side changes made in #16989 are still there, so clients of Spark 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 with fetch-block-to-disk enabled still work.\r\n\r\nTODO: setup different versions of shuffle service and test it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-10T17:09:35Z","updated_at":"2019-01-23T07:57:24Z","closed_at":"2019-01-23T07:57:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"003429c9c2278df4bebf0d5110324b1755957ef9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e1a05b088cabddc986e0a3d8e126095f0f7b32b","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:shuffle","ref":"shuffle","sha":"6e1a05b088cabddc986e0a3d8e126095f0f7b32b","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI enable dynamic allocation feature with **spark-shell** and do not submit any task. After **spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout** seconds(default 60s), there is still one active executor, which is abnormal. All idle executors are timeout and should be removed.(default  **spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors**=0). The spark-shell command show below:\r\n\r\n`spark-shell --master=yarn --conf spark.ui.port=8040 --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors=8 --conf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using SparkSQL, for example the ThriftServer, if we set\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.hive.fileInputFormat.enabled=true`\r\n\r\nwe can optimize the InputFormat to CombineTextInputFormat automatically if it's TextInputFormat before. And we can also change the max/min size of input splits by setting, for example \r\n\r\n`spark.sql.hive.fileInputFormat.split.maxsize=268435456`\r\n`spark.sql.hive.fileInputFormat.split.minsize=134217728`\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we have to modify Hive Configs and structure of tables.\r\n\r\nAnd we made a test by using a Hive table with a lot of small files in HDFS and haven't combined :\r\n\r\nBefore

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`UserDefinedPredicate.keep(T)` shall handle `null` values because the **parquet-mr** library do invokes it maybe a null. This is the only way the filtering API can check if a null value fulfills the UDP.\r\nIt did not throw exception before the [ColumnIndex](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1201) feature because the statistics and the dictionary filters invokes `keep(T)` only in some special scenarios (e.g. if all the values are null in the column chunk).\r\nThis pr handle null values for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using SparkSQL, for example the ThriftServer, if we set\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.hive.fileInputFormat.enabled=true`\r\n\r\nwe can optimize the InputFormat to CombineTextInputFormat automatically if it's TextInputFormat before. And we can also change the max/min size of input splits by setting, for example \r\n\r\n`spark.sql.hive.fileInputFormat.split.maxsize=268435456`\r\n`spark.sql.hive.fileInputFormat.split.minsize=134217728`\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we have to modify Hive Configs and structure of tables.\r\n\r\nAnd we made a test by using a Hive table with a lot of small files in HDFS and haven't combined :\r\n\r\nBefore

Unit tests, an example in shell, and the PR description (https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23936, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21073) say that duplicated keys will be duplicated, but the function description says the opposite.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT map_concat(map(1, 'a', 2, 'b'), map(2, 'c', 3, 'd'))\").show(20,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark table maintains Hive catalog storage format, so that Hive client can read it.  In `HiveSerDe.scala`, Spark uses a mapping from its data source to HiveSerde. The mapping is old, we need to update with latest canonical name of Parquet and Orc FileFormat.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the following queries will result in wrong Serde value in Hive table(default value `org.apache.hadoop.mapred.SequenceFileInputFormat`), and Hive client will fail to read the output table:\r\n```\r\ndf.write.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat\").saveAsTable(..)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf.write.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc.OrcFileFormat\").saveAsTable(..)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor SparkSQL ,when we open AE by 'set spark.sql.adapative.enable=true'，the ExchangeCoordinator will introduced to determine the number of post-shuffle partitions. But in some certain conditions,the coordinator performed not very well, there are always some tasks retained and they worked with Shuffle Read Size / Records 0.0B/0 ,We could increase the spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.targetPostShuffleInputSize to solve this,but this action is unreasonable as targetPostShuffleInputSize Should not be set too large. As follow:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20614350/50747129-5519cc00-126d-11e9-8511-8cdb324366c9.png)\r\n\r\nWe could   reproduce this problem easily with the SQL:\r\n\r\n`set spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=true；`\r\n`  spark.sql.shuffle.partitions 100；`\r\n`  spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.targetPostShuffleInputSize  33554432 ；`\r\n`  SELECT a,COUNT(1) FROM TABLE  GROUP BY  a DISTRIBUTE BY cast(rand()* 10 as bigint)` \r\n\r\nbefore fix：\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20614350/50747540-577d2580-126f-11e9-80b0-1b36fc2fd692.png)\r\nafter

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor SparkSQL ,when we open AE by 'set spark.sql.adapative.enable=true'，the ExchangeCoordinator will introduced to determine the number of post-shuffle partitions. But in some certain conditions,the coordinator performed not very well, there are always some tasks retained and they worked with Shuffle Read Size / Records 0.0B/0 ,We could increase the spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.targetPostShuffleInputSize to solve this,but this action is unreasonable as targetPostShuffleInputSize Should not be set too large. As follow:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20614350/50747129-5519cc00-126d-11e9-8511-8cdb324366c9.png)\r\n\r\nWe could   reproduce this problem easily with the SQL:\r\n\r\n`set

This is a release blocker.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -s --head --fail \"https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=spark.git;a=commit;h=v3.0.0\"\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Sun, 06 Jan 2019 22:42:39 GMT\r\nServer: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)\r\nVary: Accept-Encoding\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: X-PINGOTHER\r\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 1728000\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./do-release-docker.sh -d /tmp/test -n\r\nBranch [branch-2.4]:\r\nCurrent branch version is 2.4.1-SNAPSHOT.\r\nRelease [2.4.1]:\r\nRC # [1]:\r\nv2.4.1-rc1 already exists.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAddress SPARK-26548, in Spark 2.4.0, the CacheManager holds a write lock while computing the executedPlan for a cached logicalPlan.  In some cases with very large query plans this can be an expensive operation, taking minutes to run.  The entire cache is blocked during this time.  This PR changes that so the writeLock is only obtained after the executedPlan is generated, this reduces the time the lock is held to just the necessary time when the shared data structure is being updated.\r\n\r\n@gatorsmile and @cloud-fan - You can committed patches in this area before.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.x, literal values are parsed as `DECIMAL`s. Many RDBMS, instead, treat them as `DOUBLE`. Among those, we can name Presto, Hive and MSSQL. The last 2 are particularly important for us, because they are the 2 which we used as reference for our implementation of decimal operations.\r\n\r\nIn the current scenario, specific constant  - eg. `1e10` - are parsed as `DECIMAL`s with negative scale. This is a case which is not handled properly by Spark currently and there is an ongoing PR for fixing the operations rules for this case. Despite this PR doesn't forbid completely decimals with negative scale, anyway it reduces considerably the cases when this can happen, resolving naturally the problem mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces the config option `spark.sql.legacy.literals.asDecimal` which can be used in order to restore the previous behavior\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmodified/enhanced

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-4105 added corruption detection in shuffle blocks but that was limited to blocks which are\r\nsmaller than maxBytesInFlight/3. This commit adds upon that by adding corruption check for large\r\nblocks. There are two changes/improvements that are made in this commit:\r\n\r\n1. Large blocks are checked upto maxBytesInFlight/3 size in a similar way as smaller blocks, so if a\r\nlarge block is corrupt in the starting, that block will be re-fetched and if that also fails,\r\nFetchFailureException will be thrown.\r\n2. If large blocks are corrupt after size maxBytesInFlight/3, then any IOException thrown while\r\nreading the stream will be converted to FetchFailureException.  This is slightly more aggressive\r\nthan was originally intended but since the consumer of the stream may have already read some records and processed them, we can't just re-fetch the block, we need to fail the whole task. Additionally, we also thought about maybe adding a new type of TaskEndReason, which would re-try the task couple of times before failing the previous stage, but given the complexity involved in that solution we decided to not proceed in that direction.\r\n\r\nThanks to @squito for direction and support.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nChanged the junit test for big blocks to check for corruption.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-04T17:35:08Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T19:30:06Z","closed_at":"2019-03-12T19:30:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9407cd92cc3aea43d894bc0c2aacf901738bd3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d36c86251946e88a36e2e977d8ae1a0ae815a8d5","head":{"label":"ankuriitg:ankurgupta/SPARK-26089","ref":"ankurgupta/SPARK-26089","sha":"d36c86251946e88a36e2e977d8ae1a0ae815a8d5","user":{"login":"ankuriitg","id":1723600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1723600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg","html_url":"https://github.com/ankuriitg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":134297219,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzQyOTcyMTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"ankuriitg/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ankuriitg","id":1723600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1723600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg","html_url":"https://github.com/ankuriitg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankuriitg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ankuriitg/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, heartbeat related arguments is not validated in spark, so if these args are inproperly specified, the Application may run for a while and not failed until the max executor failures reached(especially with spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true), thus may incurs resources waste.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to precheck these arguments in
