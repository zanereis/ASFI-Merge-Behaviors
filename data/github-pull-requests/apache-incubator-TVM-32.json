rules that rewrite `min(floordiv(x + (A-1), A) * A, max(x, A))` and `min(truncdiv(x + (A-1), A) * A, max(x, A))` into `max(x, A)` did not have sufficiently tight bounds.  The `truncdiv` rule required that `x >= 0`, while the `floordiv` rule had no requirement on `x`.  In both cases, the simplification was incorrect when `x==0`, as it would result in a rewrite from `min(0, max(0, A))` into `max(0, A)`.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the rules to require that `x >= 0` for each of these rules.","created_at":"2023-02-06T20:53:18Z","updated_at":"2023-02-07T14:24:12Z","closed_at":"2023-02-07T05:07:55Z","merged_at":"2023-02-07T05:07:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"282f17584b36267dc17d84e2ea50b94444db898a","assignee":{"login":"wrongtest-intellif","id":7600935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDA5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7600935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif","html_url":"https://github.com/wrongtest-intellif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"wrongtest-intellif","id":7600935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDA5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7600935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif","html_url":"https://github.com/wrongtest-intellif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0fba0b657b5318081fc8a975eedc8f7bb81f1e77","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:update_min_of_div_rules","ref":"update_min_of_div_rules","sha":"0fba0b657b5318081fc8a975eedc8f7bb81f1e77","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"U

PR makes the following changes over TVMScript printer:\r\n\r\n1. Apply the new TVMScript printer to report and render the schedule error, and keeps effect same as old `AsTVMScriptWithDiagnostic`.\r\n2. Introduce more annotating and underlining interfaces for TVMScript ptrinter - `obj_to_annotate`: add comments to the final `StmtDoc` from `ObjectRef` - `obj_to_underline`: underline the final `Doc` from `ObjectRef` - `path_to_annotate`: add comments to the final `StmtDoc` from `ObjectPath`\r\n3. Beautify the underline logic by introducing the `underline_exempted`, to exempt some useless underlines, e.g. indent, comments and doc string.\r\n\r\ndemo:\r\n1. `*_to_annotate`: for function:\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef _func():\r\n  T.evaluate(0)\r\n  T.evaluate(1)\r\n  T.evaluate(2)\r\n  T.evaluate(3)\r\n  T.evaluate(4)\r\n  T.evaluate(5)\r\n  T.evaluate(6)\r\n  T.evaluate(7)\r\n```\r\nboth the results of \r\n```python\r\n_func.script(\r\n  path_to_annotate={\r\n    ObjectPath.root().attr(\"body\").attr(\"seq\").array_index(1): \"annotation 1\",\r\n    ObjectPath.root().attr(\"body\").attr(\"seq\").array_index(3): \"annotation 3\",\r\n    ObjectPath.root().attr(\"body\").attr(\"seq\").array_index(5): \"annotation 5\",\r\n    ObjectPath.root().attr(\"body\").attr(\"seq\").array_index(7): \"annotation 7\",\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```python\r\n_func.script(\r\n  obj_to_annotate={\r\n    _func.body.seq[1]: \"annotation 1\",\r\n    _func.body.seq[3]: \"annotation 3\",\r\n    _func.body.seq[5]: \"annotation 5\",\r\n    _func.body.seq[7]: \"annotation 7\",\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n```\r\nare\r\n```python\r\n# from tvm.script import tir as T\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main():\r\n  T.evaluate(0)\r\n  T.evaluate(1)  # annotation 1\r\n  T.evaluate(2)\r\n  T.evaluate(3)  # annotation 3\r\n  T.evaluate(4)\r\n  T.evaluate(5)  # annotation 5\r\n  T.evaluate(6)\r\n  T.evaluate(7)  # annotation 7\r\n```\r\n2. `obj_to_underline`: for function\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(a: T.int32, b: T.int32):\r\n  T.evaluate(a)\r\n  T.evaluate(b)\r\n  T.evaluate(a)\r\n  T.evaluate(b)\r\n  T.evaluate(a)\r\n  T.evaluate(b)\r\n```\r\nthe result of `func.script(obj_to_underline=[func.params[0]])`

CMSIS-NN backend will now partition quantized `int16` additions and multiplication operators and emit calls to `arm_elementwise_add_s16` and `arm_elementwise_mul_s16` respectively during codegen.\r\n\r\nBecause `arm_elementwise_mul_s16` and `arm_elementwise_add_s16` do not handle non-zero shift parameters at present, for non-zero zero point values (which map directly to shift in the CMSIS-NN backend) partitioning fails and we fall back on the regular C codegen path.\r\n\r\nThis patch also adds `int16` tests, including testing for the non-zero zero point edge case described above.","created_at":"2023-02-06T14:31:18Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T16:04:31Z","closed_at":"2023-02-08T16:04:31Z","merged_at":"2023-02-08T16:04:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e30e772a7395afa6674235e22943c433a1a3f32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13920/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13920/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13920/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/27ec6a2f97a7425772720f2e3c4bcd6d1c94f217","head":{"label":"FranklandJack:cmsis-nn-int16-mul-add-ops","ref":"cmsis-nn-int16-mul-add-ops","sha":"27ec6a2f97a7425772720f2e3c4bcd6d1c94f217","user":{"login":"FranklandJack","id":30410009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDEwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30410009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack","html_url":"https://github.com/FranklandJack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":598109967,"node_id":"R_kgDOI6ZvDw","name":"tvm","full_name":"FranklandJack/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FranklandJack","id":30410009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDEwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30410009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack","html_url":"https://github.com/FranklandJack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranklandJack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FranklandJack/tvm","description":"Open

the platforms with several OpenCL platforms (e.g. Intel CPU and NVidia GPU) it was possible to use OpenCL device only from one platform. And in case when Intel was the first in the platforms list than it wasn't possible to run model on NVidia GPU.\r\n\r\nIn this PR the init function was modified and now it is possible to use OpenCL devices from different platforms. In case when there are several GPU accelerators then it is possible to select one of them. You can use device id to select GPU device. On the code below the device names of two OpenCL devices are printed:\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\n\r\nprint(\"opencl 0: \", tvm.opencl(0).device_name)\r\nprint(\"opencl 1: \", tvm.opencl(1).device_name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case then the machine doesn't contain any GPUs then we will try to use CPU if OpenCL runtime is available.","created_at":"2023-02-06T13:06:15Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T10:20:49Z","closed_at":"2023-02-07T05:25:52Z","merged_at":"2023-02-07T05:25:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"7323e1d16f96a39ec29010c6562a36e3d38744ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13919/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13919/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13919/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0898855b59edf255b2411c5d06bc74ee7578cd55","head":{"label":"echuraev:echuraev/refactor_opencl_device_api","ref":"echuraev/refactor_opencl_device_api","sha":"0898855b59edf255b2411c5d06bc74ee7578cd55","user":{"login":"echuraev","id":5525113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev","html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317515420,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc1MTU0MjA=","name":"tvm","full_name":"echuraev/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"echuraev","id":5525113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev","html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev/tvm","description":"Open

PR is the bug fix reported in #13892. Initially, we mix the logic of `LetStmt` docsifying method with and without concise scoping. For example, in\r\n```python\r\nx = T.var(\"int32\")\r\nwith T.let(x, 0):\r\n```\r\n`x` in the `LetStmt` works as a right value, while in\r\n```python\r\nx: T.int32 = 0\r\n```\r\n`x` in the `LetStmt` works as a left value as result.\r\nOur old logic mixed them together to generate the wrong code for the first case.\r\nMeanwhile, during the fix, we found another bug in concise scoping check. For example, we have\r\n```python\r\nx = T.var(\"int32\")\r\ny = T.var(\"int32\")\r\nwith T.let(x, y):\r\n  with T.let(y, 0):\r\n```\r\nhere we should not output\r\n```python\r\nx = T.var(\"int32\")\r\ny = T.var(\"int32\")\r\nwith T.let(x, y):\r\n  y: int32 = 0\r\n```\r\nbecase this will define a new `y_1: int32 = 0` indeed, due the the variable shadowing logic of the parser, which is different from the `y` we define and refer to.\r\nOur concise scoping `v: ... = ...` should launch if and only if the `v` is never defined before.\r\nOtherwise, we use `with T.let(v, ...):` instead.","created_at":"2023-02-01T21:54:02Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T18:34:37Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T18:34:37Z","merged_at":"2023-02-03T18:34:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"98008c2d676dd14b43ec97050f935217c014dc49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13900/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13900/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13900/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/37ef3e31dcfcbf84739455bf773b89c143596792","head":{"label":"cyx-6:fix-letstmt","ref":"fix-letstmt","sha":"37ef3e31dcfcbf84739455bf773b89c143596792","user":{"login":"cyx-6","id":16838183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6","html_url":"https://github.com/cyx-6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444563899,"node_id":"R_kgDOGn-Buw","name":"tvm","full_name":"cyx-6/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cyx-6","id":16838183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6","html_url":"https://github.com/cyx-6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cyx-6/tvm","description":"Open

now there is a bad pattern in VM executable where when loading weights, we load serialized representation in memory, and then deserialize off the in-memory store without progressively freeing memory.\r\n\r\nThis is bad because if our weights take up ~ 5GB, then the serialized representation in memory takes up 5GB and the deserialized representation will take ~ 5 GB too. This means peak memory use for using the VM for execution is 2 * the size of the weight models.\r\n\r\nThis is bad, especially with some of the larger models out there today. \r\n\r\nThis fixes thing by using a stream from disk, and depending on the standard C file interface to buffer things for performant results. \r\n\r\nSome before and after graphs though loading and benchmarking a model with ~5GB weights:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13855451/215629180-4d07e0b4-cb6e-4535-88ce-f8b4346f8698.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13855451/215629115-a6ac9f3a-98e4-4d37-a7a3-fb9a6d26a3c3.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a draft since:\r\n- I've only tested loading weights, but we can see similar savings in other similar streams.\r\n- We need to make a decision on DMLC stream interface. The main issue is that a lot of existing code depends on DMLC stream interface, but DMLC itself is a header only library. We only have access to in-memory streams in the current state. The way I have gotten around this is by implementing a simple class.\r\n- We need to decide best way forward. The one in this PR is simple, though technically duplicates some code from DMLC core lib\r\n- Alternatives are including DMLC as dependency, adding to DMLC functionality and pulling those things changes, or get rid of DMLC stream interface entirely\r\n- This one is the simplest which is why I will do this for the

PR updates the order of arithmetic analyzer simplification, by adding a stage of canonical simplification at the very beginning so that every simplification always starts with a canonical round. This is because the rewrite simplification may destroy some PrimExpr property that the canonical simplification can make use of. Therefore, adding the canonical one in the front can maximize the use of canonical simplification.","created_at":"2023-01-30T20:09:51Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T14:34:39Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T14:34:39Z","merged_at":"2023-02-03T14:34:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb2315a266e01c2c1a0cf6fdcde326ea393387c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13875/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13875/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13875/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4df3068e8662e9ba0e80def514ff909f3b29601f","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-01-30-analyzer-simplification-starts-c","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-01-30-analyzer-simplification-starts-c","sha":"4df3068e8662e9ba0e80def514ff909f3b29601f","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

PR refactors the output of `assert_structural_equal`. Different from the directly printing mismatching nodes, in the old version, the improved one will print the whole scripts, with mismatching nodes underlined. And we print the `ObjectPath` to the mismatching nodes for further better debug. For example, we have following functions\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func1(a: T.handle, b: T.handle):\r\n  A = T.match_buffer(a, (128, 128))\r\n  B = T.match_buffer(b, (128, 128))\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func2(a: T.handle, b: T.handle):\r\n  A = T.match_buffer(a, (128, 128))\r\n  B = T.match_buffer(b, (128, 256))\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe log of `assert_structural_equal(func1, func2)` will be like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nValueError: StructuralEqual check failed, caused by lhs at <root>.buffer_map[b].shape[1].value:\r\n# from tvm.script import tir as T\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main(a: T.handle, b: T.handle):\r\n  A = T.match_buffer(a, (128, 128))\r\n  B = T.match_buffer(b, (128, 128))\r\n                              ^^^\r\n  T.evaluate(0)\r\nand rhs at <root>.buffer_map[b].shape[1].value:\r\n# from tvm.script import tir as T\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main(a: T.handle, b: T.handle):\r\n  A = T.match_buffer(a, (128, 128))\r\n  B = T.match_buffer(b, (128, 256))\r\n                              ^^^\r\n  T.evaluate(0)\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n```python\r\nValueError: StructuralEqual check failed, caused by lhs:\r\n128\r\nand rhs:\r\n256\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is not readable

commit adds new Relay operation `qnn.contrib_dense_pack` that supports different weights layout (`nn.dense` and `qnn.dense` do not support this attribute). This new operation is full analog of `nn.contrib_dense_pack` operation but in QNN space.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, current QNN Dense can achieve ~10x performance gain on Hexagon target without QNN canonicalization (through the use of `vrmpy` intrinsic).\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR includes slight performance improvement for `qnn.mul` (without QNN canonicalization).","created_at":"2023-01-27T11:32:01Z","updated_at":"2023-03-29T06:23:10Z","closed_at":"2023-02-02T14:21:01Z","merged_at":"2023-02-02T14:21:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"37e1a6862ca1bb77e33ca9c03e1365d50f468bd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/15e85e581238e1449a02160d170e941387ba40e3","head":{"label":"ibsidorenko:wo-qnn-perf-improvement","ref":"wo-qnn-perf-improvement","sha":"15e85e581238e1449a02160d170e941387ba40e3","user":{"login":"ibsidorenko","id":98739392,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeKkwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98739392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":485713421,"node_id":"R_kgDOHPNmDQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"ibsidorenko/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibsidorenko","id":98739392,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeKkwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98739392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko/tvm","description":"Open

the condition `constant.Shape().size() == index_map->initial_indices.size()` was used to decide if the constant that `TECompiler` finds has its layout write already applied or not. But for 1x1 conv2d case, there seems to be a case where the rank of the weight doesn't change after layout rewriting. For example, (1, 1, 32, 16) -> (16, 4, 2, 4). \r\n\r\nThis bug led to the same index map being applied twice on a constant during MS tuning and the final compilation.

used  workers=1 request=8`\r\n\r\n**Main problem description:**\r\nTuning of the _ARM Snapdragon 888 CPU_ architecture ends with an error above.\r\n\r\n**Suspected reason:**\r\nIncorrect (manual) determination of the number of threads. The number of threads is determined using _MaxConcurrency_ and returns 8 threads for this architecture, but the number of actually used threads is 4. This fix urges to use automatic determination of the number of threads by passing 'zero' as 'num_threads' attribute in 'TVMBackendParallelLaunch' to avoid the abovementioned discrepancy.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-26T18:44:59Z","updated_at":"2023-02-02T05:14:50Z","closed_at":"2023-02-02T05:14:50Z","merged_at":"2023-02-02T05:14:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"f0ea9e461a4bc056d320dafe651135c3a8357a34","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7a7a8f3c34f2ea54c3563b09844412e5dce884c5","head":{"label":"Deelvin:dbarinov/mt_random_engine_fix","ref":"dbarinov/mt_random_engine_fix","sha":"7a7a8f3c34f2ea54c3563b09844412e5dce884c5","user":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321290323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjEyOTAzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Deelvin/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin/tvm","description":"Open

ONNX frontend imports Unsqueeze as a sequence of expand_dims in Relay. This works fine when the axes are positive. \r\n\r\nHowever, for negative axes we need to compute the output rank and add the negative axis value to get its equivalent positive axis value. \r\n\r\nThis commit computes the output rank as the sum of the input rank of data and the number of axis in the axes array and convert negative axes to positive. \r\n\r\nThis commit also adds testcases for unsqueeze with negative axes and verifies the result with onnx runtime.

software cache management to enable DMA with cache bypass enabled.  DMA with cache bypass is an experimental feature requiring software management of the cache.   DMA with cache bypass enabled assumes that HexagonBuffer objects are not cached unless explicitly modified by the primfunc.  This PR adds cache flush and invalidation after HexagonBuffer allocation with `malloc` or copy with `memcpy` to uphold that assumption.  In addition, this PR adds logic to flush and invalidate the cache prior to a DMA with cache bypass enabled when the buffer in question has been modified by the primfunc.  The `test_matmul.py` test hits this case by performing layout transforms in global address space ahead of a DMA.  CC @csullivan with thanks for providing the test in

PR introduces the `CommentDoc` for comments printing and `DocStringDoc` for docstring printing. It enables to add free comments and docstring as `stmt` in printing, e.g.\r\n```python\r\n# comment 1\r\n# comment 2\r\n\"\"\"\r\ndocstring 1\r\ndocstring 2\r\n\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nThe free here means to not be bound to any `stmt`, but acts as a single `stmt`, similar to `ExprStmtDoc` for `ExprDoc`. \r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces an example for the `CommentDoc`, as follow up of #13819.\r\nIn the old printer, we always print a `# with T.block(\"root\"):`, when there is an implicit root block skipped when printing. For example,\r\n```\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main():\r\n  # with T.block(\"root\"):\r\n  a = T.alloc_buffer((128, 128))\r\n  for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n    with T.block(\"\"):\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\nWe bring this syntax reminder back in this PR.\r\nIn addition, we introduce a field of `ir_usage` and `print_headers` into the printer configuration, to support the printing of headers for `IRModule` and `PrimFunc`. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# from tvm.script import ir as I\r\n# from tvm.script import tir as T\r\n\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass Module():\r\n  @T.prim_func\r\n  def func():\r\n

PR is the follow up of #13813. We simplify the printing output of `T.allocate` with `T.decl_buffer`. For example, we have a code snippet as \r\n\r\n```python\r\nbuffer_data = T.allocate(...)\r\nbuffer = T.decl_buffer(..., data=buffer_data)\r\nT.evaluate(buffer_data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOriginally, we skip the `T.allocate` only if the var `buffer_data` defined by `T.allocate` is used only once by the following `T.decl_buffer`. This was due to the limitation of the old printer design. \r\n\r\nBut in the new printer, we may automatically replace the `buffer_data` with `buffer.data` if skipping the definition of `buffer_data`. We are able to link all `buffer_data` usages together. So the new output result will be like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbuffer =

PR updates the microTVM code to use Zephyr 3.2 and SDK 0.15.2. Az a result of this change, there are few other changes that are included in this PR:\r\n\r\n- this PR adds a launch script for Zephyr and Arduino template project to run the Project API server from a different Python ENV than TVM Python ENV.\r\n- For Zephyr, launch script uses global python3.8 which is where `west` is registered. However, for Arduino it uses a separate virtual ENV with python3 version that exists in the host.\r\n- removes `tests/micro/project_api/test_arduino_microtvm_api_server.py` since these tests where using arduino microtvm api server by importing it to TVM. We no longer support Arduino/Zephyr dependencies in TVM testing python ENV.\r\n- Disables a demo and test due to a CMSIS-NN bug: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/13856\r\n\r\nThere would be a follow up work to move zephyr to a completely separate virtual ENV.

PR extends the value accepted by USE_LIBBACKTRACE cmake variable. It adds ability to search pre-compile libbacktrace from system path or user-provided path.

Fail the build generation if libbacktrace is not found.\r\n- COMPILE: Build and link to libbacktrace from 3rdparty/libbacktrace. \r\n- \\<PATH\\>: Looking for the libbacktrace header and static lib from a user-provided path.
