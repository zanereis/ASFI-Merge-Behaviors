[testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java) from 1.16.2 to 1.16.3.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/releases\">testcontainers's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.16.3</h2>\n<h1>What's Changed</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<p>Testcontainers 1.16.3 includes many changes, but there are two key highlights in this release:</p>\n<h3>k3s module (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4582\">#4582</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/rnorth\"><code>@​rnorth</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kiview\"><code>@​kiview</code></a></h3>\n<p>We've had plenty of feedback from users wanting to use Testcontainers to help test Kubernetes components.\nIn particular, this is useful for people developing Kubernetes controllers/operators, who need something more than just a mocked Kubernetes API.\nIn this release we're bringing the k3s module, which gives you a neat way to spin up the <a href=\"https://k3s.io/\">K3S lightweight Kubernetes</a> inside of a container.\nWe believe that k3s hits a sweet spot for ease of use and performance, so is a good option for testing Kubernetes components.</p>\n<p>Now, launching a lightweight single-node Kubernetes cluster within your tests is easy as:</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code>K3sContainer k3s = new K3sContainer(DockerImageName.parse(&quot;rancher/k3s:v1.21.3-k3s1&quot;));\nk3s.start();\n<p>String kubeConfigYaml = k3s.getKubeConfigYaml();\nApiClient client = Config.fromConfig(new StringReader(kubeConfigYaml));</p>\n<p>// now use <code>client</code> to talk to your cluster!\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/k3s/\">the docs</a> to find out more!</p>\n<h3>Selenium 4 compatibility (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4914\">#4914</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/GannaChernyshova\"><code>@​GannaChernyshova</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tobiasstadler\"><code>@​tobiasstadler</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kiview\"><code>@​kiview</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rnorth\"><code>@​rnorth</code></a></h3>\n<p>Selenium 4 was <a href=\"https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/announcing-selenium-4/\">announced a while back</a>, but we needed to make some changes to Testcontainers' Selenium/Webdriver module for compatibility.\nWe're happy to announce that these changes have now been made, so you can now use Selenium 4 with Testcontainers!</p>\n<p>As part of this upgrade we have to drop compatibility with Selenium 2, but believe that this will not have any practical impact.</p>\n<h2>🚀 Features &amp; Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[Reusable mode] Don't log about starting container unnecessarily (<a

Your help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nBefore opening the pull request, please verify that\r\n* there is an open issue on the [Tika issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TIKA) which describes the problem or the improvement. We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\r\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\r\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\r\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\r\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\r\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\r\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch.

issue addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-3403\r\nIn addition to implementing the example file, it proposes the following improvements\r\n* minor upgrade of aws libraries to `1.11.1018`\r\n* adds a new configuration option for the AWS transcriber allowing client to write to a specific region cf. `transcribe.REGION`\r\n* makes use of [SelectObjectContentRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/model/SelectObjectContentRequest.html) which filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object (transcription) based on a simple Structured Query Language (SQL) statement. In the request, along with the SQL expression, we specify JSON as the data serialization format of the object. Amazon S3 uses this to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the specified SQL expression. In our case this means we ONLY return the transcription text. This dramatically (orders of magnitude) reduces the amount of data we egress from s3 to client.\r\n* the implementation will now automatically create the bucket (to store the transcription) if one does not already exist. This is a merely a utility feature.\r\n* introduces a LOT of exception handling and checks which will assist the client in debugging errors/anomalies. \r\n* Reformatted GoogleTranslator.java with 4-space indents.\r\n\r\nThanks about it.\r\n\r\nCC @rohan2810
