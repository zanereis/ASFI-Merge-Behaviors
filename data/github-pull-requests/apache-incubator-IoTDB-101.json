the given pathPattern will be used to find measurements.  \r\nReplace the origin flat measurement traversal with measurement traversal, which means the pattern will be used to only match measurement rather than component/submeasurement.\r\n\r\n1. Add MTree.getMeasurementPaths for deletion traversal\r\n2. Remove deleted mnode from mNodeCache after deleting timeseries\r\n3. Convert EntityMNodes without any measurement back to InternalMNode after deleting timeseries\r\n4. Fix vector related bug while deleting data\r\n5.

[awaitility](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility) from 4.0.2 to 4.1.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/blob/master/changelog.txt\">awaitility's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Changelog 4.1.0 (2021-05-08)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded to Scala from 2.13.3 to 2.13.5 (thanks to sullis for pull request)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Kotlin from 1.3.72 to 1.5.0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for fail-fast conditions. This is a special condition that, if fulfilled, will throw a &quot;org.awaitility.core.TerminalFailureException&quot; immediately, thus failing the test.\nThis is good when you have a condition that you know beforehand should never be fulfilled. So instead of waiting the full duration of a normal condition evaluation period, the test will fail\nfaster if this (fail fast) condition evaluates to true. For example:</p>\n<p>await().timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5)).failFast(() -&gt; orders.findById(1234).state == PAID).until(() -&gt; orders.findById(1234).state == CLOSED);</p>\n<p>This will fail-fast if the state of order 1234 is ever equal to &quot;PAID&quot; during the 5 second evaluation of the condition specified in &quot;until&quot;.\n(Thanks to Antony Stubbs for initial pull request) (issue 178)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Groovy from version 3.0.4 to 3.0.8</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog 4.0.3 (2020-05-19)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded to Scala 2.13.2 from 2.13.0 (thanks to sullis for pull request)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Kotlin extension to use Kotlin 1.3.72 (instead of 1.3.61)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved org.awaitility.core.ConditionEvaluationLogger to accept a consumer that decides how the logs are printed. You can use this to for example log intermediary values using slf4j instead of System.out.println or log to to disk or a data structure such as CopyOnWriteArrayList. For example:</p>\n<p>await().conditionEvaluationListener(new ConditionEvaluationLogger(log::info)).until(<!-- raw HTML omitted -->);</p>\n<p>This will log using a the logger &quot;log&quot; instead of printing to the console.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed problems with test dependencies in pom.xml</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Groovy from 2.5.7 to 3.0.4</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/ce63847af2dc101217f9812615970be07abb4a51\"><code>ce63847</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release awaitility-4.1.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/8c1c1868516d170ea3140ec2303d80ccc791a04c\"><code>8c1c186</code></a> Preparing changelog for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/3f78426f8692e10b6566ac7748f8a7a806c3c273\"><code>3f78426</code></a> Upgrading Junit and pax-exam</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/cba83fca80debe23a7e73ddea346335021b86203\"><code>cba83fc</code></a> Fixing link to travis [ci skip]</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/8abe43751cf3176da0f4604e23f0f84777e5ec42\"><code>8abe437</code></a> Upgrading spock to 2.0-M5-groovy-3.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/50a01fd6940f165d9df72bd30b6e79b8e53d39b2\"><code>50a01fd</code></a> Upgraded Groovy from version 3.0.4 to 3.0.8</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/5f86cc4310d941927001b566077434332ae7a248\"><code>5f86cc4</code></a> Fixed changelog version number for scala upgrade</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/24ad19d93b02624cb15c0cf59c4603f8158c006d\"><code>24ad19d</code></a> Added fail-fast condition support</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/88f0d0f2fc039651188907a6b3435b7258f46e0f\"><code>88f0d0f</code></a> Fixed failing test on Java 8</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/6443cc2b72e3469691bec983110d58d0585ef1ad\"><code>6443cc2</code></a> Upgrading dokka to 1.4.32</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/compare/awaitility-4.0.2...awaitility-4.1.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.awaitility:awaitility&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.0.2&new-version=4.1.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/releases\">testcontainers's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.16.0</h2>\n<h1>What's Changed</h1>\n<p>Testcontainers 1.16.0 is here! 🎉</p>\n<p>This release brings many small fixes and improvements; among them:</p>\n<h3>Better M1 Mac compatibility</h3>\n<p>Users of M1 Mac will be pleased to know that Testcontainers now falls back to pulling x86_64 images when ARM64 images are unavailable, meaning that Docker's QEMU compatibility mode will be used to run the image. It's not perfect - not every image runs under QEMU. However, this allows Testcontainers users with M1 Macs to use more images than they could previously.</p>\n<p>If possible, users should use recently published images for their dependencies which have a native ARM64 variant, rather than relying on QEMU emulation.</p>\n<h3>Startup performance and reliability improvements</h3>\n<p>Some issues affecting container startup time and reliability (especially with Docker for Windows) have been fixed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this release uses the latest version of <code>docker-java</code> and uses an Apache HttpClient5 transport by default.

Jackson dependency to <code>2.9.10.3</code>.</li>\n<li>Fixes an issue when using Java 9+ <code>Map.of</code> with <code>JacksonDeserializer</code> that resulted in an <code>NullPointerException</code>.</li>\n<li>Fixes an issue that prevented the <code>jjwt-gson</code> .jar's seralizer/deserializer implementation from being detected automatically.</li>\n<li>Ensures service implementations are now loaded from the context class loader, Services.class.classLoader, and the system classloader, the first classloader with a service wins, and the others are ignored. This mimics how <code>Classes.forName()</code> works, and how JJWT attempted to auto-discover various implementations in previous versions.</li>\n<li>Fixes a minor error in the <code>Claims#getIssuedAt</code> JavaDoc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>0.11.0</h3>\n<p>This minor release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Adds <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson\">Google's Gson</a> as a natively supported JSON parser. Installation instructions\nhave been updated and new <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt#json-gson\">JJWT Gson usage guidelines</a> have been added.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updates the Jackson dependency version to <a href=\"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9#patches\">2.9.10</a>\nto address three security vulnerabilities in Jackson.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code>JwtParserBuilder</code> interface has been added and is the recommended way of creating an immutable and thread-safe JwtParser instance.  Mutable methods in <code>JwtParser</code> will be removed before v1.0.\nMigration to the new signatures is straightforward, for example:</p>\n<p>Previous Version:</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code> Jwts.parser()\n     .requireAudience(&quot;string&quot;)\n     .parse(jwtString)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Current Version:</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code>Jwts.parserBuilder()\n    .requireAudience(&quot;string&quot;)\n    .build()\n    .parse(jwtString)\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

dangerous that IoTDBCompleteIT uses HashVirtualPartitioner's setStorageGroupNum method to set the number of virtual storage groups, because VirtualStorageGroupManager initializes StorageGroupProcessor array when it's constructed and the call of setStorageGroupNum method will cause sg num conflicts between HashVirtualPartitioner and VirtualStorageGroupManager, then throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. So, i remove the setStorageGroupNum method of HashVirtualPartitioner.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the restart of StorageEngine in EnvironmentUtils.restartDaemon() is confusing because the start method only start timed service except the initialization of storage groups. So, i move the initialization of storage groups in StorageEngine from constructor to start method.
