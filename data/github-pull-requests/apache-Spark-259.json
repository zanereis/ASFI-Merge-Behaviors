What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, ORC's `inferSchema` is implemented as randomly choosing one ORC file and reading its schema. \r\n\r\nThis PR follows the behavior of Parquet, it implements merge schemas logic by reading all ORC files in parallel through a spark job. \r\n\r\nUsers can enable merge schema by `spark.read.orc(\"xxx\").option(\"mergeSchema\", \"true\")` or by setting `spark.sql.orc.mergeSchema` to `true`, the prior one has higher priority.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\ntested by UT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.1, we hit a correctness bug. When reading a Hive serde parquet table with the native parquet data source, and the actual file schema doesn't match the table schema in Hive metastore(only upper/lower case difference), the query returns 0 results.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that, the parquet reader is case sensitive. If we push down filters with column names that don't match the file physical schema case-sensitively, no data will be returned.\r\n\r\nTo fix this bug, there were 2 solutions proposed at that time:\r\n1. Add a config to optionally disable parquet filter pushdown, and make parquet column pruning case insensitive.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16797\r\n\r\n2. Infer the actual schema from data files, when reading Hive serde table with native data source. A config is provided to disable it.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17229\r\n\r\nSolution 2 was accepted and merged to Spark 2.1.1\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.4, we refactored the parquet data source a little:\r\n1. do parquet filter pushdown with the actual file schema.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21696\r\n\r\n2. make parquet filter pushdown case insensitive.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22197\r\n\r\n3. make parquet column pruning case insensitive.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22148\r\n\r\nWith these patches, the correctness bug in Spark 2.1 no longer exists, and the schema inference becomes unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTo be safe, this PR just changes the default value to NEVER_INFER, so that users can set it back to INFER_AND_SAVE. If we don't receive any bug reports for it, we can remove the related code in the next release.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently even Broadcast thread is timed out, Jobs are not aborted and it will run in the background.\r\n As per current design the broadcast future will be waiting till the timeout for the job result, which needs to be broadcasted , when the broadcast future timeout happens the\r\njob tasks running in the background will not getting killed and it will continue running in background.\r\n\r\nAs part of solution we shall get the jobs based on execution id from app-status store and cancel the respective job before throwing out the Future time out exception,\r\nthis can help to terminate the job and its respective tasks promptly when Timeout-exception happens, this will also save the additional resources getting utilized even after timeout exception thrown from driver.\r\n\r\nAfter fix In Spark web UI  the jobs are getting failed once timeout error occurs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually\r\nBefore fix\r\n```scala> spark.sqlContext.setConf(\"spark.sql.broadcastTimeout\",\"2\")\r\nscala> val df1 = spark.range(0,10000,1,10000).selectExpr(\"id%10000 as key1\", \"id as value1\")\r\ndf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [key1: bigint, value1: bigint]\r\n\r\nscala> val df2 = spark.range(0,10000,1,10000).selectExpr(\"id%10000 as key2\", \"id as value2\")\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [key2: bigint, value2: bigint]\r\n\r\nscala> val inner = df1.join(df2,col(\"key1\")===col(\"key2\")).select(col(\"key1\"),col(\"value2\")).collect \r\n```\r\nActual Result : Timeout exception thrown and still task will be running in background, in spark web ui also the task execution will be in progress and after execution the job  status shown successful, please refer attachments for more details.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12999161/54067638-53b65100-4268-11e9-97dc-66c1a81e308e.png)\r\n Web

even in UI the job status displayed as failed.\r\n![brcast_fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12999161/54067676-b7d91500-4268-11e9-8b65-0a9a48006327.PNG)\r\n\r\nWeb

trying to kill executors either due to dynamic allocation or blacklisting\r\n\r\nRecently, a few spark users in the organization have reported that their jobs were getting stuck. On further analysis, it was found out that there exist two independent deadlocks and either of them occur under different circumstances. The screenshots for these two deadlocks are attached here. \r\n\r\nWe were able to reproduce the deadlocks with the following piece of code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.fs.{FileSystem, Path}\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\n// Simple example of Word Count in Scala\r\nobject ScalaWordCount {\r\ndef main(args: Array[String]) {\r\n\r\nif (args.length < 2) {\r\nSystem.err.println(\"Usage: ScalaWordCount <inputFilesURI> <outputFilesUri>\")\r\nSystem.exit(1)\r\n}\r\n\r\nval conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"Scala Word Count\")\r\nval sc = new SparkContext(conf)\r\n\r\n// get the input file uri\r\nval inputFilesUri = args(0)\r\n\r\n// get the output file uri\r\nval outputFilesUri = args(1)\r\n\r\nwhile (true) {\r\nval textFile = sc.textFile(inputFilesUri)\r\nval counts = textFile.flatMap(line => line.split(\" \"))\r\n.map(word => {if (TaskContext.get.partitionId == 5 && TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0) throw new Exception(\"Fail for blacklisting\") else (word, 1)})\r\n.reduceByKey(_ + _)\r\ncounts.saveAsTextFile(outputFilesUri)\r\nval conf: Configuration = new Configuration()\r\nval path: Path = new Path(outputFilesUri)\r\nval hdfs: FileSystem = FileSystem.get(conf)\r\nhdfs.delete(path, true)\r\n}\r\n\r\nsc.stop()\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure that the deadlock surfaces up soon enough, I also added a small delay in the Spark code here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/BlacklistTracker.scala#L256\r\n\r\n```\r\nexecutorIdToFailureList.remove(exec)\r\nupdateNextExpiryTime()\r\nThread.sleep(2000)\r\nkillBlacklistedExecutor(exec)\r\n```\r\nAlso make sure that the following configs are set when launching the above spark job:\r\n**spark.blacklist.enabled=true\r\nspark.blacklist.killBlacklistedExecutors=true\r\nspark.blacklist.application.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor=1**\r\n\r\nScreenshots for deadlock between task-result-getter-thread and spark-dynamic-executor-allocation thread:\r\n<img width=\"1417\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-26 at 4 10 26 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22228190/54062129-de943e80-41c9-11e9-8c62-cc810b7be74d.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1416\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-26 at 4 10 48 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22228190/54062135-e653e300-41c9-11e9-99a2-7569045487bd.png\">\r\n\r\nScreenshots for deadlock between task-result-getter-thread and dispatcher-event-loop thread:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1417\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-26 at 4 11 11 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22228190/54062148-fc61a380-41c9-11e9-9014-9199b46863d8.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1417\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-26 at 4 11 26 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22228190/54062150-01beee00-41ca-11e9-8d0b-a7a1836a4e11.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are two deadlocks as a result of the interplay between three different threads:\r\n\r\n**task-result-getter thread**\r\n\r\n**spark-dynamic-executor-allocation thread**\r\n\r\n**dispatcher-event-loop thread(makeOffers())**\r\n\r\nThe fix for the deadlock between dynamic allocation thread and result getter thread involves moving the method isExecutorBusy outside of the lock CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.this.\r\n\r\nThe fix for the deadlock between event loop thread and result getter thread involves removing synchronized on CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.this. The same synchronization has been replaced by a dummy lock to ensure synchronization between dynamic allocation thread and event loop thread in order to fix https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19757 but avoid the deadlock scenario which was introduced by the code changes for the above JIRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe code used to reproduce the deadlock issue is documented

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore a Kafka consumer gets assigned with partitions, its offset will contain 0 partitions. However, runContinuous will still run and launch a Spark job having 0 partitions. In this case, there is a race that epoch may interrupt the query execution thread after `lastExecution.toRdd`, and either `epochEndpoint.askSync[Unit](StopContinuousExecutionWrites)` or the next `runContinuous` will get interrupted unintentionally.\r\n\r\nTo handle this case, this PR has the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Clean up the resources in `queryExecutionThread.runUninterruptibly`. This may increase the waiting time of `stop` but should be minor because the operations here are very fast (just sending an RPC message in the same process and stopping a very simple thread).\r\n- Clear the interrupted status at the end so that it won't impact the `runContinuous` call. We may clear the interrupted status set by `stop`, but it doesn't affect the query termination because `runActivatedStream` will check `state` and exit accordingly.\r\n\r\nI also updated the clean up codes to make sure exceptions thrown from `epochEndpoint.askSync[Unit](StopContinuousExecutionWrites)` won't stop the clean up.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins","created_at":"2019-03-08T23:39:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-09T22:31:18Z","closed_at":"2019-03-09T22:29:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3402322a483e2aef09a2f6ccab381ca664bce45c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c7f25361c40cf6e309e682c84eaa07e46494c5d4","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-27111","ref":"SPARK-27111","sha":"c7f25361c40cf6e309e682c84eaa07e46494c5d4","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark SQL performs whole-stage code generation to speed up query execution. There are two steps to it:\r\n- Java source code is generated from the physical query plan on the driver. A single version of the source code is generated from a query plan, and sent to all executors.\r\n  - It's compiled to bytecode on the driver to catch compilation errors before sending to executors, but currently only the generated source code gets sent to the executors. The bytecode compilation is for fail-fast only.\r\n- Executors receive the generated source code and compile to bytecode, then the query runs like a hand-written Java program.\r\n\r\nIn this model, there's an implicit assumption about the driver and executors being run on similar platforms. Some code paths accidentally embedded platform-dependent object layout information into the generated code, such as:\r\n```java\r\nPlatform.putLong(buffer, /* offset */ 24, /* value */ 1);\r\n```\r\nThis code expects a field to be at offset +24 of the `buffer` object, and sets a value to that field.\r\nBut whole-stage code generation generally uses platform-dependent information from the driver. If the object layout is significantly different on the driver and executors, the generated code can be reading/writing to wrong offsets on the executors, causing all kinds of data corruption.\r\n\r\nOne code pattern that leads to such problem is the use of `Platform.XXX` constants in generated code, e.g. `Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET`.\r\n\r\nBad:\r\n```scala\r\nval baseOffset = Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET\r\n// codegen template:\r\ns\"Platform.putLong($buffer, $baseOffset, $value);\"\r\n```\r\nThis will embed the value of `Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET` on the driver into the generated code.\r\n\r\nGood:\r\n```scala\r\nval baseOffset = \"Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET\"\r\n// codegen template:\r\ns\"Platform.putLong($buffer, $baseOffset, $value);\"\r\n```\r\nThis will generate the offset symbolically -- `Platform.putLong(buffer, Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET, value)`, which will be able to pick up the correct value on the executors.\r\n\r\nCaveat: these offset constants are declared as runtime-initialized `static final` in Java, so they're not compile-time constants from the Java language's perspective. It does lead to a slightly increased size of the generated code, but this is necessary for correctness.\r\n\r\nNOTE: there can be other patterns that generate platform-dependent code on the driver which is invalid on the executors. e.g. if the endianness is different between the driver and the executors, and if some generated code makes strong assumption about endianness, it would also be problematic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test suite `WholeStageCodegenSparkSubmitSuite`. This test suite needs to set the driver's extraJavaOptions to force the driver and executor use different Java object layouts, so it's run as an actual SparkSubmit job.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Kris Mok

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark SQL performs whole-stage code generation to speed up query execution. There are two steps to it:\r\n- Java source code is generated from the physical query plan on the driver. A single version of the source code is generated from a query plan, and sent to all executors.\r\n  - It's compiled to bytecode on the driver to catch compilation errors before sending to executors, but currently only the generated source code gets sent to the executors. The bytecode compilation is for fail-fast only.\r\n- Executors receive the generated source code and compile to bytecode, then the query runs like a hand-written Java program.\r\n\r\nIn this model, there's an implicit assumption about the driver and executors being run on similar platforms. Some code paths accidentally embedded platform-dependent object layout information into the generated code, such as:\r\n```java\r\nPlatform.putLong(buffer, /* offset */ 24, /* value */ 1);\r\n```\r\nThis code expects a field to be at offset +24 of the `buffer` object, and sets a value to that field.\r\nBut whole-stage code generation generally uses platform-dependent information from the driver. If the object layout is significantly different on the driver and executors, the generated code can be reading/writing to wrong offsets on the executors, causing all kinds of data corruption.\r\n\r\nOne code pattern that leads to such problem is the use of `Platform.XXX` constants in generated code, e.g. `Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET`.\r\n\r\nBad:\r\n```scala\r\nval baseOffset = Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET\r\n// codegen template:\r\ns\"Platform.putLong($buffer, $baseOffset, $value);\"\r\n```\r\nThis will embed the value of `Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET` on the driver into the generated code.\r\n\r\nGood:\r\n```scala\r\nval baseOffset = \"Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET\"\r\n// codegen template:\r\ns\"Platform.putLong($buffer, $baseOffset, $value);\"\r\n```\r\nThis will generate the offset symbolically -- `Platform.putLong(buffer, Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET, value)`, which will be able to pick up the correct value on the executors.\r\n\r\nCaveat: these offset constants are declared as runtime-initialized `static final` in Java, so they're not compile-time constants from the Java language's perspective. It does lead to a slightly increased size of the generated code, but this is necessary for correctness.\r\n\r\nNOTE: there can be other patterns that generate platform-dependent code on the driver which is invalid on the executors. e.g. if the endianness is different between the driver and the executors, and if some generated code makes strong assumption about endianness, it would also be problematic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test suite `WholeStageCodegenSparkSubmitSuite`. This test suite needs to set the driver's extraJavaOptions to force the driver and executor use different Java object layouts, so it's run as an actual SparkSubmit job.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Kris Mok

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn PR, I propose to refactor the `parse()` method of `Iso8601DateFormatter`/`Iso8601DateFormatter` and `toInstantWithZoneId` of `toInstantWithZoneId` to achieve the following:\r\n- Avoid unnecessary conversion of parsed input to `java.time.Instant` before converting it to micros and days. Necessary information exists in `ZonedDateTime` already, and micros/days can be extracted from the former one.\r\n- Avoid additional extraction of LocalTime from parsed object, more precisely, double query of `TemporalQueries.localTime` from `temporalAccessor`.\r\n- Avoid additional extraction of zone id from parsed object, in particular, double query of `TemporalQueries.offset()`.\r\n- Using `ZoneOffset.UTC` instead of `ZoneId.of` in `DateFormatter`. This allows to avoid looking for zone offset by zone id.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy existing test suite `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `TimestampFormatterSuite` and `DateFormatterSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-08T21:56:22Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T15:57:20Z","closed_at":"2019-03-12T00:04:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3762c891253a1a2a2bd844ded7458d53bd66d584","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cfe03542cb5477896e6f3765ba8754a7a781ef72","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:query-localtime","ref":"query-localtime","sha":"cfe03542cb5477896e6f3765ba8754a7a781ef72","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis moves parsing `CREATE TABLE ... USING` statements into catalyst. Catalyst produces logical plans with the parsed information and those plans are converted to v1 `DataSource` plans in `DataSourceAnalysis`.\r\n\r\nThis prepares for adding v2 create plans that should receive the information parsed from SQL without being translated to v1 plans first.\r\n\r\nThis also makes it possible to parse in catalyst instead of breaking the parser across the abstract `AstBuilder` in catalyst and `SparkSqlParser` in core.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the [mailing list thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/54f4e1929ceb9a2b0cac7cb058000feb8de5d6c667b2e0950804c613@%3Cdev.spark.apache.org%3E).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis uses existing tests to catch regressions. This introduces no behavior

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFurther load increases in our production environment have shown that even the read locks can cause some contention, since they contain a mechanism that turns a read lock into an exclusive lock if a writer has been starved out.  This PR reduces the potential for lock contention even further than https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23833.  Additionally, it uses more idiomatic scala than the previous implementation.\r\n\r\n@cloud-fan & @gatorsmile This is a relatively minor improvement to the previous CacheManager changes.  At this point, I think we finally are doing the minimum possible amount of locking.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHas been tested on a live system where the blocking was causing major issues and it is working well.\r\nCacheManager has no explicit unit test but is used in many places internally as part of the SharedState.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-08T18:53:50Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T03:54:01Z","closed_at":"2019-03-15T02:16:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc25377f9d916190f32ab5f850664367f896d782","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1bb2511a83ea847b798943fe8519ba03b790910b","head":{"label":"DaveDeCaprio:read-locks-master","ref":"read-locks-master","sha":"1bb2511a83ea847b798943fe8519ba03b790910b","user":{"login":"DaveDeCaprio","id":841146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79563979,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTU2Mzk3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"DaveDeCaprio/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveDeCaprio","id":841146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, R's Scala codes happened to refer Python's Scala codes for code deduplications. It's a bit odd. For instance, when we face an exception from R, it shows python related code path, which makes confusing to debug. It should rather have one code base and R's and Python's should share.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n\r\n1. Make a `SocketAuthServer` and move `PythonServer` so that `PythonRDD` and `RRDD` can share it.\r\n2. Move `readRDDFromFile` and `readRDDFromInputStream` into `JavaRDD`.\r\n3. Reuse `RAuthHelper` and remove `RSocketAuthHelper` in `RRDD`.\r\n4. Rename `getEncryptionEnabled` to `isEncryptionEnabled` while I am here.\r\n\r\nSo, now, the places below:\r\n\r\n- `sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/api/r`\r\n- `core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/api/r`\r\n- `mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/r`\r\n\r\ndon't refer Python's Scala codes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover this.","created_at":"2019-03-08T07:22:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:44Z","closed_at":"2019-03-10T06:10:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f448e9792d4cd2391d5e1f832f9e0d61699a1cea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e41ca5e8a49588507cd6445da8e8e9f2686dcd2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-27102","ref":"SPARK-27102","sha":"9e41ca5e8a49588507cd6445da8e8e9f2686dcd2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new SQL function 'xxhash64' for getting a 64-bit hash of an arbitrary number of columns.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to exactly mimic the 32-bit `hash`, which uses\r\nMurmurHash3. The name is designed to be more future-proof than the\r\n'hash', by indicating the exact algorithm used, similar to md5 and the\r\nsha hashes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe tests for the existing `hash` function were duplicated to run with `xxhash64`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-08T03:11:09Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T10:46:35Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T08:37:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"baa0ca2ccfd6706479ed8cc9642e411e262b6d12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bde21bbb5afb56cb20e6725d9dd06eabf2a23e49","head":{"label":"huonw:hash64","ref":"hash64","sha":"bde21bbb5afb56cb20e6725d9dd06eabf2a23e49","user":{"login":"huonw","id":1203825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw","html_url":"https://github.com/huonw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158619021,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTg2MTkwMjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"huonw/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huonw","id":1203825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw","html_url":"https://github.com/huonw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huonw/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Barrier TaskSet has a hard requirement that tasks can only be launched\r\nin a single resourceOffers round with enough slots(or sufficient resources), but\r\ncan not be guaranteed even if with enough slots due to task locality delay scheduling.\r\nSo, it is very likely that Barrier TaskSet gets a chunk of sufficient resources after\r\nall the trouble, but let it go easily just because one of pending tasks can not be\r\nscheduled. Futhermore, it causes severe resource competition between TaskSets and jobs\r\nand introduce unclear semantic for DynamicAllocation.\r\n\r\nThis pr trys to introduce WorkerOffer reservation mechanism for Barrier TaskSet, which\r\nallows Barrier TaskSet to reserve WorkerOffer in each resourceOffers round, and launch\r\ntasks at the same time once it accumulate the sufficient resource. In this way, we\r\nrelax the requirement of resources for the Barrier TaskSet.\r\n\r\nBesides, we have two features along with WorkerOffer reservation mechanism:\r\n\r\nTo avoid the deadlock which may be introuduced by serveral Barrier TaskSets holding the reserved WorkerOffers for a long time, we'll ask Barrier TaskSets to force releasing part of reserved WorkerOffers\r\non demand. So, it is highly possible that each Barrier TaskSet would be launched in the end.\r\n\r\nBarrier TaskSet could replace old high level locality reserved WorkerOffer with new low level locality WorkerOffer during the time it wating for sufficient resources, to perform better locality at the end.\r\n\r\nTo integrate with DynamicAllocation:\r\n\r\nThe possible effective way I can imagine is that adding new event, e.g.\r\nExecutorReservedEvent, ExecutorReleasedEvent, which behaved like busy executor with\r\nrunning tasks or idle executor without running tasks. Thus, ExecutorAllocationManager\r\nwould not let the executor go if it reminds of there're some reserved resource on that\r\nexecutor.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisted and added some, needs to add more.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-07T15:20:08Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T14:19:43Z","closed_at":"2020-01-02T00:07:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1685a5fda0cef885fb7ebb0f787fdb1a44d5ebad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an optional solution for #22806 .\r\n\r\n#21131 firstly implement that a previous successful completed task from zombie TaskSetManager could also succeed the active TaskSetManager, which based on an assumption that an active TaskSetManager always exists for that stage when this happen. But that's not always true as an active TaskSetManager may haven't been created when a previous task succeed, and this is the reason why #22806 hit the issue.\r\n\r\nThis pr extends #21131 's behavior by adding stageIdToFinishedPartitions into TaskSchedulerImpl, which recording the finished partition whenever a task(from zombie or active) succeed. Thus, a later created active TaskSetManager could also learn about the finished partition by looking into stageIdToFinishedPartitions and won't launch any duplicate tasks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an optional solution for #22806 .\r\n\r\n#21131 firstly implement that a previous successful completed task from zombie TaskSetManager could also succeed the active TaskSetManager, which based on an assumption that an active TaskSetManager always exists for that stage when this happen. But that's not always true as an active TaskSetManager may haven't been created when a previous task succeed, and this is the reason why #22806 hit the issue.\r\n\r\nThis pr extends #21131 's behavior by adding stageIdToFinishedPartitions into TaskSchedulerImpl, which recording the finished partition whenever a task(from zombie or active) succeed. Thus, a later created active TaskSetManager could also learn about the finished partition by looking into stageIdToFinishedPartitions and won't launch any duplicate tasks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

streaming-programming-guide.md, as follows:\r\n\r\nSetting the max receiving rate - If the cluster resources is not large enough for the streaming\r\napplication to process data as fast as it is being received, the receivers can be rate limited\r\nby setting a maximum rate limit in terms of records / sec.\r\nSee the configuration parameters\r\nspark.streaming.receiver.maxRate for receivers and spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition\r\nfor Direct Kafka approach. In Spark 1.5, we have introduced a feature called backpressure **_**that\r\neliminate the need to set this rate limit**_**, as Spark Streaming automatically figures out the\r\nrate limits and dynamically adjusts them if the processing conditions change. This backpressure\r\ncan be enabled by setting the configuration parameter\r\nspark.streaming.backpressure.enabled to true.\r\n\r\nI think we should be more rigorous. Setting the rate limit when restarting task is very necessary.The first batch may be processing all the time and can not run normally when the first batch of data is very large for Direct Kafka approach .\r\n\r\nIf we know how the task works ,for example, processing time/maximum amount of data that can be processed per batch, setting a reasonable rate can make the task more stable.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-07T04:00:58Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T13:55:16Z","closed_at":"2019-03-12T13:55:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1ede152281ba044e1a39eb136e393715907062e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c1a3fb27bd67d64aca7fb0972d5a9a9a49619334","head":{"label":"hehuiyuan:hehuiyuan-patch-1","ref":"hehuiyuan-patch-1","sha":"c1a3fb27bd67d64aca7fb0972d5a9a9a49619334","user":{"login":"hehuiyuan","id":18002496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAyNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18002496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/hehuiyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hehuiyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a543f917e086baa1151475dcb2d122d83b18a619","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn streaming-programming-guide.md, as follows:\r\n\r\n*Setting the max receiving rate* - If the cluster resources is not large enough for the

[configuration parameters](configuration.html#spark-streaming)\r\n  `spark.streaming.receiver.maxRate` for receivers and `spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition`\r\n  for Direct Kafka approach. In Spark 1.5, we have introduced a feature called *backpressure* that\r\n  eliminate the need to set this rate limit, as Spark Streaming automatically figures out the\r\n  rate limits and dynamically adjusts them if the processing conditions change. This backpressure\r\n  can be enabled by setting the [configuration parameter](configuration.html#spark-streaming)\r\n  `spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled` to `true`.\r\n\r\nI think we should be more rigorous.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a very minor pr to include the usage example to generate output for single test in SQLQueryTestSuite. I tried to deduce it from the existing example and ran into a scenario \r\nwhere sbt is simply looping to run the same test over and over again. Here is the example\r\nof running a single test.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"~sql/test-only *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z inline-table.sql\"\r\n```\r\nI tried to generate the output for a single test by prepending `SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1` like following\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"~sql/test-only *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z describe.sql\"\r\n```\r\nIn this case i found that sbt is looping trying to run describe.sql over and over again as we are running the test in on continuous mode (because of `~` prefix ) where it detects a change in \r\nthe generated result file which in turn triggers a build and test. I have included an example where\r\nwe don't run it in continuous mode when generating the output. Hopefully it saves other developers some time.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nVerified manually in my dev setup.","created_at":"2019-03-06T23:56:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T04:29:30Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T04:08:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81e1c1f9d8010acda07732b3a967165b9bbbe17e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23995/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23995/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23995/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/53ec11b3a025dce8b113f278b67be65f38943c7f","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:dkb_sqlquerytest_usage","ref":"dkb_sqlquerytest_usage","sha":"53ec11b3a025dce8b113f278b67be65f38943c7f","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHive 3.1.1's `CommandProcessor` have 2 changes:\r\n1. [HIVE-17626](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-17626)(Hive 3.0.0) add ReExecDriver. So the current code path is: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/02bbe977abaf7006b845a7e99d612b0235aa0025/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L736-L742\r\nWe can disable `hive.query.reexecution.enabled` to workaround this change.\r\n2. [HIVE-18238](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18238)(Hive 3.0.0) changed the `Driver.close()` function return type. We can workaround it by ` driver.getClass.getMethod(\"close\").invoke(driver)`\r\n\r\nSo Hive 3.1 metastore could support `HiveClientImpl.runHive` after this pr.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit

succeed)\r\n\r\nDebatable choice:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if RDD API is the right place to put the depth computation method. The advantage of it is that it allows to access driver max result size, and rdd number of partitions, to set default arguments for the method. Semantically, such a method might belong to something like org.apache.spark.util.Utils

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently in the grammar file, we have the joinType rule defined as following : \r\n```\r\njoinType\r\n    : INNER?\r\n   ....\r\n   ....\r\n    | LEFT SEMI\r\n    | LEFT? ANTI\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\nThe keyword LEFT is optional for ANTI join even though its not optional for SEMI join. When\r\nusing data frame interface join type \"anti\" is not allowed. The allowed types are \"left_anti\" or \r\n\"leftanti\" for anti joins. ~~In this PR, i am making the LEFT keyword mandatory for ANTI joins so \r\nit aligns better with the LEFT SEMI join in the grammar file and also the join types allowed from dataframe api.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR makes LEFT optional for SEMI join in .g4 and add \"semi\" and \"anti\" join types from dataframe. \r\n\r\n~~I have not opened any JIRA for this as probably we may need some discussion to see if\r\nwe are going to address this or not.~~\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nModified the join type

CatalogImpl.refreshTable() method is invoked against a cached table, this method would first uncache corresponding query in the shared state cache manager, and then cache it back to refresh the cache copy. \r\n\r\nHowever, the table was recached with only 'table name'. The database name will be missed. Therefore, if cached table is not on the default database, the recreated cache may refer to a different table. For example, we may see the cached table name in driver's storage page will be changed after table refreshing. \r\n\r\nActually, CatalogImpl registers cache with received table name. Therefore, I would like to propose aligning the behavior. RefreshTable method should reuse the received table name instead. \r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAlign the behavior of CatalogImpl.cacheTable and CatalogImpl.refreshTable, such that they both register query with received tableName. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested with existing unit tests. \r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to have one base R runner. \r\n\r\nIn the high level,\r\n\r\nPreviously, it had `ArrowRRunner` and it inherited `RRunner`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n└── RRunner\r\n    └── ArrowRRunner\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, now it has a `BaseRRunner`, and `ArrowRRunner` and `RRunner` inherit `BaseRRunner`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n└── BaseRRunner\r\n    ├── ArrowRRunner\r\n    └── RRunner\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way is consistent with Python's.\r\n\r\nIn more details, see below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass BaseRRunner[IN, OUT] {\r\n\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI would like to refactor `limit.scala` slightly and introduce common trait `LimitExec` for `CollectLimitExec` and `BaseLimitExec` (`LocalLimitExec` and `GlobalLimitExec`). This will allow to distinguish those operators from others, and to get the `limit` value without casting to concrete class.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nby existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n `start-shuffle-service.sh`  was only used by Mesos  before `start-mesos-shuffle-service.sh`.\r\nObviously, `start-mesos-shuffle-service.sh` solves some problems, it is better than  `start-shuffle-service.sh`.\r\nSo now we should delete `start-shuffle-service.sh` in case users use it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

Currently, binary type, float type, nested struct type and array type are not supported.\r\n\r\n**For map and nested struct types:**\r\n\r\n it's expected to be unsupported per Spark's arrow optimization.\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"serve-Arrow\" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unsupported data type: map<string,double>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"serve-Arrow\" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unsupported data type:  struct<type:tinyint,size:int,indices:array<int>,values:array<double>>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease track the trace below to double check.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.arrow.ArrowUtils$.toArrowType(ArrowUtils.scala:56)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.arrow.ArrowUtils$.toArrowField(ArrowUtils.scala:92)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.arrow.ArrowUtils$.$anonfun$toArrowSchema$1(ArrowUtils.scala:116)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike.$anonfun$map$1(TraversableLike.scala:237)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:941)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator.foreach$(Iterator.scala:941)\r\n\tat scala.collection.AbstractIterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:1429)\r\n\tat scala.collection.IterableLike.foreach(IterableLike.scala:74)\r\n\tat scala.collection.IterableLike.foreach$(IterableLike.scala:73)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType.foreach(StructType.scala:99)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike.map(TraversableLike.scala:237)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike.map$(TraversableLike.scala:230)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType.map(StructType.scala:99)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.arrow.ArrowUtils$.toArrowSchema(ArrowUtils.scala:115)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.arrow.ArrowBatchStreamWriter.<init>(ArrowConverters.scala:50)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.$anonfun$collectAsArrowToR$2(Dataset.scala:3215)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.$anonfun$collectAsArrowToR$2$adapted(Dataset.scala:3212)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**For float and binary types:**\r\n\r\nThey cause corrupt values in some cases. It needs to be investigated separately.\r\n\r\n**For array type:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in Table__to_dataframe(x, use_threads = use_threads) :\r\n  cannot handle Array of type list\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems to be Arrow's R library limitation. It needs to be investigated separately as well.\r\n\r\n2.. While I am touching the type specification codes across Arrow optimization, I move the Arrow optimization related tests into a separate filed called `test_arrow.R`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests were added and also manually tested.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-05T05:39:33Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:43Z","closed_at":"2019-03-11T01:25:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"928834027ad4ec8a7143d71ca98036673e112f10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a58c86dfeff23a0c0f333b205ad182a4bf5af332","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-26920","ref":"SPARK-26920","sha":"a58c86dfeff23a0c0f333b205ad182a4bf5af332","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Have two methods `buildReader` and `buildReaderWithPartitionValues` in `FilePartitionReaderFactory`, which have exactly the same meaning as they are in `FileFormat`\r\n2. Rename `buildColumnarReader` as `buildColumnarReaderWithPartitionValues` to make the naming consistent.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-04T16:05:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T10:09:26Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T10:09:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2562a8430a41ca131958d7a6f6d7ab0a138ea5ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23961/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23961/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23961/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f2f5668ec7f47155f80cb44110c20c7dc44d5df9","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:refactorReaders","ref":"refactorReaders","sha":"f2f5668ec7f47155f80cb44110c20c7dc44d5df9","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we run sql in spark via SparkSQLDriver (thrift server, spark-sql), SQL string is siet via ``setJobDescription``. the SparkUI SQL tab must show SQL instead of stacktrace in case ``setJobDescription`` is set which is more useful to end user. Instead it currently shows in description column the callsite shortform which is less

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf a task is failing due to a corrupt cached `KafkaProducer` and the task is retried in the same executor then the task is getting the same

After several retries the query stops.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm closing the old cached `KafkaProducer` and reopen a new one.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith large partition, pyspark may exceeds executor memory limit and trigger out of memory for python 2.7.\r\nThis is because map() is used. Unlike in python3.x, python 2.7 map() will generate a list and need to read all data into memory. \r\n\r\nThe proposed fix will use imap in python 2.7 and it has been verified.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test.\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf submits a stage with abundant tasks, rack resolving takes a long time when initializing TaskSetManager caused by a mass of loops to execute rack resolving script.\r\nBased on current implementation, it takes 30~40 seconds to resolve the racks in our 5000 nodes' cluster. After applied the patch, it decreased to less than 15 seconds. Furthermore, in another cluster which is a disaggregated storage and compute architecture, setting locality wait time to zero, there is no delay at all when launches tasks.\r\n```\r\nfor (i <- (0 until numTasks).reverse) {\r\n    addPendingTask(i, true)\r\n}\r\n...\r\nprivate[spark] def addPendingTask(index: Int) {\r\n    for (loc <- tasks(index).preferredLocations) {\r\n      ...\r\n      for (rack <- sched.getRackForHost(loc.host)) {  //<--- invoke one host per time\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n[YARN-9332](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-9332) has added an interface to handle multiple hosts in one invocation to save time. But before upgrading to the newest Hadoop, we could construct the same tool in Spark to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT and manually testing:\r\n| Cluster    |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMaropu and I have some conversation about insert overwrite noexist local path.\r\nIn local[*] mode, maropu give a test case as follows:\r\n```\r\n$ls /tmp/noexistdir\r\nls: /tmp/noexistdir: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"create table t(c0 int, c1 int)\"\"\")\r\nscala> spark.table(\"t\").explain\r\n==

middle result from local temporary path to created path.This test based on newest master.\r\nI follow the test case provided by maropu,but find another behavior.\r\nI run these SQL maropu provided on local[*] deploy mode based on 2.3.0.\r\nInconsistent behavior appears as follows:\r\n```\r\nls /tmp/noexistdir\r\nls: cannot access /tmp/noexistdir: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"create table t(c0 int, c1 int)\"\"\")\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\nscala> spark.table(\"t\").explain\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nHiveTableScan [c0#5, c1#6],

I pull the master branch and compile it and deploy it on my hadoop cluster.I get the inconsistent behavior again.\r\nThe spark version to test is 3.0.0.\r\n```\r\nls /tmp/noexistdir\r\nls: cannot

a UT to master and need jenkins run it so that prove it or tell me some information.\r\nUT results are the same as those of maropu's test, but different from mine.\r\nThe `insert overwrite local directory` will use `LocalFileSystem`. I have check the source of Hadoop `LocalFileSystem `.`LocalFileSystem` don't implement the method `rename`. `LocalFileSystem` extends `ChecksumFileSystem` and the latter implement the method `rename`.\r\nThe method `rename` of `ChecksumFileSystem` as follows:\r\n```\r\n  public boolean rename(Path src, Path dst) throws IOException {\r\n    if (fs.isDirectory(src)) {\r\n      return fs.rename(src, dst);\r\n    } else {\r\n      if (fs.isDirectory(dst)) {\r\n        dst = new Path(dst, src.getName());\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      boolean value = fs.rename(src, dst);\r\n      if (!value)\r\n        return false;\r\n\r\n      Path srcCheckFile = getChecksumFile(src);\r\n      Path dstCheckFile = getChecksumFile(dst);\r\n      if (fs.exists(srcCheckFile)) { //try to rename checksum\r\n        value = fs.rename(srcCheckFile, dstCheckFile);\r\n      } else if (fs.exists(dstCheckFile)) {\r\n        // no src checksum, so remove dst checksum\r\n        value = fs.delete(dstCheckFile, true); \r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return value;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIf target path is a directory, `ChecksumFileSystem` will move source file into target path.\r\nIf target path is not a directory, `ChecksumFileSystem` will rename source file to target file.\r\nThere exists a variable named `fs` that is a `RawLocalFileSystem`. `RawLocalFileSystem` will call the method `rename` of UNIXFileSystem or `WinNTFileSystem`.\r\nI have tried to find out why UT and my spark behave differently when executing insert overwrite local directory in local mode. But I'm failed! According to the source code of InsertIntoHiveDirCommand, there no chance to create the target path that doesn't exist yet.Could you help me, find out the reason.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace `System.currentTimeMillis()` by `Instant.now()` in the `CurrentTimestamp` expression. `Instant.now()` uses the best available clock in the system to take current time. See [JDK-8068730](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8068730) for more details.
