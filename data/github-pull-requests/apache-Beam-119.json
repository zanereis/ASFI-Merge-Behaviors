new connector for Cloud Firestore is being added to Beam and currently out for review (see #14261). Some of the features and adjustments are useful for Cloud Datastore as well, so they're being backported to this connector.  \r\n\r\n### Ramp-up throttling\r\n\r\nThis follows the same implementation as the Firetore connector, though implemented as a subtransform in the Write/Delete PTransform for simplicity and so the change is more easily visible.  \r\nIn essence, the ramp-up throttler is a generic rate limiter that emits elements only when there is sufficient \"budget\". This budget starts at 500 entities per second (split across workers) and increases by 50% every 5 minutes, as documented under [Datastore Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/best-practices#ramping_up_traffic). Abiding by this rule is not always necessary, the throttling step can be turned off in that case.\r\n\r\n### Minor tweaks\r\n\r\nThere have been minor tweaks and adjustments to some of the constants along the way.\r\n\r\n* Raised target latency for automatic batch sizing from 5 to 6 seconds.\r\n* Decreased initial batch size from 200 to 50.\r\n* Decresed minimum batch size from 10 to 5.\r\n* The default user agent from pipeline options is set, so the Beam version used is visible by the Datastore team for debugging. \r\n* Add two metrics to help users debug, `datastoreEntitiesMutated` and `datastoreLatencyMsPerMutation`.\r\n\r\nR: @chamikaramj \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pull request fixes a subtle bug that occurs reliably for me on Google Cloud Dataflow. When using `save_main_session`, Python SDK workers will attempt to download a `pickled_main_session` file from Google Cloud Storage, and will use that file to reload the `__main__` session. Pipelines that depend on this functionality expect names defined in `__main__` to be present at runtime, and will fail with `NameError`s if the main session is not available.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, roughly 0.5% of the time (in my experience), the Python SDK worker fails to download `pickled_main_session` from GCS to the local worker machine, and an empty file is created in its place. This causes Dill to log an `EOFError`<sup>1</sup>, but then continues to load and run the user code, which then fails due to missing names. For small pipelines (under 20 workers) this almost never occurs; but larger pipelines with hundreds of workers often have at least one machine fail to load the `__main__` session due to this bug, and the subsequent `NameError` exceptions cause the entire batch job to fail.\r\n\r\nThis patch does three things:\r\n - checks to see if the pickled main session file is empty\r\n - if so, raises a new type of exception (`CorruptMainSessionException`)\r\n - catches that exception, logs it, and then re-raises, causing the worker to fail to boot.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I don't know if this is the right solution or if it will generalize to all Beam use cases, but I've found this patch to work effectively in my team's pipelines. If a corrupt main session is detected, the worker fails to boot, Cloud Dataflow restarts the container, and the pickled main session loads correctly on the second try. An alternative implementation might be to ensure that the pickled main session's file size matches the size provided by the remote filesystem.\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb\r\nR: @lukecwik \r\n\r\n---\r\n<sup>1</sup> Example traceback from an empty main session file:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/worker/sdk_worker_main.py\", line 131, in main\r\n    _load_main_session(semi_persistent_directory)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/worker/sdk_worker_main.py\", line 236, in _load_main_session\r\n    pickler.load_session(session_file)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/apache_beam/internal/pickler.py\", line 318, in load_session\r\n    return dill.load_session(file_path)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/dill/_dill.py\", line 368, in load_session\r\n    module = unpickler.load()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/dill/_dill.py\", line 472, in load\r\n    obj = StockUnpickler.load(self)\r\nEOFError: Ran out of input\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

and `__setstate__` are one of several Python protocols\r\nthat can be used to implement pickling for a custom type. If the return\r\nvalue from calling `obj.__getstate__()` on a user-provided object is\r\ndeterministic, then we can use it to deterministically code the object.\r\n\r\nThis provides a low-boilerplate and robust way to make a custom object\r\nsuitable for use as a key in Beam transforms.\r\n\r\nNote that we don't need to worry about these protocols in the\r\nnon-deterministic case, because the fall-back coder already handles\r\nthese via pickle.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

addresses the last few ambiguous `WontImplementError`s that we raise (outlined [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12029?focusedCommentId=17322545&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17322545)). For some of these this just means clarifying the exception messages. Others (`append(verify_integrity=True)`, `shift`) actually get slightly modified logic.\r\n\r\nThe PR also includes an update to `DeferredFrameTest._run_error_test` to validate exceptions that are raised at execution time, so we can use it to test `append(verify_integrity=True)`.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

implementation for `DataFrame.insert`. This is essentially a trivial elementwise operation that just adds a new column to a DataFrame. The only complication is that insert is an inplace operation.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a new method to `DeferredFrameTest`, called `_run_inplace_test`, intended for validating inplace operations. It creates a wrapper that makes a copy of the input (so we don't unintentionally re-use one that has been mutated), and handles returning the mutated object, so it can be compared.

blank line in the example `private static class MyDataSourceProviderFn` in the \"Reading from JDBC datasource\" causes javadoc to terminate prematurely. While this is probably a bug in javadoc, it causes the documentation to be missing everything after that spot -- including the rather important \"how to write to a JDBC datasource\" section.. If you take out this line the javadoc builds correctly. This bug was not in 2.23.0 but was in 2.24.0\r\n\r\nI removed the blank line; this allows the doc to build correctly.\r\n\r\nR: @turb \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a revised approach of #13053 which unblocks #14633. Previously, I had tried to override the portable expansion to make it back into the non-portable expansion. I encountered a lot of what I _think_ are bugs in transform override framework, Dataflow v1beta3 translator, and the batch side input overrides themselves.\r\n\r\nI do think I will need to add the overrides back for streaming.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR optimizes how we encode the records by choosing the specific WindowedValueCoder to use depending on the type of windowing used in the PCollections, if the associated windowing function is in global windows it uses the optimized encoding via `ValueOnlyWindowedValueCoder` to only convert the value to bytes instead of the full WindowedValue (value, timestamp, windows, pane) as FullWindowedValueCoder does.\r\n\r\nThis takes advantage of the fact that (timestamp, windows and pane) do not really matter for the final computation in Batch mode and brings the benefits of smaller shuffled data (Beam basically is adding ~13 extra bytes per record) and smaller memory footprint beause the decoded `WindowedValue` representation relies on existing static objects: BoundedWindow.TIMESTAMP_MIN_VALUE and GlobalWindow.INSTANCE.\r\n\r\nR: @je-ik @ibzib
