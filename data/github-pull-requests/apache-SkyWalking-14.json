Refactor span analysis code structures. \r\n___\r\n\r\nIn our showcase and Java agent scenarios, there are several cross-thread tracing cases, we were not generating endpoint dependency if ref exists in local and exit span.

On default every period consumer thread loops all groups trying\r\n* to fetch the data from queue, if the queue only contains few elements, it is too expensive to consume every\r\n* time.\r\n*\r\n* if 'size of last fetched data' > 0\r\n*\r\n* priority = 'size of last fetched data' * 100 / {@link Channels#size()} * {@link Channels#getChannelSize()}\r\n*\r\n* else\r\n*\r\n* priority = priority / 2\r\n*\r\n* Meaning, priority is the load factor of {@link #channels}\r\n*\r\n* After consuming loop, priority = (priority of current loop + priority of last loop) / 2.\r\n*\r\n* If priority > 50, consuming happens in next loop, otherwise, priority += 10, and wait until priority > 50. In\r\n* worth case, for a low traffic group, consuming happens in 1/10.\r\n```","created_at":"2022-03-11T09:37:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T13:06:29Z","closed_at":"2022-03-11T13:06:26Z","merged_at":"2022-03-11T13:06:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"08d481e5fc4164f1e9c7e352c833b08bd62915e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":783582051,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODM1ODIwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/core%20feature","name":"core feature","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"Core and important feature.
