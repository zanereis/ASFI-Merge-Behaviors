What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36699\r\n\r\nWe proposed to optionally change behavior of stage-level scheduling by reusing compatible executors. Two executors binding to different resource profiles are **compatible** only when the executorResources (cores in particular if not defining custom resources) are the same, but taskResources can be different. When the executors are compatible, the tasks can be allocated to any of them even when in the different profiles. Users defining profiles should make sure the different taskResources are properly specified against the same executorResources. \r\nA SparkConf option `spark.dynamicAllocation.reuseExecutors` is defined to change the default behavior which is not reusing executors. When this option is turned on, dynamic allocation will count all compatible executors number to meet init/min/max executor number restrictions. \r\nThe first PR will focus on reusing executors with same cores without custom resources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent stage-level scheduling allocated separated set of executors for different executor profiles. This approach simplified implementation, however is a waste of executor resources when the existing executors have enough resources to run the following tasks.\r\n\r\nThe typical user scenario is for different stages, user wants to use different core number for the task with same executor resources. For instance in CPU machine learning scenario, to achieve the best performance, given the same executor resources, when in ETL stage, user will allocate 1 core per task and many tasks, and in the following CPU training stage, user will use more cores per task and less tasks. In the existing implementation, two separated profiles and executors are created. Reusing executors will get better CPU resource utilization and better performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-09T02:43:22Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T00:36:24Z","closed_at":"2022-09-30T00:36:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42efb4efe0186dee4a2d44fdd435114230365071","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add a few LZ4 wrapper classes for Parquet Lz4 compression output that uses Hadoop Lz4 codec.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we use Hadop 3.3.1's shaded client libraries. Lz4 is a provided dependency in Hadoop Common 3.3.1 for Lz4Codec. But it isn't excluded from relocation in these libraries. So to use lz4 as Parquet codec, we will hit the exception even we include lz4 as dependency.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info]   Cause: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/shaded/net/jpountz/lz4/LZ4Factory                                                                                            \r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.lz4.Lz4Compressor.<init>(Lz4Compressor.java:66)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.Lz4Codec.createCompressor(Lz4Codec.java:119)                                                                                                         \r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool.getCompressor(CodecPool.java:152)                                                                                                          \r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool.getCompressor(CodecPool.java:168)     \r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the issue is fixed at Hadoop new release, we can add a few wrapper classes for Lz4 codec.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix dropping all columns of a DataFrame\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen dropping all columns of a pandas-on-Spark DataFrame, a ValueError is raised.\r\nWhereas in pandas, an empty DataFrame reserving the index is returned.\r\nWe should follow pandas.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nFrom\r\n```py\r\n>>> psdf = ps.DataFrame({\"x\": [1, 2], \"y\": [3, 4], \"z\": [5, 6]})\r\n>>> psdf\r\n   x  y  z\r\n0  1  3  5\r\n1  2  4  6\r\n\r\n>>> psdf.drop(['x', 'y', 'z'])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)\r\n\r\n```\r\nTo\r\n```py\r\n>>> psdf = ps.DataFrame({\"x\": [1, 2], \"y\": [3, 4],

time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCustomers have been asking for this feature because they feel like implementing session timeouts with dynamic allocation is not satisfactory and they would like to close any idle spark-shells automatically.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt adds a new config value `spark.repl.inactivityTimeout` that enables a timer for user input. Once this expires, an error is logged and the shell is closed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe change was tested manually and two new unit tests have also been added.","created_at":"2021-09-08T08:37:46Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T15:00:30Z","closed_at":"2021-12-15T14:58:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"263bcc3d47248b5796bb40d57e86fb4e23192c3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is one of the patches for SPARK-33235: Push-based Shuffle Improvement Tasks.\r\nAt high level, in `MapOutputTrackerWorker`, if serialized `MergeStatuse` array size is larger than threshold(`spark.shuffle.push.mergeResult.minSizeForReducedCache`), cache the much more compact serialized bytes instead and only cache the deserialized `MergeStatus` objects that are needed (within `startPartitionId` until `endPartitionId`). Then deserialize the `MergeStatus` array from the cached serialized bytes again.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor large shuffles with 10s or 100s of thousands of shuffle partitions, caching the entire deserialized and decompressed MergeStatus array on the executor side, while perhaps only 0.1% of them are going to be used by the tasks running in this executor is a huge waste of memory.\r\nThis change helps save memory as well as helps with reducing GC pressure on executor side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. This PR introduces a client-side config for push-based shuffle(`spark.shuffle.push.mergeResult.minSizeForReducedCache`). If push-based shuffle is turned-off then the users will not see any change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test.\r\nVerified effectiveness with jobs that would fail due to GC issue otherwise.\r\n\r\nRan the benchmark using GitHub Actions and did not observe any performance penalties.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes cleanup the deprecated APIs in `missing/*.py`, and raise proper warning message for the deprecated APIs such as pandas does.\r\n\r\nAlso remove the checking for pandas < 1.0, since now we only focus on following the behavior of latest pandas.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe should follow the deprecation of APIs of latest pandas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNow the some APIs raise proper alternative message for deprecated functions such as pandas does.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan `dev/lint-python` and manually check the pandas API documents one by

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to add more Not operator simplifications in `BooleanSimplification` by applying the following rules\r\n  - Not(null) == null\r\n    - e.g. IsNull(Not(...)) can be IsNull(...)\r\n  - (Not(a) = b) == (a = Not(b))\r\n    - e.g. Not(...) = true can be (...) = false\r\n  - (a != b) == (a = Not(b))\r\n    - e.g. (...) != true can be (...) = false\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR simplifies SQL statements that includes Not operators.\r\nIn addition, the following query does not push down the filter in the current implementation\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE (not boolean_col) <=> null\r\n```\r\nalthough the following equivalent query pushes down the filter as expected.\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE boolean_col <=> null\r\n```\r\nThat is because the first query creates `IsNull(Not(boolean_col))` in the current implementation, which should be able to get simplified further to `IsNull(boolean_col)`\r\nThis PR helps optimizing such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"testOnly *BooleanSimplificationSuite  -- -z SPARK-36665\"\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-08T00:23:47Z","updated_at":"2021-11-09T04:18:51Z","closed_at":"2021-11-07T09:18:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8ab89973d73d91258ab76eaa5b08d8083f8dd4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f503822a8aed5173f0f2f18c16079c9c95371869","head":{"label":"kazuyukitanimura:SPARK-36665","ref":"SPARK-36665","sha":"f503822a8aed5173f0f2f18c16079c9c95371869","user":{"login":"kazuyukitanimura","id":129050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura","html_url":"https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":394523815,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQ1MjM4MTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"kazuyukitanimura/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kazuyukitanimura","id":129050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura","html_url":"https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-26346 upgrade Parquet related modules from 1.10.1 to 1.11.1 and `parquet-jackson 1.11.1` use `com.fasterxml.jackson` instead of `org.codehaus.jackson`. \r\n\r\nSo, there are warning logs related to \r\n\r\n```\r\n17:12:17.605 WARN org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem: Cannot load filesystem\r\njava.util.ServiceConfigurationError:

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the description about the possible values of `spark.sql.catalogImplementation` property.\r\nIt was added in SPARK-36153 (#33362) but the possible values are `hive` or `in-memory` rather than `true` or `false`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix wrong description.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo handle a corner/missed case in `NestedColumnAliasing` that can cause users to encounter a runtime exception. \r\n\r\nConsider the following schema:\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- a: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- c: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- e: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- d: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\nand the query:\r\n`SELECT MAX(a).c.e FROM (SELECT a, b FROM test_aggregates) GROUP BY b`\r\n\r\nExecuting the query before this PR will result in the error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot generate code for expression: max(input[0, struct<c:struct<e:string>,d:int>, true])\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.cannotGenerateCodeForExpressionError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:83)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Unevaluable.doGenCode(Expression.scala:312)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Unevaluable.doGenCode$(Expression.scala:311)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.AggregateExpression.doGenCode(interfaces.scala:99)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe optimised plan before this PR is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'Aggregate [b#1], [_extract_e#5 AS max(a).c.e#3]\r\n+- 'Project [max(a#0).c.e AS _extract_e#5, b#1]\r\n   +- Relation default.test_aggregates[a#0,b#1] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nA new unit test in `NestedColumnAliasingSuite`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support a case-insensitive variant of the `like` expression - `ilike`. In this way, Spark's users can match strings to single pattern in the case-insensitive manner. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table ilike_ex(subject varchar(20));\r\nspark-sql> insert into ilike_ex values\r\n         > ('John  Dddoe'),\r\n         > ('Joe   Doe'),\r\n         > ('John_down'),\r\n         > ('Joe down'),\r\n         > (null);\r\nspark-sql> select *\r\n         >     from ilike_ex\r\n         >     where subject ilike '%j%h%do%'\r\n         >     order by 1;\r\nJohn  Dddoe\r\nJohn_down\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe syntax of `ilike` is similar to `like`:\r\n```\r\nstr ILIKE pattern[ ESCAPE escape]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Implementation details\r\n`ilike` is implemented as a runtime replaceable expression to `Like(Lower(left), Lower(right), escapeChar)`. Such replacement is acceptable because `ilike`/`like` recognise only `_` and `%` as special characters but not special character classes.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The PR aims to support `ilike` in SQL only. Others APIs can be updated separately on demand.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To improve user experience with Spark SQL. No need to use `lower(col_name)` in where clauses.\r\n2. To make migration from other popular DMBSs to Spark SQL easier. DBMSs below support `ilike` in SQL:\r\n    - [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/ilike.html#ilike)\r\n    - [Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_patternmatching_condition_like.html)\r\n    - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-matching.html)\r\n    - [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions/#ilike)\r\n    - [Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/LanguageElements/Predicates/LIKE-predicate.htm)\r\n    - [Impala](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/impala_operators.html#ilike)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, it doesn't. The PR **extends** existing APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a small followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33876 which proposes to use `datetime.tzinfo` instead of `datetime.tzname` to see if timezome information is provided or not.\r\n\r\nThis way is consistent with other places such as:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9c5bcac61ee56fbb271e890cc33f9a983612c5b0/python/pyspark/sql/types.py#L182\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9c5bcac61ee56fbb271e890cc33f9a983612c5b0/python/pyspark/sql/types.py#L1662\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn some cases, `datetime.tzname` can raise an exception (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.tzname): \r\n\r\n> ... raises an exception if the latter doesn’t return None or a string object,\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this in Jenkins with setting `spark.sql.timestampType` to `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` by default:\r\n\r\n```\r\n======================================================================\r\nERROR: test_time_with_timezone (pyspark.sql.tests.test_serde.SerdeTests)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/jenkins/workspace/SparkPullRequestBuilder/python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_serde.py\", line 92, in test_time_with_timezone\r\n...\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/pypy3/lib-python/3/datetime.py\", line 979, in tzname\r\n    raise NotImplementedError(\"tzinfo subclass must override tzname()\")\r\nNotImplementedError: tzinfo subclass must override tzname()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to end users because it has not be released.\r\nThis is rather a safeguard to prevent potential breakage. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to support number-only column names in ORC data sources.\r\nIn the current master, with ORC datasource, we can write a DataFrame which contains such columns into ORC files.\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT 'a' as `1`\").write.orc(\"/path/to/dest\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut reading the ORC files will fail.\r\n```\r\nspark.read.orc(\"/path/to/dest\")\r\n...\r\n== SQL ==\r\nstruct<1:string>\r\n-------^^^\r\n\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException.withCommand(ParseDriver.scala:265)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parse(ParseDriver.scala:126)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parseDataType(ParseDriver.scala:40)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc.OrcUtils$.org$apache$spark$sql$execution$datasources$orc$OrcUtils$$toCatalystSchema(OrcUtils.scala:91)\r\n```\r\nThe cause of this is `OrcUtils.toCatalystSchema` fails to handle such column names.\r\nIn `OrcUtils.toCatalystSchema`, `CatalystSqlParser` is used to create a instance of `StructType` which represents a schema but `CatalystSqlParser.parseDataType` fails to parse if a column name (and nested field) consists of only numbers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better usability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReduce the shuffle data can significantly improve the query performance and increase Spark cluster stability.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements dynamic bloom filter join pruning to reduce the shuffle data. The main changes:\r\n- Add `BuildBloomFilter` and `InBloomFilter` UDF.\r\n- Enhance `RepartitionByExpression` to support shuffle with `ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS` origin. Dynamic bloom filter join pruning use it to reuse exchange.\r\n- Add a new rule `DynamicBloomFilterPruning`.\r\n- Dynamic bloom filter join pruning supports AQE.\r\n- Support dynamic bloom filter nested with dynamic partition pruning when AQE enabled.\r\n- Add an AQE optimization rule(`OptimizeBloomFilterJoin`) to update the `expectedNumItems` base on stats collected by AQE which is more accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test:\r\n\r\nSQL | Before this PR | After this PR\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nq12 | 11 | 8\r\nq20 | 6 | 6\r\nq37 | 29 | 13\r\nq50 | 78 | 29\r\nq80 | 14 | 14\r\nq82 |

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we use Hadop 3.3.1's shaded client libraries. Lz4 is a provided dependency in Hadoop Common 3.3.1 for `Lz4Codec`. But it isn't excluded from relocation in these libraries. So to use lz4 as Parquet codec, we will hit the exception even we include lz4 as dependency.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info]   Cause: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/shaded/net/jpountz/lz4/LZ4Factory                                                                                            \r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.lz4.Lz4Compressor.<init>(Lz4Compressor.java:66)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.Lz4Codec.createCompressor(Lz4Codec.java:119)                                                                                                         \r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool.getCompressor(CodecPool.java:152)                                                                                                          \r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool.getCompressor(CodecPool.java:168)                                                                                                          \r\n ```\r\n\r\nI already submitted a PR (HADOOP-17891) to Hadoop to fix it.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch mainly proposes to add some e2e test cases in Spark for codec used by main datasources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe found there is no e2e test cases available for main datasources like Parquet, Orc. It makes developers harder to identify possible bugs early. We should add such tests in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-04T21:55:46Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T23:53:52Z","closed_at":"2021-09-07T23:53:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f36b1cc9f99bfc55664e66a31393c0ac0fd19cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/16e7db926486ca83166b214a0a53feafcae03f3b","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-36670","ref":"SPARK-36670","sha":"16e7db926486ca83166b214a0a53feafcae03f3b","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReturn `UnknownPartitioning` rather than throw an exception in `AQEShuffleReadExec`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe [RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids) replaces `AQEShuffleReadExec` with a custom operator that runs on the GPU. Due to changes in [SPARK-36315](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/dd80457ffb1c129a1ca3c53bcf3ea5feed7ebc57), Spark now throws an exception if the shuffle exchange does not have recognized partitioning, and this happens before the postStageOptimizer rules so there is no opportunity to replace this operator now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI am still in the process of testing this change. I will update the PR in the next few days with status.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-04T00:09:46Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T01:18:22Z","closed_at":"2021-09-07T20:50:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52ab99d4c707e0e8643f92d04ec9b33d14ec3171","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5eb19bf25bbc1b16ec05b74bbd7fa78d833982e","head":{"label":"andygrove:SPARK-36666","ref":"SPARK-36666","sha":"a5eb19bf25bbc1b16ec05b74bbd7fa78d833982e","user":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205463461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU0NjM0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"andygrove/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow in QueryExecutionListener we have exposed API to get the query execution information:\r\ndef onSuccess(funcName: String, qe: QueryExecution, durationNs: Long): Unit\r\ndef onFailure(funcName: String, qe: QueryExecution, exception: Exception): Unit\r\n\r\nBut we can not get a clear information that which query is this. In Spark SQL, I think that executionId is the identifier of a query execution. It makes sense to expose executionId to the QueryExecutionListener, so that people can easily find the exact query in UI or history server to track more information of the query execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEasier to find the matching query in UI. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nDeveloper Api change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `type: ignore[import]` annotations from numpy imports.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, minimum version of numpy  required  for the mypy tests is explicitly stated in the GitHub workflow files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince version 1.20 numpy is PEP 561 compatible so these ignores are no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change targets primarily our development process and should be relatively transparent to the end users:\r\n\r\n- If `pyspark` is installed as a package in the current environment both current master and this pr yield the same results  ([test_pr_package.sh.out.txt](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/7332501/test_pr_package.sh.out.txt) and [test_master_package.sh.out.txt](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/7332499/test_master_package.sh.out.txt) respectively)\r\n\r\n\r\n- If `pyspark` is added manually to `MYPYPATH` both this pr and current master yield large number of errors ([test_pr_mypypath.sh.out.txt](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/7332500/test_pr_mypypath.sh.out.txt) and [test_master_mypypath.sh.out.txt](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/7332498/test_master_mypypath.sh.out.txt)  respectively)\r\n\r\n  These errors are primarily, but not exclusively, related to `pyspark.pandas` hints (notable exception is `cloudpickle` ‒ to avoid this we could bring back stub file, that was removed during initial type hints migration). \r\n\r\n  In this case, users can silence the errors,, by providing appropriate `mypy.ini` file.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis behavior was tested using simple test files\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\r\n\r\nsc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()\r\nreveal_type(sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.linalg import DenseVector\r\n\r\nreveal_type(DenseVector([1, 2, 3]).toArray() + 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently `DynamicJoinSelection` has two features: 1.demote broadcast hash join, and 2.promote shuffled hash join. Both are achieved by adding join hint in query plan, and only works for equi join. However [the rule is matching with `Join` operator now](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/DynamicJoinSelection.scala#L71), so it would add hint for non-equi join by mistake (See added test query in `JoinHintSuite.scala` for an example).\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix `DynamicJoinSelection` to only apply to equi-join, and improve `checkHintNonEquiJoin` to check we should not add `PREFER_SHUFFLE_HASH` for non-equi join.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove the logic of codebase to be better.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to improve `DataSourceStrategy` to be able to push down boolean column filters. Currently boolean column filters do not get pushed down and may cause unnecessary IO.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe following query does not push down the filter in the current implementation\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE boolean_field\r\n```\r\nalthough the following query pushes down the filter as expected.\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE boolean_field = true\r\n```\r\nThis is because the Physical Planner (`DataSourceStrategy`) currently only pushes down limited expression patterns like`EqualTo`.\r\nIt is fair for Spark SQL users to expect `boolean_field` performs the same as `boolean_field = true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"core/testOnly *DataSourceStrategySuite   -- -z

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs part of SPARK-32920 implemented a simple approach to finalization for push-based shuffle. Shuffle merge finalization is the final operation happens at the end of the stage when all the tasks are completed asking all the external shuffle services to complete the shuffle merge for the stage. Once this request is completed no more shuffle pushes will be accepted. With this approach, `DAGScheduler` waits for a fixed time of 10s (`spark.shuffle.push.finalize.timeout`) to allow some time for the inflight shuffle pushes to complete, but this adds additional overhead to stages with very little shuffles.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, instead of waiting for fixed amount of time before shuffle merge finalization now this is controlled adaptively if min threshold number of map tasks shuffle push (`spark.shuffle.push.minPushRatio`) completed then shuffle merge finalization will be scheduled. Also additionally if the total shuffle generated is lesser than min threshold shuffle size (`spark.shuffle.push.minShuffleSizeToWait`) then immediately shuffle merge finalization is scheduled.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a performance improvement to the existing functionality\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes additional user facing configs `spark.shuffle.push.minPushRatio` and `spark.shuffle.push.minShuffleSizeToWait`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests in `DAGSchedulerSuite`, `ShuffleBlockPusherSuite`\r\n\r\nLead-authored-by: Min Shen

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds additional information to ERROR log while SparkConf is modified when spark.sql.legacy.setCommandRejectsSparkCoreConfs is set\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRight now, by default sql.legacy.setCommandRejectsSparkCoreConfs is set as true in Spark 3.* versions int order to avoid changing Spark Confs. But from the error message we get confused if we can not modify/change Spark conf in Spark 3.* or not.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Trivial change in the error messages is included\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew Test added - SPARK-36643: Show migration guide when attempting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to generalize `OptimizeSkewedJoin` to support all patterns that can be handled by current _split-duplicate_ strategy:\r\n\r\n1, find the _splittable_ shuffle query stages by the semantics of internal nodes;\r\n\r\n2, for each _splittable_ shuffle query stage, check whether skew partitions exists, if true, split them into specs;\r\n\r\n3, handle _Combinatorial Explosion_: for each skew partition, check whether the combination number is too large, if so, re-split the stages to keep a reasonable number of combinations. For example, for partition 0, stage A/B/C are split into 100/100/100 specs, respectively. Then there are 1M combinations, which is too large, and will cause performance regression.\r\n\r\n4, attach new specs to shuffle query stages;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nto Generalize OptimizeSkewedJoin \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\none additional config added\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting testsuites, added testsuites, some cases on our productive

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a config `spark.sql.parquet.accessByColumnOrdinal` \r\n\r\nWhen true, we access the parquet files by column original instead of catalyst schema mapping at the executor side. \r\n\r\nThis is useful when the parquet file meta is inconsistent with those in Metastore, e.g. creating a table with existing parquet files with column names renamed, the column names are changed by external systems.\r\n\r\n- What if the number of columns/inner fields does not match?\r\n  - if the number of requests columns (M)is greater than the one(N) in the parquet file, the [M, N-1] of the outputs will be filled with nulls, which is also the same as the current name-based mapping\r\n  - if the number of requests columns (M)is less than or equal to the one(N) in the parquet file, the [0, M-1] of fields will be token in order.\r\n- What if the types are not compatible?\r\n  - In this case, it throws unsupportedSchemaColumnConvertError \r\n\r\nBy default, it is off\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- What's the concrete use case that requires this feature?\r\n\r\nParquet's schema evolution is implementation-dependent and may causes inconsistency from file to file or file to metastore. Sometimes, 1) the table Spark's processing might be produced by other systems, e.g. renamed by hive https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6938, 2)some operations that do not introduce a force schema checking, e.g. `set location, `add partition`. With this feature, the users as data consumers can still read those data produced by different providers.\r\n\r\nSee also, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-2835\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter data accessibility \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnewly added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd the option to use physicalStats in AQE\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently when AQE's queryStage is not materialized, it uses the stats of the logical plan to estimate whether the plan can be converted to BHJ, and in some scenarios the estimated value is several orders of magnitude larger than the actual broadcast data, which can lead to large tables being broadcast\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new config spark.sql.adaptive.broadcastJoin.usePhysicalStats.enabled added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate both `DataFrame.approxQuantile` and `DataFrameStatFunctions.approxQuantile` to support overloaded definitions when multiple columns are supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current type hints don't support the multi-column signature, a form that was added in Spark 2.2 (see [the approxQuantile docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.approxQuantile.html).) This change was also introduced to pyspark-stubs (https://github.com/zero323/pyspark-stubs/pull/552). @zero323 asked me to open a PR for the upstream change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis change only affects type hints - it brings the `approxQuantile` type hints up to date with the actual code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan

Upstream SPARK-XXXXX ticket and PR link (if not applicable, explain)\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36627\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn JavaSerializer.JavaDeserializationStream we override resolveClass of ObjectInputStream to use the threads' contextClassLoader. However, we do not override resolveProxyClass, which is used when deserializing Java proxy objects, which makes spark use the wrong classloader when deserializing objects, which causes the job to fail with the following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 1.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.3 in stage 1.0 (TID 4, <host>, executor 1): java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: <class&gt;\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:581)\r\n\tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds:\r\n- the support of `TimestampNTZType` in pandas API on Spark.\r\n- the support of Py4J handling of `spark.sql.timestampType` configuration\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo complete `TimestampNTZ` support.\r\n\r\nIn more details:\r\n\r\n- ([#33876](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33876)) For `TimestampNTZType` in Spark SQL at PySpark, we can successfully ser/de `TimestampNTZType` instances to naive `datetime` (see also https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#aware-and-naive-objects). This naive `datetime` interpretation is up to the program to decide how to interpret, e.g.) whether a local time vs UTC time as an example. Although some Python built-in APIs assume they are local time in general (see also https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp):\r\n\r\n    > Because naive datetime objects are treated by many datetime methods as local times ...\r\n\r\n  semantically it is legitimate to assume:\r\n    - that naive `datetime` is mapped to `TimestampNTZType` (unknown timezone).\r\n    - if you want to handle them as if a local timezone, this interpretation is matched to `TimestamType` (local time)\r\n\r\n- ([#33875](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33875)) For `TimestampNTZType` in Arrow, they provide the same semantic (see also https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/format/Schema.fbs#L240-L278):\r\n    - `Timestamp(..., timezone=sparkLocalTimezone)` ->  `TimestamType`\r\n    - `Timestamp(..., timezone=null)` ->  `TimestampNTZType`\r\n\r\n- (this PR) For `TimestampNTZType` in pandas API on Spark, it follows Python side in general - pandas implements APIs based on the assumption of time (e.g., naive `datetime` is a local time or a UTC time).\r\n\r\n    One example is that pandas allows to convert these naive `datetime` as if they are in UTC by default:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    >>> pd.Series(datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1)).astype(\"int\")\r\n    0    0\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    whereas in Spark:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    >>> spark.createDataFrame([[datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)]]).selectExpr(\"CAST(_1 as BIGINT)\").show()\r\n    +------+\r\n    |    _1|\r\n    +------+\r\n    |-32400|\r\n    +------+\r\n\r\n    >>> spark.createDataFrame([[datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)]]).selectExpr(\"CAST(_1 as BIGINT)\").show()\r\n    +---+\r\n    | _1|\r\n    +---+\r\n    |  0|\r\n    +---+\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    In contrast, some APIs like `pandas.fromtimestamp` assume they are local times:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    >>> pd.Timestamp.fromtimestamp(pd.Series(datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)).astype(\"int\").iloc[0])\r\n    Timestamp('1970-01-01 09:00:00')\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    For native Python, users can decide how to interpret native `datetime` so it's fine. The problem is that pandas API on Spark case would require to have two implementations of the same pandas behavior for `TimestampType` and `TimestampNTZType` respectively, which might be non-trivial overhead and work. \r\n\r\n    As far as I know, pandas API on Spark has not yet implemented such ambiguous APIs so they are left as future work.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, now pandas API on Spark can handle `TimestampNTZType`. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport datetime\r\nspark.createDataFrame([(datetime.datetime.now(),)], schema=\"dt timestamp_ntz\").to_pandas_on_spark()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n                          dt\r\n0 2021-08-31 19:58:55.024410\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds the support of Py4J handling with `spark.sql.timestampType` configuration:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> lit(datetime.datetime.now())\r\nColumn<'TIMESTAMP '2021-09-03 19:34:03.949998''>\r\n```\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.timestampType\", \"TIMESTAMP_NTZ\")\r\n>>> lit(datetime.datetime.now())\r\nColumn<'TIMESTAMP_NTZ '2021-09-03 19:34:24.864632''>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added.","created_at":"2021-08-31T11:01:07Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:41Z","closed_at":"2021-09-09T00:57:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe626c6b797a3b191c806ab66cb93240ef807577","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33877/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33877/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33877/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f83511b4729f5d4906205f400cba57f5ab0dcd3b","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36625","ref":"SPARK-36625","sha":"f83511b4729f5d4906205f400cba57f5ab0dcd3b","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to implement `TimestampNTZType` support in PySpark's `SparkSession.createDataFrame`, `DataFrame.toPandas`, Python UDFs, and pandas UDFs with and without Arrow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo complete `TimestampNTZType` support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n- Users now can use `TimestampNTZType` type in `SparkSession.createDataFrame`, `DataFrame.toPandas`, Python UDFs, and pandas UDFs with and without Arrow.\r\n\r\n- If `spark.sql.timestampType` is configured to `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, PySpark will infer the `datetime` without timezone as `TimestampNTZType`. If it has a timezone, it will be inferred as `TimestampType` in `SparkSession.createDataFrame`.\r\n\r\n    - If `TimestampType` and `TimestampNTZType` conflict during merging inferred schema, `TimestampType` has a higher precedence.\r\n\r\n- If the type is `TimestampNTZType`, treat this internally as an unknown timezone, and compute w/ UTC (same as JVM side), and avoid localization externally.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unittests were added.","created_at":"2021-08-31T10:53:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:43Z","closed_at":"2021-09-02T05:00:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a58f04dedc5c4510afbe1c5844317c69162a4c35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33876/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33876/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33876/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2f4b9fadd99f5747215694c84726048f96bfa55d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36626","ref":"SPARK-36626","sha":"2f4b9fadd99f5747215694c84726048f96bfa55d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen a executor finished a task of some stage, the driver will receive a `StatusUpdate` event to handle it. At the same time the driver found the executor heartbeat timed out, so the dirver also need handle ExecutorLost event simultaneously. There was a race condition issues here, which will make `TaskSetManager.successful` and `TaskSetManager.tasksSuccessful` wrong result.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `TaskResultGetter.enqueueSuccessfulTask` use asynchronous thread to handle successful task, that mean the synchronized lock of `TaskSchedulerImpl` was released prematurely during midway https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskResultGetter.scala#L61. So `TaskSchedulerImpl` may handle executorLost first, then the asynchronous thread will go on to handle successful task. It cause `TaskSetManager.successful` and `TaskSetManager.tasksSuccessful` wrong result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n It will cause `TaskSetManager.successful` and `TaskSetManager.tasksSuccessful` wrong result. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix bugs around prefix-scan for both HDFS backed state store and RocksDB state store.\r\n\r\n> HDFS backed state store\r\n\r\nWe did \"shallow-copy\" on copying prefix map, which leads the values of prefix map (mutable Set) to be \"same instances\" across multiple versions. This PR fixes it via creating a new mutable Set and copying elements.\r\n\r\n> RocksDB state store\r\n\r\nPrefix-scan iterators are only closed on RocksDB.rollback(), which is only called in RocksDBStateStore.abort().\r\n\r\nWhile `RocksDBStateStore.abort()` method will be called for streaming session window (since it has two physical plans for read and write), other stateful operators which only have read-write physical plan will call either commit or abort, and don't close the iterators on committing. These unclosed iterators can be \"reused\" and produce incorrect outputs.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that resetting prefix-scan iterators is done on loading RocksDB, which was only done in rollback.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPlease refer the above section on explanation of bugs and treatments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT which failed without this PR and passes with this PR.","created_at":"2021-08-31T03:40:37Z","updated_at":"2021-08-31T23:01:56Z","closed_at":"2021-08-31T16:51:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f413c1dcb5618d9301c9655fbecf0a8e1ffb5475","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSince user always use ctrl+c to stop a starting SC when register with yarn in client mode when resources are tight.\r\n\r\nIn this time, SC have not register the Shutdown hook, this cause we won't invoke `sc.stop()` when exit the application.\r\nWe should register the ShutdownHook earlier when starting a SparkContext.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMake sure we will invoke `sc.stop()` when kill a starting SparkContext application.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `Table.capabilities` method return a `java.util.Set` of `TableCapability` enumeration type, which is implemented using `java.util.HashSet` now. Such Set can be replaced `with java.util.EnumSet` because `EnumSet` implementations can be much more efficient compared to other sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUse more

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRemove unused listener in HiveThriftServer2AppStatusStore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n`HiveThriftServer2AppStatusStore` provides a view of a KVStore with methods that make it easy to query SQL-specific state. \r\n\r\n`HiveThriftServer2Listener` has no function in this class, and it should not appear in this class. We can remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-30T08:04:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-31T03:43:21Z","closed_at":"2021-08-31T03:40:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fa5dafec7f0ad0af4e5ed581322848e7150192b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to add `BooleanType` support to the `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison` optimizer that is currently supports `NumericType` only.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to treat `BooleanType` as 1 bit integer so that we can utilize all optimizations already defined in `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison`.\r\n\r\nThis work is an extension of SPARK-24994 and SPARK-32858\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent implementation of Spark without this PR cannot properly optimize the filter for the following case\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE boolean_field = 2\r\n```\r\nThe above query creates a filter of `cast(boolean_field, int) = 2`. The casting prevents from pushing down the filter. In contrast, this PR creates a `false` filter and returns early as there cannot be such a matching rows anyway (empty results.)  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPassed existing tests\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"catalyst/test\"\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/test\"\r\n```\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"catalyst/testOnly *UnwrapCastInBinaryComparisonSuite   -- -z SPARK-36607\"\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/testOnly *UnwrapCastInComparisonEndToEndSuite  -- -z

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse WeakReference not SoftReference in LevelDB\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n(See discussion at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28769#issuecomment-906722390 )\r\n\r\n\"The soft reference to iterator introduced in this pr unfortunately ended up causing iterators to not be closed when they go out of scope (which would have happened earlier in the finalize)\r\n\r\nThis is because java is more conservative in cleaning up SoftReference's.\r\nThe net result was we ended up having 50k files for SHS while typically they get compacted away to 200 odd files.\r\n\r\nChanging from SoftReference to WeakReference should make it much more aggresive in cleanup and prevent the issue - which we observed in a 3.1 SHS\"\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTo make it easy to use/modify the semantic annotation, we want to have a shorter API to update the metadata in a dataframe. Currently we have `df.withColumn(\"col1\", col(\"col1\").alias(\"col1\", metadata=metadata))` to update the metadata without changing the column name, and this is too verbose. We want to have a syntax suger API `df.withMetadata(\"col1\", metadata=metadata)` to achieve the same functionality.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA bit of background for the frequency of the update: We are working on inferring the semantic data types and use them in AutoML and store the semantic annotation in the metadata. So in many cases, we will suggest the user update the metadata to correct the wrong inference or add the annotation for weak inference.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nA syntax suger API `df.withMetadata(\"col1\", metadata=metadata)` to achieve the same functionality as`df.withColumn(\"col1\", col(\"col1\").alias(\"col1\", metadata=metadata))`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nA unit test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe Guava Cache use in Spark with weight eviction mechanism has risk of memory leak because `LocalCache` weight eviction does not work when `maxSegmentWeight is >= Int.MAX_VALUE` [Guava#1761](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1761)\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr is add the `maximumWeight` value limit for Guava cache instances that use the weight eviction strategy,  include:\r\n\r\n1.  `spark.shuffle.service.index.cache.size` should <= 8g bytes\r\n2. `spark.shuffle.push.server.mergedIndexCacheSize` should <= 8g bytes\r\n3. `spark.sql.hive.filesourcePartitionFileCacheSize` should <=  256g\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoiding the weight eviction bug of Guava Cache(Guava#1761)\r\n\r\nBefore this pr, the following test will fail,  some cache entries was not evicted as expected and memory leak will occur\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testShuffleIndexCacheEvictionBehavior() throws IOException, ExecutionException {\r\n    Map<String, String> config = new HashMap<>();\r\n    String indexCacheSize = \"8192m\";\r\n    config.put(\"spark.shuffle.service.index.cache.size\", indexCacheSize);\r\n    TransportConf transportConf = new TransportConf(\"shuffle\", new MapConfigProvider(config));\r\n    ExternalShuffleBlockResolver resolver = new ExternalShuffleBlockResolver(transportConf, null);\r\n    resolver.registerExecutor(\"app0\", \"exec0\", dataContext.createExecutorInfo(SORT_MANAGER));\r\n\r\n    // need change access scope of shuffleIndexCache\r\n    LoadingCache<File, ShuffleIndexInformation> shuffleIndexCache = resolver.shuffleIndexCache;\r\n\r\n    // 8g -> 8589934592 bytes\r\n    long maximumWeight = JavaUtils.byteStringAsBytes(indexCacheSize);\r\n    int unitSize = 1048575;\r\n    // CacheBuilder.DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL\r\n    int concurrencyLevel = 4;\r\n    int totalGetCount = 16384;\r\n    // maxCacheCount is 8192\r\n    long maxCacheCount = maximumWeight / concurrencyLevel / unitSize * concurrencyLevel;\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < totalGetCount; i++) {\r\n      File indexFile = new File(\"shuffle_\" + 0 + \"_\" + i + \"_0.index\");\r\n      ShuffleIndexInformation indexInfo = Mockito.mock(ShuffleIndexInformation.class);\r\n      Mockito.when(indexInfo.getSize()).thenReturn(unitSize);\r\n      shuffleIndexCache.get(indexFile, () -> indexInfo);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    long totalWeight =\r\n      shuffleIndexCache.asMap().values().stream().mapToLong(ShuffleIndexInformation::getSize).sum();\r\n    long size = shuffleIndexCache.size();\r\n    // Both of the following assertions fail\r\n    Assert.assertTrue(size <= maxCacheCount);\r\n    Assert.assertTrue(totalWeight < maximumWeight);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd through the debug view,  there are 2 `segments.totalWeight` overflowed.\r\n\r\n![LocalCache](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1475305/130931637-2faa5e45-451b-47c6-b11c-6ec49de4c0f6.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter this pr, the above issue are avoided through the maximum limit because `maximumWeight` can no longer be greater than 2g.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe following 3 configs add the maximum limit:\r\n\r\n1.  `spark.shuffle.service.index.cache.size` should <= 8g bytes\r\n2. `spark.shuffle.push.server.mergedIndexCacheSize` should <= 8g bytes\r\n3. `spark.sql.hive.filesourcePartitionFileCacheSize` should <=  256g\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA or Jenkins
