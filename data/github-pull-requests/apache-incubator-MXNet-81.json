Once our master builds look stable, we should change that email to the dev@ list or set up some build@ mailing list.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a small change to delete the correct workspace for the Windows CPU build which will help avoid looking for the  '_STORAGE_TYPE_ID_TO_STR' not found error.","created_at":"2017-07-28T00:01:27Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T21:13:27Z","closed_at":"2017-07-28T23:22:31Z","merged_at":"2017-07-28T23:22:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb2374215de684b918df9e42a997f243a98a3707","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/551fa25a64e55247b53241d1219e001abcc4ea23","head":{"label":"apache:lxn2-jenkinsfile","ref":"lxn2-jenkinsfile","sha":"551fa25a64e55247b53241d1219e001abcc4ea23","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR implements square_sum op for row-sparse matrices. It actually fuses operators `square` and `sum` together to avoid computing dense gradient of the operator `sum` in backward passes. The operator `_square_sum` is registered as an internal operator since it's a temporary solution. After the functionality of fusing operators is finished in the future, this operator may become deprecated.\r\n\r\nSupported use cases:\r\n\r\n- `_square_sum(rsp, axis=0, keepdims=False/True) -> dns output`\r\n- `_square_sum(rsp, axis=1, keepdims=False) -> dns output`\r\n- `_square_sum(rsp, axis=1, keepdims=True) -> rsp output`\r\n\r\n@piiswrong @eric-haibin-lin @madjam @cjolivier01 @anirudh2290

step in a series of PRs towards reducing compilation warnings.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, two cast warnings in newly introduced code were fixed. \r\nAnd secondly, added scripts which monitor time for compilation and generate a summary based on counts and different types of warnings. A jenkins nightly job has been started based on this script. Currently the job runs on my fork, but once this script is merged into the main repo, I will change the target of the job to run with this repo.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n(Merged)
