I ran the test a couple hundred times in IntelliJ and was able to reproduce the failures. \r\n\r\nI added a couple methods to the test to shut down locators and memberships because that was a difference I saw introduced with GEODE-7919. But really I think that masks the problem. If you comment out the innards of those two new routines and give this test a couple hundred runs it'll repro the assertion failure.\r\n\r\nI satisfied myself that the solution was to add `Awaitility` calls around the key assertions so that's what I did.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Those failures aren't really because of windows, its because our windows CI instances have fully qualified hostnames as opposed to the linux docker

failed\r\n\r\nThe \"Message distribution has terminated\" failure is caused by an\r\nunreported NullPointerException in a residual reader thread introduced\r\nin the fix for GEODE-7727.  That fix caused a thread to say alive in a\r\npeer-to-peer tcp/ip Connection in order to clean up the receiving side\r\nof a socket.  The Connection shutdown method close() method, however,\r\nreleases the Connection's input buffer and nulls out the field.  The\r\nreader thread then threw an NPE that was caught and caused the\r\n\"Message distribution has terminated\" message, which is picked up as a\r\nsuspect string by the testing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis problem is also seen in GEODE-7894, GEODE-7871, GEODE-7873 and\r\nGEODE-7806.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to record the fact that a residual reader thread exists and\r\navoid releasing the Connection's input buffer when the connection is\r\nclosed.  This lets the reader thread do the cleanup.\r\n\r\nWhile testing the fix I found that the NioSslEngine was throwing an\r\nIllegalStateException when the reader thread tried to use it in this\r\nsame situation.  This exception wasn't being caught and caused more\r\nsuspect strings to be logged.  I've changed this to a checked exception\r\nthat is already handled by the reader thread.\r\n\r\nClientServerHostNameVerificationDistributedTest also wasn't working on\r\nmy Mac due to its /etc/hosts configuration.  I changed the test to allow\r\nthe IP address selected by LocalHostUtil to be a valid client/server\r\naddress for the SSL certificates it generates.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

was taking a look to `ConnectionProxyJUnitTest` and I realized that `verifyAckSend`and `verifyExpiry`methods were not using their `timeToWait` parameter, so in fact they were using the default `GeodeAwaitability` timeout value (5 minutes).\r\n\r\nI changed that and then I realized different calls to both methods were using different timeouts. And the one used for `verifyExpiry` in `testPeriodicAckSendByClient` was causing the test to fail, so I decided to homogenize calls to the same method, using a common timeout (the two new Duration objects in the class).\r\n\r\nAnd finally I removed the usage of deprecated `WaitCriterion` class.","created_at":"2020-03-19T10:40:15Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T16:29:04Z","closed_at":"2020-04-06T16:29:04Z","merged_at":"2020-04-06T16:29:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"087e47a33f51523c07fa15221be16f069e13b1c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/4827/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/4827/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4827/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/24203d86f2cc99c686e042fd87d4359ad9389d56","head":{"label":"Nordix:feature/GEODE-7892","ref":"feature/GEODE-7892","sha":"24203d86f2cc99c686e042fd87d4359ad9389d56","user":{"login":"Nordix","id":36034376,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MDM0Mzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36034376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix","html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":180747280,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODA3NDcyODA=","name":"geode","full_name":"Nordix/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Nordix","id":36034376,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MDM0Mzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36034376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix","html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix/geode","description":"Apache

version:**\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Allow+same+host+and+port+for+all+gateway+receivers\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\nThere is a problem with Geode WAN replication when GW receivers are configured with the same hostname-for-senders and port on all servers. The reason for such a setup is deploying Geode cluster on a Kubernetes cluster where all GW receivers are reachable from the outside world on the same VIP and port.\r\n\r\nThe problem experienced is that shutting down one server is stopping replication to this cluster until the server is up again. This is because Geode incorrectly assumes there are no more alive servers when just one of them is down, because since they share hostname-for-senders and port, they are treated as one same server.\r\n\r\nWith these changes locator is able to distinguish the different receivers using the same hostname and port so replication is not impacted when one server is stopped.\r\n\r\n( Link to
