Description ##\r\nAdd bytes conversion to NDArray.\r\nThe newly added NDArray's 'asbytes' and 'from_buffer' are completely equivalent to numpy's 'tobytes' and 'frombuffer', respectively.\r\nThese features make better use of NDArray.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add 'asbytes' method to NDArray\r\n- [x] Add 'from_buffer' function to NDArray\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis provides an updated fix for issue https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/19379.  To understand this fix, a bit of history is needed:\r\n\r\n- At some point (possibly the arrival of ubuntu 20.04) the destruction order at program exit of the CUDA context and MXNet's singleton engine became non-deterministic.  When the engine destruction occurred after the CUDA context destruction, a segfault would occur due to the release of CUDA resources to a non-existent context.\r\n- @ptrendx supplied the fix of not destroying MXNet's Stream objects at exit in master PR https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/19378, which also was back-ported to v1.x.\r\n- Since that time, improvements to CUDA have made it no longer susceptible to the problem, starting possibly with CUDA 11.2.  CUDA 10.2 and 11.0 are confirmed to be susceptible.\r\n- A different issue https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/20959 was found to be due to the lack of CUDA resource cleanup at exit.  As a result, @ptrendx's PR was reverted (on the v1.9.x branch) here https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/20998.  Due to the improvements in CUDA, most users did not experience the return of the original segfault-at-exit problem.\r\n- But clearly, for users still on CUDA 10.2 and 11.0, the segfault behavior has returned (see recent posts to issue https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/19379).\r\n\r\nThis PR resupplies the segfault fix of not destroying MXNet's Stream objects only to the parent process (detected by `shutdown_phase_ == true`). If the main process is exiting, the CUDA runtime will take care of the release of resources.  This PR does not effect the release of resources in the child threads (`shutdown_phase == false`).  Thus, the destruction of Streams in the dataloader child processes are not affected and the data memory leak problem of https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/20959 will not resurface.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\nRegarding testing, I was first able to repro the segfault on a DGX1V (8 V100's) running the mxnetci/build.ubuntu_gpu_cu110 container with the command sequence:\r\n```\r\n$ HOROVOD_WITH_MXNET=1 pip install horovod[mxnet]\r\n$ python3 /work/mxnet/example/distributed_training-horovod/module_mnist.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is possible the segfault only occurs with horovod use.  I verified that the segfault occurred consistently with MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE set to all 3 possibilities: ThreadedEnginePerDevice, ThreadedEngine, and NaiveEngine.  After the fix of the PR was applied, the segfault did not appear for any of the engines.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-17T22:23:56Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T18:34:40Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T18:34:39Z","merged_at":"2023-02-28T18:34:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"76d73dbd778c9ab4a4584dbc857c8c0694faa162","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Patching CVE-2007-4559\n\nHi, we are security researchers from the Advanced Research Center at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com). We have began a campaign to patch a widespread bug named CVE-2007-4559. CVE-2007-4559 is a 15 year old bug in the Python tarfile package. By using extract() or extractall() on a tarfile object without sanitizing input, a maliciously crafted .tar file could perform a directory path traversal attack. We found at least one unsantized extractall() in your codebase and are providing a patch for you via pull request. The patch essentially checks to see if all tarfile members will be extracted safely and throws an exception otherwise. We encourage you to use this patch or your own solution to secure against CVE-2007-4559. Further technical information about the vulnerability can be found in this [blog](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html).\n\nIf you have further questions you may contact us through this projects lead researcher [Kasimir Schulz](mailto:kasimir.schulz@trellix.com).\n","created_at":"2022-12-14T16:35:58Z","updated_at":"2023-01-02T22:42:13Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31f498ea0b6d163632e2c9728638a71c0ae7eb30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAvoid a potential uninitialized read when using the C Predict API with symbols where the same input name occurs on more than one node.  Other parts of MXNet appear to treat this as an error, so this change makes the C API reject it with an error too.\r\n\r\nSince the C Predict API has been removed in MXNet v2 this PR is for merging into the 1.x branch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\nI could not find any existing tests for the C Predict API.  Please let me know if there's documentation that should be updated.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Reject symbols where a name occurs more than once in the C Predict API\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nIt's possible to cause an uninitialized read in the C Predict API.  If I construct a symbol and parameters file using the Python API as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet\r\nnet = mxnet.symbol.Variable('a') + mxnet.symbol.Variable('a')\r\nmxnet.nd.save('foo-params', {})\r\nnet.save('foo-symbol.json')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen substitute the contents of the generated files into this C++ code.  This causes an uninitialized read and fails the final assertion.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include <mxnet/c_predict_api.h>\r\n#include <string>\r\n#include <cassert>\r\n\r\nnamespace {\r\n\r\nconst char* SYMBOL_JSON = \"{\\\"nodes\\\":[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"null\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"a\\\",\\\"inputs\\\":[]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"null\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"a\\\",\\\"inputs\\\":[]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"elemwise_add\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"_plus0\\\",\\\"inputs\\\":[[0,0,0],[1,0,0]]}],\\\"arg_nodes\\\":[0,1],\\\"node_row_ptr\\\":[0,1,2,3],\\\"heads\\\":[[2,0,0]],\\\"attrs\\\":{\\\"mxnet_version\\\":[\\\"int\\\",10901]}}\"; \r\nconst char* PARAMS_BYTES = \"\\x12\\x01\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\\x0\";\r\nconst std::size_t PARAMS_SIZE = 32;\r\n\r\nconst char* INPUT_KEYS[] = { \"a\" };\r\nconst std::size_t INPUT_KEYS_SIZE = 1;\r\n\r\nconst uint32_t INPUT_SHAPE_INDPTR[] = { 0, 1 };\r\nconst uint32_t INPUT_SHAPE_DATA[] = { 1 };\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int, char**) {\r\n  PredictorHandle handle = nullptr;  \r\n\r\n  int res = MXPredCreate(\r\n    SYMBOL_JSON,\r\n    static_cast<const void*>(PARAMS_BYTES),\r\n    PARAMS_SIZE,\r\n    1,\r\n    0,\r\n    INPUT_KEYS_SIZE,\r\n    INPUT_KEYS,\r\n    INPUT_SHAPE_INDPTR,\r\n    INPUT_SHAPE_DATA,\r\n    &handle);\r\n  assert(res == 0);\r\n\r\n  static const float INPUT_DATA[] = { 5. };\r\n  res = MXPredSetInput(handle, \"a\", INPUT_DATA, 1);\r\n  assert(res == 0);\r\n\r\n  res = MXPredForward(handle);\r\n  assert(res == 0);\r\n\r\n  float output = 0.0;\r\n  res = MXPredGetOutput(handle, 0, &output, 1);\r\n  assert(res == 0);\r\n\r\n  assert(output == 10.0);\r\n  \r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf instead I generate the symbol as follows the test passes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet\r\nvar = mxnet.symbol.Variable('a')\r\nnet =  var + var\r\nmxnet.nd.save('foo-params', {})\r\nnet.save('foo-symbol.json')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the API should reject symbols where an input name appears more than once.  This seems to happen in other parts of the code.  For example the following code fails with an assertion error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet\r\nnet = mxnet.symbol.Variable('a') + mxnet.symbol.Variable('a')\r\nout = net.eval(ctx = mxnet.cpu(), a = mxnet.nd.array([[5.]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change makes the C Predict API reject such symbols.  With this change the above C++ code fails on the first assertion.","created_at":"2022-09-20T16:44:21Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T18:08:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9860d112f0e81bdb93b1e99678f0f0e2650f7a00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdded tutorial showing advantage of using INC with MXNet for quantization. It shows that INC can find operators mostly introduced loss of accuracy and eliminate it from quantization. This way partially quantized model achieves accuracy results almost the same as original floating point model, but with about 3 times performance improvement in comparison to optimized floating point model (or 30 times in comparison to not optimized floating point model). \r\nExample of results measured on ResNet50 v2 model:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58251767/186166723-9754dabf-1985-4b07-b816-bf2ddc12a0a6.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58251767/186166755-69f52542-1e59-42e9-b857-36a1b1b9288a.png)\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\n_npi_repeats gave correct outputs only when repetition happened on 0th axis. That's why swapaxes function was called before and after triggering _npi_repeats operator. swapaxes() was called from python side, thus when _npi_repeats was a node in a computational graph it resulted in wrong output (swapaxes wasn't called in that case).\r\n\r\n## Solution ##\r\nTrigger SwapAxis operator directrly by _npi_repeats operator.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Added check for repeats parameter - it throws ValueError when length of the list is not equal to the number of elements on the axis that is going to be repeated (numpy compatibility)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-02T09:48:12Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T07:31:54Z","closed_at":"2022-08-12T07:31:54Z","merged_at":"2022-08-12T07:31:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"1058369f8a3eea3147a727ac98fadfcb2ffe5d5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR makes improvements in the handling of CUDA resources by the ThreadedEnginePerDevice, and this appears to have corrected certain CI failures of the GPU jobs on Windows (6 of 6 passing), as mentioned first in issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20914 and more recently in PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/21107.\r\n\r\nBackground: As a general policy, a process should not have an active CUDA context, with unreleased CUDA resources like streams and events, prior to forking.  While it's even unclear whether this is guaranteed to work when the forked child process performs an immediate exec, in the absence of those assurances, the parent should definitely play it safe and release all CUDA resources prior to the fork. To help in that task, the following callback in initializer.cc is currently executed by the parent process prior to the fork:\r\n```\r\nvoid LibraryInitializer::atfork_prepare() {\r\n  using op::custom::CustomOperator;\r\n  CustomOperator::Get()->Stop();\r\n  Engine::Get()->Stop();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `Engine::Get()->Stop()` call then ultimately calls `ThreadedEnginePerDevice::StopNoWait()`.  This PR adds to `StopNoWait()` a release of CUDA resources introduced by the `async GPU dependency engine PR` https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20331 (namely `streams_` and `cuda_event_pool_per_worker_`).  In addition, a thread safety issue is corrected that might occur during the initial construction of GPUWorkers.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category

Description ##\r\nOn a recent PR of mine and in other PRs, I saw sporadic windows-gpu job failures, which I flagged awhile ago in issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20914 .  I feel now the problem is due to flakiness of `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` on Windows, as described here: https://www.scivision.dev/python-tempfile-permission-error-windows/.  This PR starts with a non-functional commit to show that master is suffering this problem (which indeed failed with the expected \"access violation\": https://jenkins.mxnet-ci.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/mxnet-validation%2Fwindows-gpu/detail/PR-21107/1/pipeline).  This PR then adds a like-named context manager routine `mxnet.util.TemporaryDirectory()` that wraps `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`, but ignores its cleanup issues on Windows.  Finally, the PR changes all uses of `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` in the codebase to use the newly added `mxnet.util.TemporaryDirectory()`.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I realize that this PR really targets a different error, namely \"access is denied\", as reported in this older issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17558\r\n\r\nThe \"access violation\" is a segfault in a backend thread, and so is likely a different issue.  This maybe a good PR to merge, if we are still seeing \"access is denied\".  But it won't correct the frequent windows GPU CI failures we are currently seeing.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL],

Description ##\r\nPR #20635, which began using the cuDNN v8 backend API for Convolution ops, includes the following line to avoid `test_gluon_gpu.py::test_group_conv2d_16c` failures that began occurring coincident with the PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@with_environment('MXNET_CUDNN_DISABLED_CONV_FWD_ENGINES', '5')  # eng:5 causes test failure on M60\r\n```\r\nThis PR will remove that line by providing a different implementation of the \"convolution plan cache\" introduced with PR #20635 that is compatible with convolution engine 5.  The steps of this PR will be:\r\n\r\n1. Reenable convolution engine 5, and demonstrate a return of `test_group_conv2d_16c` failures, then\r\n2. Add the upgrade to the convolution plan cache so that `test_group_conv2d_16c` passes even with engine 5 use\r\n\r\nFurther detail:\r\n\r\nThe cuDNN v8 backend allows one to bypass a lot of CPU processing that might precede kernel launch by first building up and finalizing a convolution execution plan.  The plan, which includes a choice of convolution engine and 'knob settings', is then executed efficiently by the call `cudnnBackendExecute(cudnn_handle, plan, ...)`.  PR #20635 introduced a cache of plans so that autotuning does not need to be repeated for identically-parameterized convolutions, which are then handled by the same plan even if they exist multiple times in a model or are handled by different GPU workers.\r\n\r\nThe issue that was discovered for convolution engine 5 is that it caches a cuDNN handle provided during the plan's construction, and does not consider the handle passed as an argument of cudnnBackendExecute().  The result is that the engine's kernels are launched into the stream of the cached handle, and this would be the incorrect stream if the GPU worker executing the plan is different from the one that created the plan.  Without the proper stream synchronization, incorrect results may follow.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of this PR is to effectively include a GPU worker's cudnn handle as part of the key used in the cache lookup.  One aspect of the fix though is that if there's a plan cache miss, a plan made by a different worker for the same convolution can be 'cloned' with the proper handle without repeating the autotuning.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I

unnecessary implicit conversion from float to float16 after division but before rounding (5.99745 was saved as 6 during conversion from float to float16, because of lack of precision).\r\n\r\n## Solution #\r\nFrom now, before doing calculations float16 arguments are explicitly casted to float and they are converted back to float16 only after division and rounding has been made.\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThis is the same as this https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20559. The PR adds the support for fetching the gradients of intermediate variables in a gluon HybridizedBlock. This applies uniformly to both when `block.hybridize()` is on and off. This generates the `attach_grad` implemented in implemented in [PR#20500](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20500). \r\n\r\nThe motivation of this feature comes from this [issue#11865](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11865).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] `block.py` where `mark_vars` and `get_mark_vars` are added along with `MXNDArrayMarkDCVariables`.\r\n- [x] `cached_op.invoke` in cpp backend and `CachedOp.__call__` have been editted to include the pass of marked nonleaf ndarrays.\r\n- [x] `set_nleafs` method is added into `CachedOp` class to store the marked nonleaf ndarrays.\r\n- [x] Inside `void RunGraph`, marked nonleaf ndarrays are linked to the marked computational node for autograd computation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This feature is built on top of  [PR#20500](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20500). The modification here is mainly in the invoke of CachedOp computation.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-08T16:54:59Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T19:37:09Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a60e84a01e93958caed64db766887b02c3406bf9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis is the same as this [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20559). The PR adds the support for fetching the gradients of intermediate variables in a gluon HybridizedBlock. This applies uniformly to both when `block.hybridize()` is on and off. This generates the `attach_grad` implemented in implemented in [PR#20500](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20500). \r\n\r\nThe motivation of this feature comes from this [issue#11865](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11865).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] `block.py` where `mark_vars` and `get_mark_vars` are added along with `MXNDArrayMarkDCVariables`.\r\n- [x] `cached_op.invoke` in cpp backend and `CachedOp.__call__` have been editted to include the pass of marked nonleaf ndarrays.\r\n- [x] `set_nleafs` method is added into `CachedOp` class to store the marked nonleaf ndarrays.\r\n- [x] Inside `void RunGraph`, marked nonleaf ndarrays are linked to the marked computational node for autograd computation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This feature is built on top of  [PR#20500](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20500). The modification here is mainly in the invoke of CachedOp computation.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-06T23:43:01Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T16:51:42Z","closed_at":"2022-07-08T16:51:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd3010d16fcb253ed34b2d17798f1e031d8d32c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

There's no `MXSymbolInferStorageType` C API. I think a complete fix would require some C API

output, happens to be all non-negative (and treated as u8) while fc output is s8. In this situation, data_2 will be rescaled to s8 as well to prevent truncation of fc output.\r\nThis change also prevents the situation when fc output is u8 and data_2 is

Description ##\r\nIt adds quantization for npi_add. From performance point of view the most important is to use the previously existing path with oneDNN sum primitive whenever it is possible (where calculation could be done in place). But also it should service all kind of allowed inputs - inputs which could be broadcasted according to NumPy rules – which is supported by oneDNN binary operator.\r\n+ tests for it,\r\n+ benchmark for FC + npi_add with broadcasted input\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes
