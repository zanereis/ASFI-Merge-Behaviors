Note that those tests\r\n  are run separately using Host environment and those tests\r\n  are stored in \"kubernetes_tests\" folder.\r\n\r\n* If some of the core/other files change, all tests are run.

This seems to be a common\r\nerror, when NGINX proxy is used to proxy Github Registry so\r\nit is likely that retrying will workaround the issue.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

running Airflow on Cloud Kubernetes  Services like Azure Kubernetes Service, KubernetesExecutor can hangs indefinitely on pod submission due to idle connection time-out. For example in Azure Firewall, idle timeout is set to [4 minutes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#what-is-the-tcp-idle-timeout-for-azure-firewall). Simmilar problem can be observe on AWS.\r\n\r\n[Kubernetes client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/tree/master/kubernetes) under the hood is using urllib3 PoolManager which introduce connections reuse. On idle timeout, RST package is send back to client which cause urllib3 to hang indefinitely. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduced fix based on TCP keepalive mechanism. Unfortunately Kubernetes client does not support providing socket options when instantiating `CoreV1Api` instance.\r\n\r\nIt was nightmare to find out why request were hanging.

seem to have a problem with running all tests at once - most\r\nlikely due to some resource problems in our CI, therefore it makes\r\nsense to split the tests into more batches. This is not yet full\r\nimplementation of selective tests but it is going in this direction\r\nby splitting to Core/Providers/API/CLI tests. The full selective\r\ntests approach will be implemented as part of #10507 issue.\r\n\r\nThis split is possible thanks to #10422 which moved building image\r\nto a separate workflow - this way each image is only built once\r\nand it is uploaded to a shared registry, where it is quickly\r\ndownloaded from rather than built by all the jobs separately - this\r\nway we can have many more jobs as there is very little per-job\r\noverhead before the tests start runnning.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is the final part of implementing #11171 based on feedback\r\nfrom enterprise customers we worked with. They want to have\r\na capability of building the image using binary wheel packages\r\nthat are locally available and the official Dockerfile. This means\r\nthat besides the official APT sources the Dockerfile build should\r\nnot needd GitHub, nor any other external files pulled from outside\r\nincluding PIP repository.\r\n\r\nThis change also includes documentation on how to prepare set of\r\nsuch binaries ready for inspection and review by security teams\r\nin Enterprise environment. Such sets of \"known-working-binary-whl\"\r\nfiles can then be separately committed, tracked and scrutinized\r\nin an artifact repository of such an Enterprise.\r\n\r\nFixes: #11171\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^

always want to use one database in Airflow and FAB. The existence of this configuration in the default_webserver_config.py file causes problems when the user configures their own webserver_config.py. and fails to add a valid database configuration. By default, SQLite will be used in Airflow 1.10. In Airflow 2.0, this option is likely not taken into account by Airflow, but external plugins can still access it, so it's a good idea to sync it.\r\n\r\n@potiuk we encountered this problem with one of our users recently.\r\nRelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/8940\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

upgrading dependencies in setup.py still run with previous versions of the package for the PR which fails.\r\n\r\nThis PR will change it to only upgrade the package if a requirement is not satisfied (i.e. if we change the upper or lower bound of dependency in setup.py).\r\n\r\nThis will avoid the situation like https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11020 and https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11313 where we can't test upgrading the package in the PR itself. And we were \"deadlocked\" even after merging the PR as the constraints won't allow installing the new version of the package, I had to generate new constraints myself and push to constraints-master branch (https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/e6e840f16c33225bb80cf7836ef6a355262e6594), this is not ideal and won't be possible for just contributors.\r\n\r\nUsing `only-if-needed` upgrade strategy - packages are only upgraded if they are named in the pip command or a requirement file (i.e, they are direct requirements), or an upgraded parent needs a later version of the dependency than is currently installed.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n**Using `only-if-needed`**:\r\n```\r\nroot@822984cd3cf4:/opt/airflow# pip install -e . --upgrade --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed\r\nObtaining file:///opt/airflow\r\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: alembic<2.0,>=1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (1.4.3)\r\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: jinja2<2.12.0,>=2.10.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (2.11.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: json-merge-patch==0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (0.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: tabulate<0.9,>=0.7.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (0.8.7)\r\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: graphviz>=0.12 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (0.14.1)\r\nCollecting tenacity~=6.2.0\r\n  Downloading tenacity-6.2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (24 kB)\r\n...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n**Using `eager`**:\r\n```\r\nroot@822984cd3cf4:/opt/airflow# pip install -e . --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager\r\nObtaining file:///opt/airflow\r\nRequirement already up-to-date: alembic<2.0,>=1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (1.4.3)\r\nRequirement already up-to-date: argcomplete~=1.10 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (1.12.1)\r\nRequirement already up-to-date: cryptography>=0.9.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (3.1.1)\r\nRequirement already up-to-date: dill<0.4,>=0.2.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (0.3.2)\r\nRequirement already up-to-date: funcsigs<2.0.0,>=1.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0) (1.0.2)\r\nCollecting graphviz>=0.12\r\n  Downloading graphviz-0.14.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (18 kB)\r\n....\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR is part of the \"unofficial\" epic to replace the current Flask Appbuilder permissions with updated, resource-based permissions. Rather than assigning access to individual view methods, access is doled out based on the data objects and models accessed within the method.\r\n\r\n*This PR shouldn't be merged until after #11189*\r\n\r\nThis epic has three steps, *this is step 2*.\r\n1. Update the dag-level permissions. Prefixes the DAG resource name with `DAG:`, and replaces `can_dag_edit` and `can_dag_read` with `can_read` and `can_edit`. https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11189\r\n2. Migrate the Airflow view to use resource-backed permissions. This includes creation of a custom `has_access` decorator, deprecation of the `has_dag_access`decorator, a migration script to update existing roles to use the new permissions, and adding the new `has_access` decorator to the Airflow view class's methods.\r\n3. Migration of the other view classes (beyond the class named Airflow) to use resource based permissions.\r\n\r\nRelated

a new Airflow ETL tutorial to use functional DAGs.

I will create the html documentation page to cover this as soon as I get confirmation from @casassg and @turbaszek that this is in the right general direction.

rare race condition was noticed in the Scheduler HA PR where the\n\"test_dags_with_system_exit\" test would occasionally fail with the\nfollowing symptoms:\n\n- The pipe was \"readable\" as returned by\n  `multiprocessing.connection.wait`\n- On reading it yielded an EOFError, meaning the other side had closed\n  the connection\n- But the process was still alive/running\n\nThis previously would result in the Manager process dying with an error.\n\nThis PR makes a few changes:\n\n- It ensures that the pipe is simplex, not duplex (we only ever send one\n  data) as this is simpler\n- We ensure that the \"other\" end of the pipe is correctly closed in both\n  parent and child processes. Without this the pipe would be kept open\n  (sometimes) until the child process had closed anyway.\n- When we get an EOFError on reading and the process is still alive, we\n  give it a few seconds to shut down cleanly, and then kill it.\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!
