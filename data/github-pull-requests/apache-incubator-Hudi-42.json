For partitioned table, current implementation will drop only partitions involved in the select sub-query, other partitions won't be dropped( which should be dropped as expected).  \r\n\r\nThis pr to

[hoodie.copyonwrite.record.size.estimate] parameter setting is not reasonable, it will lead to a lot of small files.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis pr avoids  producing a lot of small files under

More information can be found in [RFC46](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/rfc/rfc-46/rfc-46.md).\r\n\r\nHoodieAvroRecordMerger and HoodiePayload are used together to support all existing features. Now the spark part has been realized. The following is the caveats with HoodieSparkRecordMerger\r\n- Only **Parquet log** is now supported\r\n- For sql merge api, it will automatically backoff to HoodieAvroRecordMerger\r\n- Not support hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats\r\n- SparkMerger should use \"HoodieSparkValidateDuplicateKeyRecordMerger\" with \"hoodie.sql.insert.mode=strict\"\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRebase release-feature-rfc46 on master\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf someone has enabled schema on read by mistake and never really renamed or dropped a column. it should be feasible to disable schema on read. This patch fixes that. essentially both on read and write path, if \"hoodie.schema.on.read.enable\" config is not set, it will fallback to regular code path. It might fail or users might miss data if any they have performed any irrevocable changes like renames. But for rest, this should work. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers can now disable schema on read feature if need be. \r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nManually tested that we could able to read a table which had schema on read enabled. after disabling, upserts succeed.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen our input data comes from a complex rdd lineage, hudi writing will lead to repeated calculations.\r\nFor example, we will de duplicate according to the key of the input data, and we will obtain all partitions to be written to the data in the tag location. So I think we should cache the data to be written for downstream use.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nadd new config (hoodie.persist.before.insert) controls whether they should be first persist before insert.\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nadd new config (hoodie.persist.before.insert) controls whether they should be first

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDropping dupes w/ inserts: We were trigging index look up twice. once to drop the dupes and then to perform writes. In this patch, we are optimizing it to just 1 call. After index look up w/ write operation, if drop dupes is set, we will drop the records which is already present. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves perf when drop dupes are enabled.\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nflink bundle use 1.10.0 avro version, but hudi common modes were generated during build process controlled by `avro.version` property, which is not overwritten in flink profiles. This would resulted in generated models being incompatible with included avro lib in flink-bundle. \r\n\r\nThis change separate out spark and flink build process in GH actions CI so that spark and flink profiles do not interfere each other. For example, spark 3.3 profile uses avro 1.11  which should not be used for flink bundle.\r\n\r\n#### Related issues\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/7259 \r\n- https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/7047\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Follow up \r\n\r\nWe need to make sure release artifacts not to be impacted by the profile settings.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7419/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBuild process for flink bundles has to be separated out from other bundles. Dev and release processes should be updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- [ ] build instructions to be updated\r\n- [ ] release process to be updated\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen commit buffer has failed `ClusteringCommitEvent`, the `ClusteringCommitSink` invokes the `CompactionUtil#rollbackCompaction` to rollback clustering. `ClusteringCommitSink` should call `ClusteringUtil#rollbackClustering` to rollback clustering. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCorrect the way of rollback clustering to handle failure case in the `ClusteringCommitSink`.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

the default value of estimate record size at the averageBytesPerRecord() when estimation threshold is less than 0\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, hudi obtains the average record size based on records written during previous commits. Used for estimating how many records pack into one file, and the code is about UpsertPartitioner.averageBytesPerRecord().\r\n\r\nBut we found that the single data file could become 600~700M and most other files are less than 200M.\r\n\r\n-  Reason\r\n\r\n1. the result of totalBytesWritten/totalRecordsWritten is very small when the last commit, but the next commit record is very large, then the data files will become very large. \r\n\r\n- Solve plan\r\n\r\n1. Plan1: calculate avgSize of the past several commit not just only one, but the getCommitMetadata costs a lot of time, then this function might be slow, so we did not choose this.\r\n\r\n1. Plan2: Use the estimated record size considering our data size is fixed in some sense, more the hudi community did not encourage adding a more boolean variable to control whether to use the last commit avgSize, then we use the estimation threshold, when it is less than 0, we use the default estimate record size.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUpsertPartitioner.averageBytesPerRecord(), small\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow, this feature works only when estimation threshold is less than 0\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated_\r\n\r\n> We use the previous commits' metadata to calculate the estimated record size and use it \"\r\n          + \" to bin pack records into partitions.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/7234 related to `HoodieMergeHandle` shutdown sequence: \r\nin introduced at https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4264 we changed the ordering in which we shut down the handle relative to the executor:\r\n\r\nBefore it was \r\n1. Handle\r\n2. Executor\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n1. Executor\r\n2. Handle\r\n\r\nThe reason it was switched was to handle the case when during exception thrown executor might still be writing out records, and closing of the handle (before the executor) was leaving some of the produced Parquet files corrupted.\r\n\r\nThis PR, addresses this issue by making sure that in the successful path we close the Handle immediately as soon as writing has finished (before we shutdown the executor), which would make sure this will not result in any `PipeBroken` exceptions in GCS\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAfter the files are written, table services like clustering and compaction can fail. This causes the sync to the metaserver to not happen. This pr adds a config that when set to false, the deltastreamer will not fail and the sync to the metaserver will occur. A warning will be logged with the exception that occurred. To use this new behavior, set `hoodie.fail.writes.on.inline.table.service.exception` to false.\r\n\r\n# How I tested:\r\nFirst, in inlineClustering:BaseHoodieWriteClient.java, add the following code before the return \r\n```\r\nif (true) {\r\n      throw new HoodieException(\"CLUSTER FAILURE\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Test not setting the config:\r\n1. Run the test testInlineClustering:TestHoodieDeltaStreamer.java\r\n2. Verify the tests pass and search the logs for \"CLUSTER FAILURE\"\r\n\r\n## Test setting the config:\r\n1. in writeCommonPropsToFile:HoodieDeltaStreamerTestBase.java add the line `props.setProperty(\"hoodie.fail.writes.on.inline.table.service.exception\",\"true\");`\r\n2. Run the test testInlineClustering:TestHoodieDeltaStreamer.java\r\n4. Verify the test failed with the hoodie exception \"CLUSTER FAILURE\"\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFor users that retry delta sync on failure, they will continue adding one commit each retry. New partitions will not show up in the metaserver.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\nA new configuration was created and an appropriate description was added\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-18T16:08:39Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T03:48:06Z","closed_at":"2022-11-29T03:48:06Z","merged_at":"2022-11-29T03:48:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"1cdbf68d4ee641b9e7eb0129a26e0f969b37d8ca","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhile rebasing Hudi's FileIndex implementations to do lazy-listing in https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6680, it was  unfortunately overlooked that it was issuing point-wise lookup operations when listing actual partitions instead of doing batch operations (thanks to @psendyk for noticing and reporting this!).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis should considerably reduce file-listing latency, especially when using MT.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A \r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRelated to [HUDI-5235](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5235)\r\n\r\n1. Need to add a check  between CLUSTERING_PLAN_STRATEGY_TARGET_FILE_MAX_BYTES and CLUSTERING_PLAN_STRATEGY_SMALL_FILE_LIMIT，otherwise, merged files will always fail to meet the clustering requirements\r\n\r\n2. Clustering Plan has check the size by CLUSTERING_PLAN_STRATEGY_TARGET_FILE_MAX_BYTES  already ,there is no need to check by PARQUET_MAX_FILE_SIZE again , Also this is a clustering operator not a stream writer operator.   In addition，target_size is calculated by the file size on hdfs（compressed ）, while parquet_size calculates the size by streaming writes(uncompressed ). A clustering group often combines multiple files,  it maybe causing some unknown bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe realized we don't have good test coverage for some of the core user flows w/ spark data source writes. So, enhancing the tests to cover the scenarios.\r\n\r\nTests coverage added w/ spark-data source writes:\r\n```\r\nCOW and MOR * (w/ and w/o metadata)\r\n    Partitioned(BLOOM, SIMPLE, GLOBAL_BLOOM), non-partitioned(GLOBAL_BLOOM).\r\n        Immutable data. pure bulk_insert row writing. \r\n        Immutable w/ file sizing. pure inserts. \r\n        initial bulk ingest, followed by updates.\r\n```\r\nThis pr is modeled after https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7179\r\nThis uses a different sql schema that only has regular and struct fields because the the schema in the test above was too complicated to create in sql\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWill help catch any bugs around core user flows upfront.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5182\r\n\r\nCreating a bundle which contains all the cli related dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Special Note\r\n* When testing the cli bundle I noticed that I had add the following two jars to my local spark class path in order for cli to start up (even though the bundle includes them)\r\n```\r\n                                    <include>jakarta.el:jakarta.el-api</include>\r\n                                    <include>org.glassfish:jakarta.el</include>\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis has now been addressed by adding an `auxlib`, which has the jars there, and then adding onto cp. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested the cli commands listed here https://hudi.apache.org/docs/cli/#using-hudi-cli with the cli bundle for both COW and MOR on hdfs and s3. \r\n\r\nPlatform tested on: EMR \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nHigh\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nlow risk as we are providing a new option to run cli but not removing the current way of starting up cli.  \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocs would need to be updated to call out this support \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-16T22:21:22Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T18:32:30Z","closed_at":"2022-12-20T00:17:41Z","merged_at":"2022-12-20T00:17:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fd3ff3e0c7eca01d7058936f86cbc3bd5b99a3a","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3782563563,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM7hdVbr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/cli","name":"cli","color":"8E1E55","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/6c98c102cf86ca7158a89d284c73bc5652028297","head":{"label":"rahil-c:rahil-c/cli-bundle-new","ref":"rahil-c/cli-bundle-new","sha":"6c98c102cf86ca7158a89d284c73bc5652028297","user":{"login":"rahil-c","id":32500120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTAwMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32500120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c","html_url":"https://github.com/rahil-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":396843805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTY4NDM4MDU=","name":"hudi","full_name":"rahil-c/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahil-c","id":32500120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTAwMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32500120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c","html_url":"https://github.com/rahil-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahil-c/received_events","type":"User"
