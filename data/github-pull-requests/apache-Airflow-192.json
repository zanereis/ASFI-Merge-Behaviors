is a bug fix for the CLI command `connections_import`. I originally added this CLI functionality in #15177. The bug was reported by @mudravrik [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/15177#issuecomment-822056108).\r\n\r\n## Bug summary\r\nRunning `airflow connections import <filepath>` results in an AttributeError.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/airflow/cli/commands/connection_command.py\", line 244, in connections_import\r\n    _import_helper(args.file)\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/airflow/cli/commands/connection_command.py\", line 272, in _import_helper\r\n    key: value for key, value in conn_values.items() if key in allowed_fields\r\nAttributeError: 'Connection' object has no attribute 'items'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Root cause\r\nI called the existing function `load_connections_dict` to get the contents of the target file, thinking it returned a list of dictionaries. When I later looped through the list, I called the dictionary method `.items()` on each connection. However, each connection was actually stored into a `Connection` model instance rather than a dictionary, so the call I made to `.items()` resulted in an AttributeError.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nIn taking a closer look at this issue, I realized the code block that contained the bug can be removed altogether. Having a list of `Connection` models to begin with (rather than dictionaries) eliminated the need to even examine the keys and values of the dictionaries. I had only done that to safely load the data into `Connection` models in the first place.\r\n\r\n## Preventing future issues\r\nTo avoid future issues, I also changed how the tests work for providing sample data. Before, a dictionary of sample data was set as the return value of `load_connections_dict`, which actually returns an object of type `List[Connection]`. Now, that dictionary of sample data is set to be the return value of a lower level function, `_parse_secrets_file`, which does no heavy lifting outside of parsing a JSON, YAML or env file and returns a dictionary.\r\n\r\nBug originally introduced in #15177, which closed

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nIntroduce a DAG Calendar View to provide visibility over the full state of the dag by displaying the aggregated dag runs' states in a calendar.\r\nThis makes it possible to monitor the state of thousands of dag runs in a single view that is concise and easy to understand. It is particularly useful to monitor the state of large backfills:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6229788/115161178-0b4afd80-a094-11eb-9d9f-38709d76700b.png)\r\n\r\nEach day is displayed with a color according to the dag runs' states for that day:\r\n- If at least one dag run has failed for a day, the day will be displayed as \"failed\".\r\n- If all dag runs have succeeded, the day will be shown as \"succeeded\". \r\n- If there are still running dag runs (and no failed dag run) for that day, the day will be shown as \"running\".\r\n\r\nA tooltip, for each day, gives the exact number of dag runs in each state for the day.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6229788/115161622-acd34e80-a096-11eb-989c-d40c0aa82676.png)\r\n\r\nClicking on a day redirects to the tree view for that day to show the task instances for that day.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n- New `/calendar` endpoint in `views.py`. \r\nThis view returns, for each day, the number of dag run in each state. Thus, only the `dag_run` table is queried, and the query returns at most 3 * days records. Thus, this view puts little strain on the database, even for dags with a large number of task instances.\r\n- New `calendar.html` template, `calendar.js` and `calendar.css` static files.\r\nThe calendar view is implemented usng d3, thus no additional dependency has been introduced.\r\n\r\nThe proposal has been discussed on the dev mailing list:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r6f2ea3f83d268a665ac63219553718ed089a01e9530627cca0572ab1%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E","created_at":"2021-04-18T21:39:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T16:42:54Z","closed_at":"2021-05-07T16:42:45Z","merged_at":"2021-05-07T16:42:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"87e440ddd07935f643b93b6f2bbdb3b5e8500510","assignee":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

The connection object's `login` field is set to `\"IAM:original-login\"` because the `login` value returned has `IAM:` prefixed.\r\n\r\nAs a result, any subsequent calls to `get_conn()` will fail with the AWS `client.get_cluster_credentials(...)` call complaining that `:` cannot be part of the `DbUser` argument.\r\n\r\nIn general, the values within any connection objects used by this hook should not be subject to mutation by `get_conn()` calls, and the addition of `deepcopy` is meant to enforce this.","created_at":"2021-04-16T20:39:35Z","updated_at":"2021-05-02T17:29:37Z","closed_at":"2021-05-02T17:29:05Z","merged_at":"2021-05-02T17:29:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc845caf785d2fe3f943a1120c743c983130ec27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/15412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/15412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/15412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e0a205b25bd351f5a10d4fb3f8fd096969278631","head":{"label":"zhzhang:postgreshook-deepcopy-conn","ref":"postgreshook-deepcopy-conn","sha":"e0a205b25bd351f5a10d4fb3f8fd096969278631","user":{"login":"zhzhang","id":2108214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDgyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2108214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/zhzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cb1344b63d6650de537320460b7b0547efd2353c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

creates a skeleton for the AIP-39 implementation to build on, and refactor the logic handling `@once` schedules out of the DAG class.\r\n\r\n~~The current implementation contains a lot of duplicated code, and the PR probably shouldn’t be merged until I can pick most of `next_dagrun_after_date` apart (and ultimately eliminate it entirely and rewrite all the tests against `DAG.next_dagrun_info()` or the various TimeTable classes instead).~~\r\n\r\nUpdate: I’ve since did that, so this PR is clean now.\r\n\r\nI want to post this WIP since the trivial `@once` implementation already exposes things missing from the interface outlined in AIP-39, and I had to invent an argument (`between`) to cover it. I want to know how ya’ll think of it 🙂 \r\n\r\n(Note: The current `TimeTable.next_dagrun_info()` interface is missing the session argument from AIP-39 because I don’t need it yet. It will be added when it needs to be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

is the implementation of AIP-40, Deferrable \"Async\" Tasks (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=177050929).\r\n\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n\r\n- A new concept of a Trigger is introduced, as a small piece of asyncio code that can fire off events\r\n  - There is a BaseTrigger and some time-related triggers under a new `airflow.triggers` package\r\n  - There is a new Trigger database model and associated `trigger` table\r\n  - `Async` versions of the various date/time sensors have been added which defer rather than poke.\r\n- There is a new persistent process (Job) called `triggerer`\r\n  - It only runs on Python 3.7+\r\n  - It handles polling the database for which triggers need running, running them, and re-scheduling task instances whose triggers have fired events\r\n  - If a trigger throws an exception or exits without firing an event, it logs why and marks dependent task instances as failed\r\n  - It monitors the asyncio event loop with a watchdog task and alerts the user if anything is overrunning (i.e. not using `await`) and blocking the loop.\r\n  - It is designed to run in parallel with itself in a highly-available manner, and also has built-in consistent-hash based partitioning (sharding) support\r\n- Task Instances have a new `deferred` state which indicates they are waiting on a trigger to run\r\n  - The trigger they are waiting for is stored in a new `trigger_id` column, and a failure timeout is in a `trigger_timeout` column\r\n  - The scheduler takes care of timing out task instances into the `failed` state\r\n  - Deferral is triggered by raising the `TaskDeferred` exception, or calling `self.defer` on the TaskInstance which does the same thing.\r\n  - A `next_method` and `next_kwargs` column are added to specify what a task instance/operator's execution entry point should be if it's not the default of `execute()`. They are currently only used by deferral, but have been written to be independent in case they are useful elsewhere.\r\n- Two new dependencies are added\r\n  - `jump-consistent-hash` is a small MIT licensed library that implements a fast, consistent hash algorithm\r\n  - `pytest-asyncio` is an Apache 2 licensed library that enables async tests to be written easily\r\n\r\nChanges that are deliberately not in here and will be in a future PR for them specifically:\r\n - UI warning when the triggerer is not running and you have deferred task instances\r\n - Updating Breeze to include `triggerer` in what it runs\r\n - Updating the Docker Compose files to include `triggerer`\r\n - Updating the Helm Chart to include `triggerer`\r\n - Some way of detecting/preventing DB access within

#14260\r\nrelated: #9824\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhen clearing task across dags using `ExternalTaskMarker` the dag state of the external DagRun is not set to active. So cleared tasks in the external dag will not automatically start if the `DagRun` is a Failed or Succeeded state.\r\n#9824 tried to fix a similar issue for subdag. But it did not fix `ExternalTaskMarker`. This PR fixes both.\r\n\r\nTwo changes are made to fix the issue:\r\n1. Make `clear_task_instances` set DagRuns' state to `dag_run_state` for all the affected DagRuns. \r\n2. The filter for `DagRun` in `clear_task_instances` is fixed too. Previously, it made an assumption that execution_dates for all the dag_ids are the same, which is not always correct.\r\n\r\n`test_external_task_marker_clear_activate` is added to make sure the fix does the right thing.","created_at":"2021-04-15T13:09:22Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T15:44:17Z","closed_at":"2021-05-29T15:01:40Z","merged_at":"2021-05-29T15:01:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"2bca8a5425c234b04fdf32d6c50ae3a91cd08262","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":199168283,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw

this change we implement a new operator that handles patching of table schemas in bigquery.\r\n\r\nThis is needed as typing out an entire schema data structure (schema), in order to set e.g. a field description on a single field requires a lot of overhead. Also, many times the schema is not known or very complex as it may be the result of a Query or parsed automatically when importing files as tables.\r\n\r\nThis operator is useful for a workflow like:\r\nUpstream: Create a BigQuery table as the output of a Query or import operator. Writer of job/operator knows the names of the fields, perhaps the types, but not necessarily how other schema fields are defined.\r\n\r\nDownstream (this operator): Supply a partial schema definition

when a container inside a encounter Image pull error, airflow doesn't know about it and\r\n tasks remain queued. The kubernetes Job Watcher does not watch the status of containers\r\ninside pods. It only watches the pod and report the pod's status to airflow.\r\n\r\nFrom kubernetes doc, the pending phase of a pod is defined to include the\r\ntime a Pod spends waiting to be scheduled as well as\r\nthe time spent downloading container images over the network.\r\n\r\nNetwork failure can crash the container while the pod remains Pending until a certain\r\ntime before it's deleted.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by including watching of containers in kubernetes job watcher's job\r\n\r\nThis should close https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/13542 and https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/15218 hopefully.\r\nAnd I prefer it to timing out.\r\n\r\ncc: @jedcunningham \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

fixes an issue where the workers cannot find the dag that is meant to run.\r\n\r\nWith git-sync enabled, the airflow_dag location is being set to where the dags are being cloned to, ex `$AIRFLOWHOME/dags/repo/dags`, but the subpath is remapping it to `$AIRFLOWHOME/dags`, thus the workers are not able to find the actually dag. \r\n\r\nAlso related:

the ability to run @task.docker on a python function and turn it into a DockerOperator that can run that python function remotely.\r\n```\r\n@task.docker(\r\n    image=\"quay.io/bitnami/python:3.8.8\",\r\n    force_pull=True,\r\n    docker_url=\"unix://var/run/docker.sock\",\r\n    network_mode=\"bridge\",\r\n    api_version='auto',\r\n)\r\ndef f():\r\n    import random\r\n    return [random.random() for i in range(10000000)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne notable aspect of this architecture is that we had to build it to make as few assumptions about user setups as possible. We could not share a volume between the worker and the container as this would break if the user runs the airflow worker on a docker container. We could not assume that users would have any specialized system libraries on their images (this implementation only requires python 3 and bash).\r\n\r\nTo work with these requirements, we use base64 encoding to store a jinja generated python file and inputs (which are generated using the same functions used by the PythonVirtualEnvOperator). Once the container starts, it uses these environment variables to deserialize the strings, run the function, and store the result in a file located at /tmp/script.out.\r\n\r\nOnce the function completes, we create a sleep loop until the DockerOperator retrieves the result via docker's get_archive API. This result can then be deserialized using pickle and sent to Airflow's XCom library in the same fashion as a python or python_virtualenv result.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

PROD images were added, some of the flags had two meanings\r\n\r\nThese behaved differently in PROD image and CI image and were the\r\nsource of confusion especially when start-airflow command was used.\r\n\r\nFor PROD image, the image can be customized during image building,\r\nand packages could be installed from .whl or .sdist packages\r\navailable in `docker-context-files`. This\r\nis used at CI and dockerhub building time to produce image built\r\npackages that were prepared using local sources.\r\n\r\nThe CI image is always built from local sources but airflow can\r\nbe removed and re-installed at runtime from pypi.\r\nBoth airflow and provider packages can be installed\r\nfrom .whl or .sdist packages available in dist folder. This is\r\nused in CI to test current provider packages with older\r\nAirflow released (2.0.0) and to test provider packages locally.\r\n\r\nAfter the change we have two sets of flags/variables:\r\n\r\nPROD image (building image):\r\n\r\n* install-airflow-version, install-airflow-reference,\r\n  install-from-docker-context-files\r\n\r\nCI image (runtime):\r\n\r\n* use-airflow-version, use-packages-from-dist\r\n\r\nThat should avoid confusion and failures of commands such as\r\n`start-airflow` that is used to test provider packages and\r\nairflow itself.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

POC allows the DAG specific permissions to be created/updated during DAG parsing, instead of during webserver start or cli sync-perm.\r\n\r\nWith a large number of DAGs, walking through them all to do DAG specific permissions isn't exactly fast and they can only change during the scheduler parsing anyways. Overall more efficient as we don't need to check every DAG as well, we only need to check a given DAG when it changes.\r\n\r\nThis also fixed a bug where the default webserver DAG specific syncing

consolidates the cli sync-perm command and the syncing that happens by default during webserver startup. Prior to this change, `access_control` wasn't supported in the default sync and the cli sync-perm command was slow when you have many DAGs.\r\n\r\nWith ~5k simple DAGs, this makes sync-perms faster (~24s -> ~10s). It does make the webserver startup slower (due to loading DagBag from the db vs just querying `DagModel`, but it also syncs `access_control` where it wasn't before.","created_at":"2021-04-08T23:44:34Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T22:27:43Z","closed_at":"2021-04-09T20:38:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7411f5ccfb5f7aa4b673f5f59e97ec4f28d0980e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

#13158.\r\n\r\nAs the UI has evolved, it has needed to diverge from the constraints of the aged, secondary Bootstrap dependency (by way of FAB). The alternative Bootstrap themes provided by FAB are no longer working properly, resulting in a sub-par user experience for anyone who might opt to use one. Supporting these themes would require substantial ongoing maintenance overhead. \r\n\r\nThe alternative themes don't provide a better user experience than the (newly refreshed) UI theme. I could see differentiation between multiple Airflow deployments as the goal for utilizing this feature. In that case, we have the option to set a different nav bar color by setting a color value in the `navbar_color` config.\r\n\r\nWhile this PR doesn't stop a user (who knows the inner workings of FAB) from configuring an alternative theme, it does ensure that the airflow theme is always loaded. There is no documentation of this feature in the Airflow docs, but this PR also removes comments suggesting usage of it and pointing to the FAB docs.\r\n\r\nI've also updated the theme CSS file naming to remove \"default\" so it doesn't suggest that it is something changeable.","created_at":"2021-04-08T14:17:48Z","updated_at":"2024-10-02T17:32:47Z","closed_at":"2022-07-25T09:09:40Z","merged_at":"2022-07-25T09:09:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"f634361cb7c1aa13deb098252784624a59339cad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale PRs per the .github/workflows/stale.yml policy file"},{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":1872841889,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODcyODQxODg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/dont-merge","name":"dont-merge","color":"a9e8f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes that should be skipped from the changelog (CI, tests, etc..)"},{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full tests needed","color":"e0c514","default":false,"description":"We need to run full set of tests for this PR to merge"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Even being 1 millisecond off will not load logs. Therefore any manipulation of the datetimepicker will still break logs. Long term, we should go down to at least second precision, if not even moreso.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

is a collection of related updates to improve the overall user experience of the Graph view.\r\n\r\nI tested these updates across varying DAG shapes/sizes including Task Groups. This testing also covered the hovering/clicking of the task status legend and the search filter functionality.\r\n\r\n### General\r\n- Simplifies JavaScript by removing the redundant inline styling for highlighting tasks and paths between them. This is accomplished by pairing a `data-highlight` attribute with CSS keyed off of it.\r\n- I tried not to go overboard (but couldn't help myself in a few places) on the syntax cleanup as that will be handled in the migration to an external JavaScript file for #14115.\r\n- Changes the \"edge\" (lines between tasks) curve to be smooth instead of angled straight lines. Single, smooth lines are easier for eyes to follow the path of than multiple jointed lines. This was accomplished by utilizing the `d3-shape` library.\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n|  <img width=\"1164\" alt=\"Image 2021-04-07 at 1 52 54 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/113912148-d0e68400-97a8-11eb-9d84-b55c6966b847.png\"> | <img width=\"1166\" alt=\"Image 2021-04-07 at 1 54 31 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/113912141-cf1cc080-97a8-11eb-817d-2665426ba20b.png\">  |\r\n\r\n- Slightly increases the vertical node separation (`nodeSep`) to make the graphs feel a little less crowded. This also reduces the amount that the task nodes overlap with the edges.\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| <img width=\"488\" alt=\"Image 2021-04-07 at 2 11 46 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/113914160-38053800-97ab-11eb-99d2-4ec1aa190642.png\">  | <img width=\"386\" alt=\"Image 2021-04-07 at 2 11 15 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/113914177-3f2c4600-97ab-11eb-9da5-2516f369ab1a.png\">  |\r\n\r\n- Fixed an unreported bug when you hover or click on \"no_status\" in the status legend at the top, the correlating tasks would not highlight. \r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| ![Screen Recording 2021-04-07 at 02 34 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/113916947-97187c00-97ae-11eb-84a9-97648f10593c.gif)  | ![Screen Recording 2021-04-07 at 02 35 37 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/113916939-94b62200-97ae-11eb-8f2d-1bc3b74ce2cb.gif)  |\r\n\r\n- Updated the Graph UI screenshot in the docs to reflect the changes in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Task and Path highlighting\r\n- Removes the varying stroke (border) weights of tasks when highlighting/hovering. This interaction isn't necessary given the non-highlighted tasks fade out. It (subjectively) makes for a smoother transition for only the stroke color to change instead of the weight as well.\r\n- Improves the styling of the \"path highlighting\". Instead of styling the downstream, hovered, and upstream tasks with 3 different border colors, I've given them all the same \"highlighted\" color and have also given the edges that connect them a similar styling. This simplifies the pattern and visually highlights the actual path between the tasks.
