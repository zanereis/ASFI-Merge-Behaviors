Without understanding all the details, it seems that the async tests run in xdist mode of tests suffer from the bug of pytest-xdist - because the thread that runs some of the tests is not main and it likely interferes with signals handling and is likely an incarnation of\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/620 (which still needs to be solved in pytest-xdist)\r\n\r\nSince those two tests that keeps on failing intermittently and the other tests have been marked as db_test - likely for the same reason, we should simply mark all the module as db_test to avoid the interference.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

It raises a `google.auth.exceptions.RefreshError`. Using task retries is sometimes not a good option as, e.g. a submitted BigQuey query should not be submitted again. \r\n\r\nThe error occur in tasks running in deferred mode where acquiring impersonated credentials happens frequently every x seconds depending on the task's poll_interval.\r\n\r\nIn this case we should have some retry to acquire impersonated credentials.\r\n\r\n_Note:_ The deferable version of `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` is using the the synchronous client call with the event loop's run_in_executor() method. https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/35833\r\n\r\ncloses:

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/38939\r\n\r\nWe added logic to change the date filters for the grid data when the selected run_id was out of range. But that created its own issue that if you refreshed the page, we could change the runs returned and there was no way to reset the page.\r\n\r\nMixing `run_id` as a url parameter and as an API param led to a messy source of truth. Now all of these checks happen during the grid_data request. We check if the run_id is within the current response. If not, we check against the API if the run_id is valid. If it is not valid, we remove the run_id selection. Otherwise, we update the base_date with the run's execution_date and refetch the grid_data.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-11T17:58:32Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T21:22:36Z","closed_at":"2024-04-11T20:36:22Z","merged_at":"2024-04-11T20:36:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"f87772f52aeaad2c99eb4c0b1f985b9aa4810ea9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

pull requests adds functionality to restore databricks run-ids in the `on_kill` callback if it is not set to allow the task being cancelled in case of task termination.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nWe encountered an issue in our MWAA (2.7.2) environment after enabling the deferred flag our databricks operators. If a deferred databricks task timed out, it will try to cancel the tasks but is unable to do so because of missing `run_id`:\r\n```\r\n{{databricks.py:412}} ERROR - Error: Task: my-task-id with invalid run_id was requested to be cancelled.\r\n```\r\nSince the run-id is only [set as an instance variable](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4f169bd2f3e27b8530da4b82d0d3b25b796eff39/airflow/providers/databricks/operators/databricks.py#L560) during execution, it is no longer available when the task is restored after the trigger has finished or is interrupted.\r\n\r\nWith this PR we are utilizing the `do_xcom_push` functionality of the operator that makes the run-id available via xcom. If the run-id is available in xcom, we pull it and use it for cancelling the active task.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Related issue\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/37898\r\n\r\n### Explain\r\n\r\nWhen a LivyOperator was instantiated with deferrable=True and its batch job ran for more time than the set execution_timeout, airflow would detect this timeout and would cancel the trigger and then try to kill the task with the 'on_kill' method.\r\n\r\nBut that would fail raising an AttributeError because the batch_id attribute wouldn't be defined in the constructor method.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, the LivyTrigger will timeout itself before airflow does it, and it will send an event to the LivyOperator signaling that a timeout happened. This way, the operator can stop the running Livy batch job, and can fail the task instance gracefully.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Previously, `cancel_on_kill=True` worked well in non-deferrable mode but did not function as expected in `deferrable=True` mode. This bug has been resolved with this change. However, the bug has a larger scope and is a generic issue in the trigger. An issue has already been raised on Airflow regarding this matter and can be found at https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/36090.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

actually can't use the check `if task.dag_id != dag.dag_id` when it's a RPC call because we _don't actually serialize dag_ as part of the serialized operator.  And this sorta makes sense, because when serialization of Operator was added, it was always going to be in the context of a serialized _dag_.  So why add the serialized dag on the operator?  Indeed, if you fully represented the dag on the operator itself, you'd encounter infinite recursion!\r\nBut anyway, when we round trip an operator through BaseSerialization, we lose information about the dag.\r\n@uranusjr @potiuk @jedcunningham  I think it might be worth spending a brain cycle or two considering this.  Do you think perhaps that we should add `dag_id` as an attribute?  Or perhaps we could or should provide a mechanism to add a \"partial\" dag object that has at least the attrs we need on the `Operator.dag` attr?  Otherwise we can leave well enough alone and move on.  I don't think we _really_ need this check (@uranusjr you suggested adding it so you might weigh in)","created_at":"2024-04-10T19:38:51Z","updated_at":"2024-07-18T21:42:36Z","closed_at":"2024-04-11T05:04:37Z","merged_at":"2024-04-11T05:04:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"b90fa78e88cb33eb72bbd6552026db3685e2038f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vincbeck","id":97131062,"node_id":"U_kgDOBcoaNg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97131062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck","html_url":"https://github.com/vincbeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

If it disabled than plugin not activated and hooks pytest hooks injected.\r\n- Keep information about original warning and in which test suite it originally detected\r\n- Output path now relative to the tests directory if non -absolute path provided, but default stored into the `tests/warnings.txt` regardless of the current working directory. \r\n- Trim warning message filename paths to the project root or sites (system and users). Also add groups in which type of files warning raises. This one depends on `stacklevel` if it set incorrectly than it might come to the non-expected category\r\n   - **providers** - starts with `airflow/providers/`\r\n   - **airflow** - starts with `airflow/`\r\n   - **tests** - starts with `tests/`\r\n   - **other** - raised by third parties or in stdlib, or maybe \r\n- Avoid to use internal pytests classes which not a part of public interface\r\n- **New warning message summariser**, and also store merged file and per group into the Github artefacts\r\n\r\nThe only things the same with [pytest-capture-warnings](https://github.com/athinkingape/pytest-capture-warnings) is an idea, so I remove license headers, if some one have any objections feel free to ping me to return it. \r\n\r\n**Output before**\r\n\r\n```console\r\ntests/core/test_configuration.py:1411: [W0513(warning), ] The sql_alchemy_conn option in [core] has been moved to the sql_alchemy_conn option in [database] - the old setting has been used, but please update your config.\r\ntests/core/test_core.py:107: [W0513(warning), ] SELECT statement has a cartesian product between FROM element(s) \"task_fail\" and FROM element \"dag_run\".

PR provides enhancement for SSL support in `CloudSQLExecuteQueryOperator`.\r\n1. The previous implementation used to work with SSL certificates provided by users. If those files have excessive permissions, then `psql` raises an exception:\r\n```python\r\npsql: error: connection to server at \"10.40.112.2\", port 5432 failed: private key file \"client-key.pem\" has group or world access; file must have permissions u=rw (0600) or less if owned by the current user, or permissions u=rw,g=r (0640) or less if owned by root\r\n```\r\nIn order to fix this problem, the `CloudSQLDatabaseHook` copies those files into a `/tmp/certs/` with minimal required permissions, and uses those copies instead.\r\n\r\n2. Added integration with Google Cloud Secret Manager, so users now can store their certificates as secrets and specify a secret id in the operator.\r\n3. Refactored system tests and removed the deprecated example DAG.","created_at":"2024-04-10T13:32:04Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T08:56:35Z","closed_at":"2024-04-11T08:56:35Z","merged_at":"2024-04-11T08:56:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"1757704d8f7c7a335cdf8f90ccb12b4d8e6f9d9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

fix #38826?\r\n\r\nThis adds an additional filter on consuming DAG, and only create a DatasetDagRunQueue entry if the DAG is both active (i.e. still exists in a DAG file) and unpaused.\r\n\r\nThere are still questions unanswered:\r\n\r\n1. Do we consider catchup? The immediate problem here is catchup is not stored on DagModel, and checking it from DAG creates significant overhead.\r\n2. Do we just change the behavior outright?

production rollout of (my bad) contributions of Airflow 2.9.0 I realized that the links from the text in the legacy log view are generated but not clickable. The event-handler for the log grouping masks them.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the snipped of JavaScript and fixes the \"non clickable links\".\r\n\r\nAs making this fix in discussions with others we realized thatthe `ansi_up` library also creates links, in order to prevent problems with this in comparison with the link generation we do in the other script code, this PR disables link generation from `ansi_up`. Double link generation looks strange. Proposing to keep our \"existing\" regex as this was stable and the result I got from `ansi_up` were not directly working, might be a bug in this lib.\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n- Run Airflow from this PR\r\n- Run the `example_bash_operator` DAG\r\n- Open the logs from the task `run_after_loop`\r\n- Click on the log tab\r\n- Click in the \"more Logs\" link on the right side to get to legacy log view\r\n- Click on the link to apache, see it

observed that running the SFTPSensor in deferrable mode \r\nfails to close opened SSH connections to the server, resulting \r\nin a continuous increase of open connections over time. \r\nThis pull request addresses this issue by ensuring that \r\nconnections are opened using a context manager, allowing \r\nthem to be closed once the relevant data has been read \r\nfrom the SSH server during file sensing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

provider has an ambedded Airflow CLI command as of 3.6.1. When the #36794 was merged, we thought mistakenly that it will only be used in airflow 2.9.0+, so we used a feature introduced in Airflow 2.8.0 in the #34945 - but in fact the CLI command is configured by the Celery Executor which is also part of the Celery provider, so it was also used for airflow < 2.8.0 and failed due to missing import.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks if Airflow version is < 2.8.0 and if so, it falls back to built-in airflow CLI command.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR adds a new `retry_from_failure` parameter to the `DbtRunJobOperator` to retry a failed run of a dbt Cloud job from the point of failure. The implementation uses the new [rerun](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v2#/operations/Retry%20Failed%20Job) endpoint in the `dbt API` which handles the lookup of the last run for a given job itself and decides whether to start a new run of the job or not. \r\n\r\n~~New endpoint is only used when `retry_from_failure` is True and `try_number` of the task is greater than 1.~~\r\nNew endpoint is only used when previous dbt-cloud run was failed. \r\n\r\nIt also cannot be used in conjunction with `steps_override`, `schema_override` and `additional_run_config`.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses: #35772

Enhance Secret Name Selection Based on `gitSync` Image Version\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a conditional logic enhancement within the Helm chart templates to dynamically select the appropriate secret name based on the `gitSync` image version. Specifically, the addition targets scenarios where the `gitSync` image version is `v4.0.0` or newer. This is achieved through the Helm condition:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n{{- else if and .Values.dags.gitSync.credentialsSecret (semverCompare \">=v4.0.0\" .Values.images.gitSync.tag)}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe modification ensures that the deployment utilizes the correct credentials for `gitSync`, enhancing compatibility and security for different version requirements. This change is particularly important for environments with strict versioning and authentication mechanisms, ensuring smoother upgrades and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe update aligns with the Apache License, Version 2.0, and adheres to ASF's contribution guidelines. Comprehensive testing has been conducted to ensure no regressions in functionality. This contribution is a step towards more flexible and secure Helm chart configurations for the Apache Airflow community.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-08T14:51:21Z","updated_at":"2024-07-14T00:14:51Z","closed_at":"2024-07-14T00:14:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abacab6540eb2efc1ee3160626107924221cc93a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale
