Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10975](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10975) Adds an initial implementation of Kubernetes cluster leader election and state management, supporting deployments without the need for ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\n## State Management Implementation\r\n\r\nThe state management implementation uses Kubernetes [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) to persist cluster information for stateful components. The `KubernetesConfigMapStateProvider` uses the standard `data` property, but encodes property names using Base64 URL encoding without padding to meet [ConfigMap object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) property naming requirements.\r\n\r\nThe new State Provider can be configured in `state-management.xml` using the following element definition, which is included in a commented section of the configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<cluster-provider>\r\n    <id>kubernetes-provider</id>\r\n    <class>org.apache.nifi.kubernetes.state.provider.KubernetesConfigMapStateProvider</class>\r\n</cluster-provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Leader Election Implementation\r\n\r\nThe leader election implementation uses Kubernetes [Leases](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/) for distributed tracking of the current cluster leader. Kubernetes Lease names must adhere to [RFC 1123 subdomain naming requirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names), requiring a mapping from NiFi application names to Lease names.\r\n\r\nThe new Leader Election implementation can be configured using a new property in `nifi.properties` as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnifi.cluster.leader.election.implementation=KubernetesLeaderElectionManager\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Framework Changes\r\n\r\nThe leader election implementation required promoting the `LeaderElectionManager` interface to `nifi-framework-api` to support NAR bundle extension loading. The `LeaderElectionManager` had two methods without runtime references, which were removed. Refactoring also involved creating a new `nifi-framework-leader-election-shared` module for abstracting tracking operations.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi.properties` configuration includes a new property with a default value of `CuratorLeaderElectionManager`, which provides current cluster coordination using ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Client\r\n\r\nThe implementation includes a new `nifi-kubernetes-client` library which provides utility components for Kubernetes Client access and service namespace determination.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-kubernetes-client` library depends on the [Fabric8 Kubernetes Client](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client) which supports current versions of Kubernetes and provides separation of API and implementation classes.\r\n\r\nBoth the State Provider and Leader Election Manager implementations attempt to resolve the Kubernetes namespace based on the standard [Service Account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/) namespace secret. In absence of a readable namespace secret, the provider returns `default` as the namespace for storing Leases and ConfigMaps.\r\n\r\n## Additional Changes\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing several integration test classes specific to ZooKeeper. These integration tests are less useful with current system integration tests run on a scheduled basis.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

I set several printfs to see what exactly prints look like. According to the codes, the test function called testMultipleKeysOneNotFound, so the test should test to get the key value which not exist. However, what assertion test is testing an exist value. \r\n```\r\n @Test\r\n    public void testMultipleKeysOneNotFound() throws IOException {\r\n        service.put(\"key1\",\"value1\", new FetchDistributedMapCache.StringSerializer(), new FetchDistributedMapCache.StringSerializer());\r\n        runner.setProperty(FetchDistributedMapCache.PROP_CACHE_ENTRY_IDENTIFIER, \"key1, key2\");\r\n        // Not valid to set multiple keys without Put Cache Value In Attribute set\r\n        runner.assertNotValid();\r\n        runner.setProperty(FetchDistributedMapCache.PROP_PUT_CACHE_VALUE_IN_ATTRIBUTE, \"test\");\r\n        runner.assertValid();\r\n\r\n        final Map<String, String> props = new HashMap<>();\r\n        runner.enqueue(new byte[]{}, props);\r\n\r\n        runner.run();\r\n\r\n        runner.assertAllFlowFilesTransferred(FetchDistributedMapCache.REL_NOT_FOUND, 1);\r\n        runner.assertTransferCount(FetchDistributedMapCache.REL_NOT_FOUND, 1);\r\n\r\n        final MockFlowFile outputFlowFile = runner.getFlowFilesForRelationship(FetchDistributedMapCache.REL_NOT_FOUND).get(0);\r\n        outputFlowFile.assertAttributeEquals(\"test.key1\" \"value1\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI change the assertion to \r\n```\r\noutputFlowFile.assertAttributeEquals(\"test.key2\",null);\r\n```\r\nso the test not flaky anymore and pass the Nondex compile.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10958](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10958) Adjusts Script Engine property handling in `ScriptingComponentsHelper` to avoid exceptions on Java 17 during documentation generation. Additional work is necessary to support ECMAScript and the Nashorn engine on Java 17, but introduced an empty check during the Script Engine introspection process avoids complete documentation generation failures.\r\n\r\nCurrent unit tests for `createResources()` work on Java 17 because the test environment has available classes.\r\n\r\nFurther work on ECMAScript support using the Nashorn engine dependency on Java 17 is described in [NIFI-9383](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9383).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Meanwhile, all credentials are indeed supported (defined by the `AzureStorageCredentialsType` enum):\r\n\r\n- Account key\r\n- SAS token\r\n- Access token\r\n- Managed identity\r\n- Service principal\r\n\r\nThe logic of the authentication code is that it's a SAS token (provided directly or derived using an account key) or it's based on OAuth2 (which captures the remaining cases).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Apache NiFi

The issue happens on \"thenPartitionContains\" function. And I dive in to \"thenPartitionContains\" function and MockFlowFile interface. And when partition = partition2, I print out the FlowFile attributes by following code:\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.println(flowFile.getAttributes());\r\n``` \r\nAnd I get both flowFiles attributes, which looks like this:\r\n```\r\nFlowFile[1,39513435360922.mockFlowFile,33B]\r\n{record.count=2, filename=39513435360922.mockFlowFile, fragment.index=0, uuid=4de4472c-fce3-4801-bb00-fd81a2c8e95d, path=target, mime.type=text/plain, partition=partition1, fragment.count=2}\r\nFlowFile[2,39513435360922.mockFlowFile,21B]\r\n{mime.type=text/plain, fragment.count=2, record.count=1, path=target, filename=39513435360922.mockFlowFile, partition=partition2, uuid=55e22965-9321-4963-8b39-a9c1160c4da6, fragment.index=1}\r\n```\r\nAs we can see here, when the partition = partition2, the fragment.index is always 1. But what the author set the index parameter is 0. Which is never gonna happen. So I make changes on the place where the \"thenPartitionContains\" get called :\r\n\r\n```\r\nthenPartitionContains(PARTITION_2, 1, 2, PARTITION_2_RECORD_1);\r\nthenPartitionContains(PARTITION_1, 0, 2, PARTITION_1_RECORD_1, PARTITION_1_RECORD_2);\r\n```\r\nBy changing this, the if statement can correctly work and the bug has been fixed. It is not flaky anymore and can pass the NonDex's check.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X]

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10949](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10949) Updates MongoDB Processors and Controller Services to use the current version of `mongodb-driver-sync` in place of `mongodb-driver-legacy`.\r\n\r\nThe updates involve minimal changes to connection setup and `MongoClient` instances as most operations already use current interfaces and classes. The `mongodb-driver-sync` library is a transitive dependency of `mongodb-driver-legacy`, limiting the scope of dependency changes.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include upgrading the MongoDB Driver from 4.7.2 to 4.8.0 and marking the library as provided in `mongodb-processors` and `mongodb-services` as it is provided at runtime through `mongodb-client-service-api-nar`.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

I set several printfs to see why the assertion can not been passed. When I print out the value of \"firstRecord.getGroup(\"mymap\",0)\", it gave me {\"b\" : 2, \"a\" : 1}. However, when the data been initialized at setUp() function in the same class, the data was stored to the record should be {\"a\" : 1,  \"b\" : 2}. I also set the breakpoint before and after the data been read to record1 by following code:\r\n```\r\n        DatumReader<GenericRecord> datumReader = new GenericDatumReader<>(schema);\r\n        DataFileReader<GenericRecord> dataFileReader = new DataFileReader<>(tmpAvro, datumReader);\r\n        GenericRecord record1 = null;\r\n        while (dataFileReader.hasNext()) {\r\n            record1 = dataFileReader.next(record1);\r\n            records.add(record1);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nBefore this code, the map value was {\"a\" : 1,  \"b\" : 2}, and after the code the map value become {\"b\" : 2, \"a\" : 1}. Sadly, the read code implement some third party package which I can not read the source code. Since the original assertion is trying to determine if the data in firstRecord the same as the data we input. So I make two maps which  one of them extracted the value in firstRecord and store the input value in the other to see if they are equal.\r\n\r\nBy changing this, the bug has been fixed and it's not flaky anymore and can pass the NonDex's check.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

I set several printfs to see why the assertion can not been passed. When I print out the value of \"firstRecord.getGroup(\"mymap\",0)\", it gave me {\"b\" : 2, \"a\" : 1}. However, when the data been initialized at setUp() function in the same class, the data was stored to the record should be {\"a\" : 1,  \"b\" : 2}. I also set the breakpoint before and after the data been read to record1 by following code:\r\n```\r\n        DatumReader<GenericRecord> datumReader = new GenericDatumReader<>(schema);\r\n        DataFileReader<GenericRecord> dataFileReader = new DataFileReader<>(tmpAvro, datumReader);\r\n        GenericRecord record1 = null;\r\n        while (dataFileReader.hasNext()) {\r\n            record1 = dataFileReader.next(record1);\r\n            records.add(record1);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nBefore this code, the map value was {\"a\" : 1,  \"b\" : 2}, and after the code the map value become {\"b\" : 2, \"a\" : 1}. Sadly, the read code implement some third party package which I can not read the source code. Since the original assertion is trying to determine if the data in firstRecord the same as the data we input. So I make two maps which  one of them extracted the value in firstRecord and store the input value in the other to see if they are equal.\r\n\r\nBy changing this, the bug has been fixed and it's not flaky anymore and can pass the NonDex's check.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

I set several printfs to see what exactly prints look like. According to the codes, the comment said \"Remove one element from columnTypeMap to simulate it's re-cache partial state\". And right after authors insert the new records. \r\nThe original remove code looks like this:\r\n```\r\nMap.Entry<String, Integer> entry = processor.columnTypeMap.entrySet().iterator().next();\r\nString key = entry.getKey();\r\nprocessor.columnTypeMap.remove(key);\r\n\r\n```\r\nHowever, the set is non-deterministic. So everytime columnTypeMap remove a random key.\r\nInstead, I put a deterministic key to remove which looks like this:\r\n```\r\nprocessor.columnTypeMap.remove(\"TEST_QUERY_DB_TABLE\");\r\n```\r\nThe reason I remove this key because author added back a same key after:\r\n```\r\n        // Insert new records\r\n        stmt.execute(\"insert into TEST_QUERY_DB_TABLE (id, bucket) VALUES (2, 0)\");\r\n\r\n        // Re-launch FlowFile to se if re-cache column type works\r\n        runner.enqueue(\"\".getBytes(), new HashMap<String, String>() {{\r\n            put(\"tableName\", \"TEST_QUERY_DB_TABLE\");\r\n            put(\"maxValueCol\", \"id\");\r\n        }});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy changing this, the bug has been fixed and it's not flaky anymore and can pass the NonDex's check.\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10919](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10919) Corrects Kafka component handling of `SCRAM-SHA-256` and `SCRAM-SHA-512` SASL Mechanism property handling as a result of changes introduced in [NIFI-10819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10819).\r\n\r\nThe changes replace the use of `SaslMechanism.valueOf()` with `SaslMechanism.getSaslMechanism()` to find the matching property value instead of the enumeration name, which does not match property values. Additional changes include new unit tests to validate property handling in referencing classes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10899](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10899) Adds the `SameSite` attribute to all application cookies. The current security configuration applies `SameSite=Strict` to the `__Secure-Authorization-Bearer` Cookie, but no other cookies have the `SameSite` policy applied.\r\n\r\nThe changes implemented add a `SameSitePolicy` enumeration and update the `ApplicationCookieName` enumeration to indicate the policy that will be applied. The implementation applies a `SameSite` attribute to all application cookies to avoid browser warnings and fallback to implicit behavior.\r\n\r\nThe `__Secure-Authorization-Bearer` and `__Secure-Request-Token` cookies are limited to first-party access, so both of those cookies have the `Strict` policy configured.\r\n\r\nThe Logout, SAML, and OIDC cookies require a value of `None` for the `SameSite` attribute because authentication and logout involves redirects between NiFi and external identity providers.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adding the `__Secure` [prefix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#cookie_prefixes) to the the Logout, SAML, and OIDC cookie names .\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Using the information we already have will obviate the need for this additional roundtrip.\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nFor users who may be extending the processor, the `applyBlobMetadata` is still functioning as an extension point – it's being called, but in the default implementation, it does nothing because the information is already available.\r\n\r\n(That is, the call to get blob properties has been made lazy, invoked only if needed.)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x]

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10871](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10871) Adds a new Servlet Filter to the application Spring Security Filter Chain configuration for skipping Cross-Site Request Forgery processing on HTTP requests replicated between cluster nodes.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of CSRF mitigation using the standard Spring Security `CsrfFilter` causes the application to generate and set a `__Secure-Request-Token` cookie on HTTP responses. This is not necessary for requests replicated from one cluster node to another. As a result of the current behavior, requests to cluster nodes can return intermittent HTTP 403 responses when a client web browser sends mismatched `__Secure-Request-Token` Cookie and `Request-Token` Header values.\r\n\r\nSkipping CSRF token generation for cluster replicated requests avoids introducing a new value for the `__Secure-Request-Token` Cookie, which resolves intermittent HTTP 403 responses in clustered deployments. The new `SkipReplicatedCsrfFilter` matches HTTP requests based on the presence of the custom `X-RequestTransactionId`, which the standard Request Replicator applies to replicated requests.\r\n\r\n#
