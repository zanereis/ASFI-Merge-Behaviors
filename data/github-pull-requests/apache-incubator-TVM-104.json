In the case of depthwise conv2d, the input pixels are actually vectorized (not broadcasted as in the case with normal conv2d). This potentially can create opportunities for reusing the data vector across two output pixels. Therefore, adding unroll_kw config option.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this does not bring perf degradation.

TVM only supports pure normal (i.e. sequential) reduction or pure cross-thread reduction. Since TVM has not supported nested reduction yet, one is even unable to schedule a mixed reduction manually. I modified the function that lowers cross-thread reduction, to support mixed reduction as well.\r\n\r\nThe approach is straight forward: First perform normal reduction into local variables in each threads first, and then invoke the original cross-thread reduction intrinsic. It works like this (pseudo-code):\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// Divide the loop nest into two parts\r\nnormal_red = sequantial loops nest\r\ncommon = other loops nest\r\n    \r\n// If normal_red is empty, fallback to original code\r\n\r\nnormal_init = generate init for the temp var\r\nnormal_update = generate sequential reduction on the temp var\r\nbody genereate cross-thread reduction // original code\r\n\r\n// Merge loop nests and add some checks\r\nbody = SeqStmt(normal_init, MergeNest(normal_red, normal_update), body)\r\nbody = MergeNest(common, body)\r\nreturn body\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nA test case is added as a Python unit test.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR to TVM, and I am not sure whom to invite as a reviewer. Since this is compiling pass related, @tqchen can you review my code?","created_at":"2020-03-31T16:07:50Z","updated_at":"2020-04-04T01:50:07Z","closed_at":"2020-04-04T01:49:57Z","merged_at":"2020-04-04T01:49:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b41f4e5523b1f5974a4bdfe4dcc3233903394224","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

(ck, 0, 2) {\r\n        C[((threadIdx.x*2) + ck)] = B[ck]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe direct problem is a wrong predicate for stage B:\r\n\r\n    if (likely((threadIdx.x < 1)))\r\n\r\nA more fundamental cause is that loop nest creation doesn't consider thread/memory hierarchies. In this example, stage B's scope is local.  InferBound, needRelax in particular, doesn't relax the IterVar binding to a threadIdx, because the memory space is only used within the thread.  However, when creating loops, schedule_ops uses the IterVar to offset the index to the memory regardless hierarchies.  This is wrong, as the code uses threadIdx to address local memory. \r\n\r\nThe fix is straightforward -- MakeLoopNest adds the thread bound IterVar to the index only if the storage rank is lower than the thread rank (same the logic as needRelax() in bound.cc).  vthread doesn't need this change, as it doesn't reduce storage scope, i.e. that vthreads still share one local memory space. \r\n\r\nSimilar issue was identified in this thread: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/how-to-avoid-allocating-the-wrong-amount-of-registers-in-cuda-scheduling-in-this-example/5310, although it has more to address.  I add this example as a new test. \r\n\r\nQuestions: \r\n1. I leave \"warp\" with existing behavior to avoid one test failure (tests/python/unittest/test_tir_transform_lower_warp_memory.py). The IR from the test doesn't have the undesired predicate.  Please confirm.\r\n2. The current storage ranks and threads ranks make sense to GPU.  How about other architectures?

PR adds winograd functions and schedules to Conv3D in Topi. I also add an alter op layout pass to pretransform weights along with the associated relay functions. While working writing the relay operators, I noticed quite a bit of inconsistency across various convolution operators and decided to organize them and reduce code duplication. Now, make functions for all convolution variants are shared where possible so that each ND variant doesn't need its own. I also moved all type relationship templates to `convolution.h` rather than have them split across two files.\r\n\r\nNote that unlike conv2d, it is quite common for conv3d to have non-uniform kernel sizes (8x3x3) for example. Thus, this PR includes two variations of conv3d_winograd, one for NxNxN kernels that transforms all axes and one for kernels where KD!=KH,KW where only height and width are transformed.\r\n\r\nI've found that for some workloads this new winograd function can be up to 4X faster than direct convolution.","created_at":"2020-03-31T00:29:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T16:54:35Z","closed_at":"2020-04-05T21:59:39Z","merged_at":"2020-04-05T21:59:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"02eb18332a4f9b9491da0d4e8ed01c49fec2ac5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

To run unit testing in the new `vta-hw` repo, we're introducing the `TVM_PATH` environment variable to point to TVM repo\r\n3. Updated the instructions to reflect that change\r\n4. Turned off building tsim/fsim libraries for VTA by default so average TVM users aren't asked to set these paths\r\n5. Remove VTA sources in `vta-hw` from doxygen -- `vta-hw` will have it's own doxygen generated docs\r\n6.

PR introduces a new way to handle structural hash for the unified IR.\r\n\r\n- Each object can now register an optional SEqualHash function, which\r\n  describes how to reduce its structural equality to sequence of hash values.\r\n- Optionally, the object can choose to allow labeling of vars(e.g. function parameters)\r\n  by calling DefHash\r\n- We implemented a non-recursive structural hasher that maintains its own stack\r\n  to traverse te IR.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves the hash value property from the previous relay's hash utility.\r\nIn particular, the graph node mode hashs a DAG differently from a tree\r\nby attaching an unique occurence index to each graph node.\r\n\r\nIn all of the test cases so far, structural_hash is consistent with structural_equal.\r\n- if structrual(x, y) then structural_hash(x) == structural_hash(y)\r\n- if structural_hash(x) == structural_hash(y) then highly likely structural_equal(x, y)\r\n  - hash no collison is found in our testcases.\r\n\r\nIdeally we should work on automatically generating these functions in the future.\r\n\r\nThe new structural equal is intented to supersede AttrsHash and relay's StructuralHash function.

Bug \r\n\r\nCasting values which are known at compile time results in strange behaviour. For example `1 * tir.Cast(\"bool\", 77)` becomes `77` after the rewrite_simplify pass instead of `1`. \r\n\r\nHowever if that value was passed in at runtime then the expect result of `1` would be printed.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n```\r\nprint(tvm.arith.Analyzer().rewrite_simplify(1 * tir.Cast('bool', 77))) #prints 77\r\n\r\na =te.var('a')\r\nshape = (1,)\r\nc = te.compute(shape,lambda i: 1 * tir.Cast('bool',a))\r\ns = te.create_schedule([c.op])\r\nf = tvm.build(s,[a,c])\r\nc_tvm = tvm.nd.array(np.zeros(shape,dtype='int32'))\r\nf(77,c_tvm) \r\n\r\nassert c_tvm.asnumpy()[0] == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\n\r\nWhen a `Cast(dtype, value)` call is used on a compile time value then it is replaced with an `IntImm` with the `dtype` and `value` from the call. However, the `value` is stored as a C++ `int64_t` and thus does not limit the `value` to a sensible range . If the resulting `IntImm` is later used in an expression that results in a type promotion unexpected behaviour such as the example above occurs where the `Cast` effectively does nothing. \r\n\r\n## Fix \r\n\r\nMy fix is to ensure that as the `IntImm` is created it takes the type bounds into account. After the fix the above example would behave as expected.\r\n```\r\nprint(tvm.arith.Analyzer().rewrite_simplify(1 * tir.Cast('bool', 77))) #prints 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nA review would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n@tqchen @vinx13  @ZihengJiang

PR introduces a new way to handle structural equality\r\nfor both TIR and relay nodes in an extensive way. It can also be used to implement structural equality for other ir nodes, (e.g. te compute graphs) if needed\r\n\r\n- Each object can now register an optional SEqualReduce function, which\r\n  describes how to reduce its structural equality to another instance\r\n  into equality of the children.\r\n- Optionally, the object can choose to allow remapping of vars(e.g. function parameters)\r\n  by calling DefEqual\r\n- We implemented a non-recursive structural equality checker that\r\n  recursively traverses the objects and does the structural equality checking.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a few potential problems in previous relay's AlphaEqual.\r\n\r\n- In particular, the new structural equality relation will be communicative.\r\n- It is can be dangerous to use same_as relation to quickly check equality,\r\n  demonstrated by the following case. (%x, %y) are shared vars between two functions.\r\n```\r\n- function0: fn (%x, %y) { %x + %y }\r\n- function1: fn (%y, %x) { %x + %y }\r\n```\r\nThe new structural equal is intented to supersede AlphaEqual and AttrsEqual.\r\n\r\nFollow-up PRs should be performed to redirect the existing usages, and removes\r\nthe corresponding implementation.\r\n\r\nIdeally we should work on automatically generating these functions in the future.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-27T02:32:42Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T00:01:48Z","closed_at":"2020-03-28T05:21:01Z","merged_at":"2020-03-28T05:21:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"997a14eda9aec3b343e742e55c3018f9dc23d8c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f3ada448951b56d82fd3c7127ce6ad9c52c8c962","head":{"label":"tqchen:structural","ref":"structural","sha":"f3ada448951b56d82fd3c7127ce6ad9c52c8c962","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/re

introduces empty `LLVMModule`, which may appear when all the executable code are optimized #4748 . An empty `LLVMModule` is built from an IR file that only specifies target triplet and data layout.\r\n\r\nWe just notice that existing logic in `LLVMModuleNode` may not consider this case properly. As shown by @trevor-m in this [comment](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4847#issuecomment-600221459), `LLVMModuleNode::GetFunction` doesn't work properly.\r\n\r\nWe dived into this problem and found out that `LLVMModuleNode` always assumes there exists an entry function (see this [line](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/3aabbd9c30d247a31eb19ebf997d6074b14b5dd9/src/target/llvm/llvm_module.cc#L321-L322)). If there is not, e.g., in an empty `LLVMModule`, we would have trouble, mostly in the form of segfault.\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly deals with the empty `LLVMModule` issue in `LLVMModuleNode::GetFunction`. We assume that, without losing generality, a `LLVMModule` is empty if its `entry_func_` cannot be found, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nGetGlobalAddr(runtime::symbol::tvm_module_main) == 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use this assumption as follows:\r\n\r\n1. When `LazyInitJIT` is called by `GetFunction`, we will validate the address of `entry_func_` (by the condition above) first before we refer to it. \r\n2. If `entry_func_` is empty, we can realize the current `LLVMModule` is empty and we should return `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know whether this help address your problem @trevor-m

is part of the infrastructure necessary to support multiple outputs in the BYOC graph partitioning framework. It corresponds to step 3 of the flow outlined [here](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-byoc-an-extended-graph-partitioning-flow/6028) and implements the algorithm described in this [RFC](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/relay-improved-graph-partitioning-algorithm/5830). In summary, it merges together consecutive operators supported by the same target while ensuring that no data dependency issues are created.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends upon the utility functions provided

Bug\r\n\r\nFor operations `<<` and `>>` when the RHS is an IntImm with values that are negative or greater than or equal to the number of bits in the integer being shifted results in LLVM emitting no code for the `tvm.compute`. \r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```\r\na = te.var(name='a', dtype='int32')\r\nshape = (1,)\r\nc = te.compute(shape,lambda i: (4 * a) + (a >> 33))\r\ns = te.create_schedule([c.op])\r\nf = tvm.build(s,[a,c])\r\nprint(\"default_function_compute\" in f.get_source()) #prints False\r\nc_tvm= tvm.nd.array(np.zeros(shape,dtype='int32'))\r\nf(5,c_tvm) \r\nprint(c_tvm.asnumpy()[0]) #prints 0 instead of 20\r\n```\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nLimit the RHS immediate values of `<<` and `>>` to be within a valid range. For example the new behaviour would be: \r\n```\r\na = te.var(name='a', dtype='int64')\r\na << 64 #raises TVMError\r\na << -1 #raises TVMError\r\na >> 31 #no error\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Explanation \r\n\r\nLLVM constant folding silently replaces an out-of-bounds shift to an `undef` as seen [here](https://llvm.org/doxygen/ConstantFold_8cpp_source.html#l01232). Then any other parts of the expression are composed with the undef ( `(4 * a) + undef -> undef` in above example) and become undef as well. Therefore the `tvm.compute` is producing an `undef` which is optimized away by LLVM resulting in no compute code being generated at all.\r\n\r\nA review would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n@tqchen

added in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5033 is a morphological operation, not a standard neural network operator. So putting this inside of image name space seems be to a better choice to me. \r\n\r\nI noticed this when looking at topi/nn directory. There are now dilate.py and dilation2d.py, too similar functions but the former is used for conv transpose (dilate with 0) while the latter is for morphological dilation (dilate with max in the window). I thought it was confusing, so moved dilation2d.py to topi/image. Applied the same fix to Relay as well. \r\n\r\nplease review @kevinthesun @jwfromm @maheshambule I'm sorry I missed this in the original

Our goal is to implement the design described in the RFC here: (). We will contribute these components as separate PRs once the design has been agreed upon.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate what happens, here is a graph before and after the partitioning flow ('add' is supported

For AVX2 and other, there have been no issue. \r\n\r\nEven with the upcast, the raw output from the new test case, quantize -> avgpool -> dequantize, has some gap with torch output.
