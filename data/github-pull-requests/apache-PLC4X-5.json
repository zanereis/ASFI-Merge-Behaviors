[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) from 1.8.0 to 1.9.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">mypy's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>\n<h2>Mypy 1.9</h2>\n<p>We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.9 to the Python Package Index (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mypy/\">PyPI</a>). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>\n<p>Because the version of typeshed we use in mypy 1.9 doesn't support 3.7, neither does mypy 1.9. (Jared Hance, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/16883\">16883</a>)</p>\n<p>We are planning to enable\n<a href=\"https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-local-partial-types\">local partial types</a> (enabled via the\n<code>--local-partial-types</code> flag) later this year by default. This change\nwas announced years ago, but now it's finally happening. This is a\nmajor backward-incompatible change, so we'll probably include it as\npart of the upcoming mypy 2.0 release. This makes daemon and\nnon-daemon mypy runs have the same behavior by default.</p>\n<p>Local partial types can also be enabled in the mypy config file:</p>\n<pre><code>local_partial_types = True\n</code></pre>\n<p>We are looking at providing a tool to make it easier to migrate\nprojects to use <code>--local-partial-types</code>, but it's not yet clear whether\nthis is practical. The migration usually involves adding some\nexplicit type annotations to module-level and class-level variables.</p>\n<h4>Basic Support for Type Parameter Defaults (PEP 696)</h4>\n<p>This release contains new experimental support for type parameter\ndefaults (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0696\">PEP 696</a>). Please try it\nout! This feature was contributed by Marc Mueller.</p>\n<p>Since this feature will be officially introduced in the next Python\nfeature release (3.13), you will need to import <code>TypeVar</code>, <code>ParamSpec</code>\nor <code>TypeVarTuple</code> from <code>typing_extensions</code> to use defaults for now.</p>\n<p>This example adapted from the PEP defines a default for <code>BotT</code>:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>from typing import Generic\nfrom typing_extensions import TypeVar\n<p>class Bot: ...</p>\n<p>BotT = TypeVar(&quot;BotT&quot;, bound=Bot, default=Bot)\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

event loop to each item of the test suite (i.e. session, packages, modules, classes, functions) and allows tests to be run in those loops when marked accordingly. Pytest-asyncio currently assumes that async fixture scope is correlated with the new event loop scope. This prevents fixtures from being evaluated independently from the event loop scope and breaks some existing test suites (see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/706\">#706</a>). For example, a test suite may require all fixtures and tests to run in the same event loop, but have async fixtures that are set up and torn down for each module. If you're affected by this issue, please continue using the v0.21 release, until it is resolved.</p>\n<h2>pytest-asyncio 0.23.5.post1</h2>\n<h1>0.23.5 (2024-02-09)</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Declare compatibility with pytest 8 <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/737\">#737</a></li>\n<li>Fix typing errors with recent versions of mypy <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/769\">#769</a></li>\n<li>Prevent DeprecationWarning about internal use of <code>asyncio.get_event_loop()</code> from affecting test cases <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/757\">#757</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Known issues</h2>\n<p>As of v0.23, pytest-asyncio attaches an asyncio event loop to each item of the test suite (i.e. session, packages, modules, classes, functions) and allows tests to be run in those loops when marked accordingly.

If you're affected by this issue, please continue using the v0.21 release, until it is resolved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/c34da04b82153ce052109bad31ccdbc0be7938e1\"><code>c34da04</code></a> [docs] Mentioned pytest 8.2 compatibility fix in changelog.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/143f745d279afc070cf5cf6144fbf34d960fae72\"><code>143f745</code></a> Fix compatibility with pytest 8.2 FixtureDef.unittest removal</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/13d4b79f7ff0d9d0ea70880b3276f85dea7f1f15\"><code>13d4b79</code></a> Remove unused function <code>_removesuffix</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/cdd2c4906835b6f627d681fbee5d487554884e5f\"><code>cdd2c49</code></a> Use <code>FixtureRequest</code> instead of <code>SubRequest</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/c3429fa4d72239be9b428342f0f1407e0840b9ec\"><code>c3429fa</code></a> Build(deps): Bump packaging from 23.2 to 24.0 in /dependencies/docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/5f2338dfc9f9b5ac2c27d3bef490fa3e2cd7c156\"><code>5f2338d</code></a> Build(deps): Bump pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish from 1.8.12 to 1.8.14</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/726c6e0f3c185f10d8a842bcd1d781de32a3b2f5\"><code>726c6e0</code></a> Build(deps): Bump coverage from 7.4.3 to 7.4.4 in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/8bd8288709717165b352c7f2f207c8e4ef624a01\"><code>8bd8288</code></a> Build(deps): Bump pytest from 8.0.2 to 8.1.1 in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/ef3b3477070d6a270e1bb2c1d438c64dba42724c\"><code>ef3b347</code></a> Build(deps): Bump packaging from 23.2 to 24.0 in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/b22d84e1f0d53920352be4c66d1b6c7f7a9ce005\"><code>b22d84e</code></a> [docs] Fixes the example showing how to run all tests in a session-scoped loop.</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/compare/v0.23.5...v0.23.6\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=pytest-asyncio&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.23.5&new-version=0.23.6)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

[com.google.guava:guava](https://github.com/google/guava) from 33.0.0-jre to 33.1.0-jre.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases\">com.google.guava:guava's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>33.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Request for Android users</h3>\n<p>If you know of Guava Android users who have not yet upgraded to at least the previous release <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v33.0.0\">33.0.0</a>, please encourage them to do so. Starting with that version, we are experimenting with including Java 8+ APIs in <code>guava-android</code>. Before we commit to adding such APIs, we want as much testing as we can get: If we later expose a set of Java 8+ APIs and then discover that they break users, we won't want to remove them, as the removal would break users, too.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-jre/guava-33.1.0-jre.jar\">33.1.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-android/guava-33.1.0-android.jar\">33.1.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/docs/\">33.1.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-jre vs. 33.0.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.0.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated our Error Prone dependency to 2.26.1, which includes a JPMS-ready jar of annotations. If you use the Error Prone annotations in a modular build of your own code, you may need to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">add a <code>requires</code> line for them</a>. (d48c6dfbb8, c6e91c498ced26631029d1bdfdb9154d4a217368)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added a <code>Duration</code> overload for <code>Suppliers.memoizeWithExpiration</code>. (76e46ec35b)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Deprecated the remaining two overloads of <code>Throwables.propagateIfPossible</code>. They won't be deleted, but we recommend migrating off them. (cf86414a87)</li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed a bug that could cause <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/pull/6851#issuecomment-1931276822\">false &quot;recursive load&quot; reports during refresh</a>. (0e1aebf73e)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the return types of <code>transitiveClosure()</code> and <code>reachableNodes()</code> to <code>Immutable*</code> types. <code>reachableNodes()</code> already returned an immutable object (even though that was not reflected in the declared return type); <code>transitiveClosure()</code> used to return a mutable object. The old signatures remain available, so this change does not break binary compatibility. (09e655f6c1)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the behavior of views returned by graph accessor methods that take a graph element as input: They now throw <code>IllegalStateException</code> when that element is removed from the graph. (8dca776341)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Optimized <code>Checksum</code>-based hash functions for Java 9+. (afb35a5d1b)</li>\n<li><code>testing</code>: Exposed <code>FakeTicker</code> <code>Duration</code> methods to Android users. (f346bbb6a7)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the constructors of <code>UncheckedExecutionException</code> and <code>ExecutionError</code> that don't accept a cause. We won't remove these constructors, but we recommend migrating off them, as users of those classes often assume that instances will contain a cause. (1bb3c4386b)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Improved the correctness of racy accesses for J2ObjC users.

(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/934\">Issue 934</a>)</li>\n<li>Improved the error message for so called 'versioned entities' (where entities with <code>0</code> or <code>null</code> ids are always unequal), so it's more discoverable what to do in that situation.

href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases\">com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Error Prone 2.26.1</h2>\n<p>This release contains all of the changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.0\">2.26.0</a>, plus a bug fix to the module name of the annotations artifact <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/9d99ee76f2ca8568b69150f5df7fe845c8545d16\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/9d99ee76f2ca8568b69150f5df7fe845c8545d16</a>)</p>\n<p>Starting in <code>2.26.x</code>, the 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sgammon\"><code>@​sgammon</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4311\">#4311</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Compatibility note:</strong></p>\n<p>Now that the annotations artifact explicit declares a module instead of relying on <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code>, JDK 17 and newer perform stricter module encapsulation checks. Modularized libraries depending on Error Prone annotations <code>2.26.x</code> and newer may see errors like:</p>\n<pre><code>error: package com.google.errorprone.annotations is not visible\nimport com.google.errorprone.annotations.CheckReturnValue;\n                            ^\n  (package com.google.errorprone.annotations is declared in module com.google.errorprone.annotations, but module ... does not read it)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The fix is to add <code>requires static</code> to the module declaration of modularized libraries that depend on Error Prone annotations:</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code> module your.module {\n...\n+  requires static com.google.errorprone.annotations;\n }\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1</a></p>\n<h2>Error Prone 2.26.0</h2>\n<p><strong>Warning: This release contains a bug, please use <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">2.26.1</a> or newer instead.</strong></p>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sgammon\"><code>@​sgammon</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4311\">#4311</a>.</li>\n<li>Disabled checks passed to <code>-XepPatchChecks</code> are now ignored, instead of causing a crash.

initial PR includes,\r\n\r\n1. Modify the cyclic subscription so that it returns PlcValue objects instead of byte[].\r\n2. Cyclic subscriptions now support subscribing to boolean elements.\r\n3. Cyclic subscriptions adapt to the API. Cyclic subscriptions can be made through \"addCyclicTagAddress\".\r\n4. The value transferred as \"pollingInterval\" is tailored to the requirements of the S7 cyclic subscription.\r\n5. Experimentally, support for \"addChangeOfStateTagAddress\" is added.\r\n6.

[github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) from 2.7.1 to 2.7.4.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/releases\">github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Version 2.7.4 Bug Fix Release</h2>\n<p>This release fixes a problem with restoring cursor location properly on Windows.</p>\n<p>It also includes a new stress test for your terminal (FPS monitor) contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/Bios-Marcel\"><code>@​Bios-Marcel</code></a></p>\n<h2>Version 2.7.3 Bug Fix Release</h2>\n<p>This release just updates the terminfo data using current data from Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble).\nIt fixes a regression where we dropped some capabilities including StrikeThrough for some terminals.</p>\n<h2>Version 2.7.2 Improvement Release</h2>\n<p>This release does not add new APIs, but it does improve the functionality of tcell on Windows, and provides an &quot;undocumented&quot; feature for managing the alternate screen buffer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows uses VT mode output everywhere except on ConEmu (because VT output mode on ConEmu is borked for colors)\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>TCELL_VTMODE</code> environment variable can be set to &quot;enable&quot; or &quot;disable&quot; to force attempting to use (or not) this mode.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Windows now uses the alternate screen buffer by default, and preserves the original screen content</li>\n<li>Use of the alternate screen can be disabled setting the <code>TCELL_ALTSCREEN</code> environment variable to &quot;disable&quot;.</li>\n<li>If the alternate screen is disabled in that fashion, we will not clear the screen either.  This is an experimental way to preserve the output from a tcell application on exit or suspend.  Feedback on this would be appreciated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The specific environment variables listed here are <em>not</em> considered part of the Tcell API, and their presence and meaning may change without notice at any time.   Please consider them experimental and let us know whether these are useful or not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/d1364d5937eed5d5ac03b4fec309beb6db26f3eb\"><code>d1364d5</code></a> windows: restore cursor location correctly</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/b02dac3826aa24b2ddc43065f1d2f2a0a1b8c86b\"><code>b02dac3</code></a> fix stress demo (race on close)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/2c305c06d7e13b9998dabecee4592d050db86a74\"><code>2c305c0</code></a> Add little stresser that just draws as much 'random' stuff as possible</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/de408507f9fd2c2b336410c4affa3ca53a532381\"><code>de40850</code></a> terminfo: regenerate all entries</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/6c95e8dbb3814b7d426cc9e282e3b370f80977cf\"><code>6c95e8d</code></a> Try not to clear screen on Windows if TCELL_ALTSCREEN=disable</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/6984e257e4c8ad13320e72873896a4c6f9b25799\"><code>6984e25</code></a> Allow use of TCELL_ALTSCREEN=disable to disable alternate screen.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/552bf3cec141281dddaae171d35f3569f058a1cc\"><code>552bf3c</code></a> windows: Use alt screen by default (supress with TCELL_ALTSCREEN=disable)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/5a591d427559cbb726a23d5883ac3c52d9d41afa\"><code>5a591d4</code></a> Use automargin disable</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/f6c43a3372ec9d9a73f0823235693f62bf50d909\"><code>f6c43a3</code></a> ConEmu fixes - we cannot go to 24-bit mode on that yet.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/cd0fe984d90cf553213160f4449881fdf78a1fe5\"><code>cd0fe98</code></a> Windows: enable VT mode output by default</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/compare/v2.7.1...v2.7.4\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=2.7.1&new-version=2.7.4)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

most notable changes for users are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring of code base into independent modules :man_technologist: :\n<ul>\n<li>The new <code>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</code> contains the well-known maven plugin without maven-site integration dependencies. This will safe some time and bandwidth when using it :hourglass_flowing_sand: .</li>\n<li>The maven-site integration <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/doxia/\">Doxia module</a> has been renamed to <code>asciidoctor-converter-doxia-module</code>. Those using the current one may want to use this for minimal impact.</li>\n<li><strong>A new maven-site integration <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/doxia/\">Doxia module</a></strong> :tada:  has been introduced, <code>asciidoctor-parser-doxia-module</code>. This modules is made to be compatible with the popular <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/skins/maven-fluido-skin/\">Fluido skin</a> and aims to make it easy to write your site docs in AsciiDoc as a drop-in replacement for any other format. No need for custom CSS or other customizations, albeit not all Asciidoctor features are supported yet. Please, report if you want anything added in the following releases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a consequence of the refactoring, the parent project is now called <code>asciidoctor-maven-tools</code> this will reflect in this repository tags, but it's of no consequence for users.</p>\n<p>Another line of work in this release has been the automation of several maintenance tasks :wrench:  to improve the overall shape of the project and facilitate faster and more regular releases 🚀</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of Dependabot to maintain dependencies.</li>\n<li>Several CI improvements and automation of releases via GH Actions.

most notable changes for users are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring of code base into independent modules :man_technologist: :\n<ul>\n<li>The new <code>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</code> contains the well-known maven plugin without maven-site integration dependencies. This will safe some time and bandwidth when using it :hourglass_flowing_sand: .</li>\n<li>The maven-site integration <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/doxia/\">Doxia module</a> has been renamed to <code>asciidoctor-converter-doxia-module</code>. Those using the current one may want to use this for minimal impact.</li>\n<li><strong>A new maven-site integration <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/doxia/\">Doxia module</a></strong> :tada:  has been introduced, <code>asciidoctor-parser-doxia-module</code>. This modules is made to be compatible with the popular <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/skins/maven-fluido-skin/\">Fluido skin</a> and aims to make it easy to write your site docs in AsciiDoc as a drop-in replacement for any other format. No need for custom CSS or other customizations, albeit not all Asciidoctor features are supported yet. Please, report if you want anything added in the following releases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a consequence of the refactoring, the parent project is now called <code>asciidoctor-maven-tools</code> this will reflect in this repository tags, but it's of no consequence for users.</p>\n<p>Another line of work in this release has been the automation of several maintenance tasks :wrench:  to improve the overall shape of the project and facilitate faster and more regular releases 🚀</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of Dependabot to maintain dependencies.</li>\n<li>Several CI improvements and automation of releases via GH Actions. If you see this, this means it worked :smile:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, <strong>thanks to all contributors!
