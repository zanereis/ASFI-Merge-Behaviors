If the refresh succeeds, the repository reconnects the user's\r\n  cluster to JMX and returns it.\r\n- If the refresh fails, the repository disconnects the user's cluster\r\n  from JMX, removes the cluster from the repository, and throws an\r\n  authentication or authorization exception.\r\n\r\nChanges in PulseController:\r\n- If the service call throws an authentication or authorization\r\n  exception, PulseController.  getPulseUpdate() returns a 401 status.\r\n\r\nChanges in pulsescript/common.js:\r\n- If a Pulse ajax call returns a 401 status, ajaxPost() redirects the\r\n  browser to /pulse/clusterLogout to log the user out and request\r\n  re-authorization.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Joris Melchior <joris.melchior@gmail.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Dale Emery <demery@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Pulse is configured to use OAuth, and a user logs out of Pulse,\r\nPulse redirects the browser to a page where the user can take action to\r\nend their session. The available actions depend on the OAuth provider,\r\nbut may include revoking the token or logging out of the OAuth provider\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n- Changed OAuthSecurityConfig to install two logout handlers: A\r\n  RepositoryLogoutHandler (renamed from LogoutHandler) and an\r\n  OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler.\r\n\r\n- Added a pulse.security.oauth.endSessionEndpoint property to specify\r\n  the URL to which the OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler should\r\n  redirect the browser on logout.\r\n\r\n- Configured the OAuthSecurityConfig to add the \"end session endpoint\"\r\n  property value to the client configuration metadata.  On logout, the\r\n  OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler redirects the browser to this\r\n  endpoint, where the user can take action to end the session.\r\n\r\n- In the OAuthClientConfig class (extracted from OAuthSecurityConfig),\r\n  restored the code to explicitly list the scopes that Pulse is\r\n  requesting, in particular to list \"openid\" in the scopes. Though\r\n  authentication works just fine without that explicit list, the\r\n  OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler does not. The\r\n  OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler handles logout only if the the\r\n  principal is an OidcUser. If \"openid\" is not explicitly listed in the\r\n  client's scopes. Spring creates OAuth2User principals instead of\r\n  OidcUser principals, and OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler\r\n  return without redirecting the browser.\r\n\r\nAlso refactored to support the above changes:\r\n\r\n- Moved the oauth client service configuration from OAuthSecurityConfig\r\n  to a new OAuthClientConfig class. This breaks Respository's dependence\r\n  on OAuthSecurityConfig, which in turn (through the LogoutHandler)\r\n  depended on Repository. Repository now gets its\r\n  OAuth2AuthorizedClientService from the OAuthClientConfig class, which\r\n  does not in turn depend on Repository.\r\n\r\n- Marked two Repository constructors as non-required. Spring will pick\r\n  whichever one has the most dependencies it can satisfy. So if the\r\n  profile specifies an OAuth2AuthorizedClientService, Spring will call\r\n  the constructor that takes one of those. Otherwise Spring will call\r\n  the no-args constructor.\r\n\r\n- Renamed LogoutHandler to RepositoryLogoutHandler to better reflect its\r\n  specific responsibilities.\r\n\r\n- Changed RepositoryLogoutHandler to implement LogoutHandler instead of\r\n  LogoutSuccessHandler. Now it does its work *during* logout instead of\r\n  *after.*\r\n\r\n- Changed DefaultSecurityConfig to specify the logout success URL\r\n  directly instead of via a logout success handler. (OAuthSecurityConfig\r\n  no longer needs a logout success URL, because the OIDC logout handler\r\n  redirects to the OAuth provider instead.)\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Dale Emery <demery@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Joris Melchior <joris.melchior@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

new flag is added to gateway senders: group-transaction-events.\r\nIf set to true, events for the same transaction will not be\r\nspread across different batches, i.e. it is guaranteed that\r\nthey will be delivered inside the same batch.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement this behavior,\r\nthe last event for each transaction is marked with a new flag\r\nand the transactionId before it is put in the sender's queue\r\n(new flag added to GatewaySenderEvent). That way, it is possible\r\nfor the gateway senders to go through a\r\nbatch ready to be sent and verify if the last event for\r\neach transaction is present in the batch.\r\nIf not, the gateway sender will traverse the sender queue\r\nto get the missing events for the incomplete transactions\r\nand once they are added to the batch, the batch will be sent.\r\n\r\nThis feature has the following restrictions:\r\n- The group-transaction-events can only be set on\r\nserial gateway senders with just 1 dispatcher thread\r\nor on parallel gateway senders.\r\n- In order to guarantee that the events of a transaction\r\nare to not spread\r\nacross different batches, the regions involved in the\r\ntransaction must all have the same senders with the\r\ngroup-transaction-events flag set to true configured.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
