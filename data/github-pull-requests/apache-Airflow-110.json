order to resolve circular imports as well as to help cleanup the ~2k line cli_parser.py module, all CLI config (declaration of Args, Commands, etc) moved to a new `cli_config.py` module. This config module is much larger than the remaining `cli_parser.py` module and contains more of the original code, so it is perhaps more helpful to think of it as the `cli_parser.py` module has been renamed to `cli_config.py` (where most of the code still lives) and then just the methods related to constructing the parser itself have moved to a new `cli_parser.p`y module :)\r\n\r\nNOTE: you will need to unhide the diffs for these files since they are quite large\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR consistent mostly of code that was created in OpenLineage project. It consists of\r\n\r\n- Provider wiring\r\n- `OpenLineageListener` that uses Listener API to get notification about changes to TaskInstance and Dag states\r\n- `Extractor` framework, which is used to extract lineage information from particular operators. It's ment to be replaced by direct implementation of lineage features in later phase and extracting them using `DefaultExtractor`. This PR does not include actual extractors, but code around using and registering them.\r\n- `OpenLineageAdapter` that translates extracted information to OpenLineage events.\r\n- Utils around specific Airflow OL facets and features\r\n\r\nThis is a base implementation that's not ment to be released yet, but to add code modified to be consistent with Airflow standards, get early feedback and provide canvas to add later features, docs, tests on.\r\n\r\nCloses:

Context\r\n\r\nA while back I made a change to the `ExternalTaskSensor` to properly support soft-fail (see #23647). This was so that I could propagate skipped state - by setting `failed_states=[SKIPPED]` as well as `soft_fail=True`, then my external task sensor would go to skipped state when the upstream task skipped. This works beautifully.\r\n\r\nExcept.\r\n\r\nSometimes my upstream task would fail. I didn't want the fail to propagate instantly, but if it didn't get fixed, retried and succeeded within a given interval, then I wanted the sensor to fail. But with `soft_fail=True` the timeout would result in the sensor going to skipped, not failed. I couldn't have both things.\r\n\r\nSo I've made the (small) change in this PR to have an explicit `skipped_states` on the ExternalTaskSensor, along with the existing `failed_states` and `allowed_states`. It does exactly what you think - if the target task enters a state that's in the `skipped_states` list then the sensor will go to skipped. By default the list is empty, so behaviour is unchanged from before.\r\n\r\nIf you are monitoring multiple tasks, then I made behaviour mimic the `failed_states` list. If any one of the tasks goes to a skipped state, then the sensor goes to skipped - unless a different task entered a failed state at the same time, then it will fail.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n1. New `skipped_states` list on the ExternalTaskSensor\r\n2. Tweaks to the `__init__` to handle validation across all three lists (allowed, skipped, failed)\r\n3. Logic to skip if the target reaches a skipped state\r\n4. Test of the new behaviour\r\n5.

we attempt to run tests in parallel, we quickly check once if Pytest collection works. This is in order to avoid costly parallel test execution if that makes no sense to initialize all the parallel machines. This check used to be done in \"Wait for CI Inages\" step, but running it there has the undesireable side effect that it is not obvious that it's the collection that fails, also it prevents other jobs (for example static checks and docs building) from running. This means that the contributor does not get all the feedback that could be given immediately.\r\n\r\nThis PR separates the collection into separate job and only makes \"test\" jobs depend on it - all the other jobs that need CI image depend on \"wait for CI image\" one and should continue running even if pytest collection fails.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#29903\r\n\r\n---\r\nCurrently the `BaseOperator` overrides the mapped tasks partial arguments by DAG default args when they are provided regardless the value of partial arguments, but by definition, Airflow should uses these default args only when the operator argument is not provided.\r\n\r\nThis PR fills the `partial_kwargs` dictionary with the arguments and kwargs of the partial method, and

- add a mechanism to allow custom waiters to take dynamic values at runtime by editing the waiter config on the fly\r\n    - placeholders for dynamic values are formated for jinja (between {{}})\r\n    - they are meant to be used in the `argument` field, which describes what's checked, this is the only place where we replace them\r\n    - the waiter config still needs to be valid json with those placeholders unexpanded\r\n    - there is some validation, unexpanded parameters will send an error, and jinja will complain if the template is not correctly formated.\r\n\r\n - apply this new capability in transforming appflow `wait_for_completion` code to use a waiter (follow-up on #28869)\r\n    - not using the execution ID in this waiter would mean making unchecked assumptions on the

adds annotations to the following configmap objects:\r\n\r\nWebserver\r\nStatsD\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nWe use spinnaker to deploy this helm chart, however spinnaker by default [versions configmaps](https://spinnaker.io/docs/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/best-practices/#version-your-configmaps-and-secrets). This forces us to fork this helm chart and modify it to work with spinnaker, by adding annotations to disable spinnaker versioning.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/29900\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new `@continuous` Timetable which will always try to start new DAGRuns. \r\n\r\nThe degree of parallelism can be then bounded with the `max_active_dagruns` parameter. \r\n\r\nThis is a little bit different from the currently available approaches:\r\n - It doesn't have the notion of catchup like `schedule_interval=\"* * * * *\"` and can hypothetically run more often\r\n - Its a lot lighter-weight (both in definition and execution) than using a TriggerDagOperator at the end of a DAG.\r\n \r\nTested in Breeze with the following DAG:\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.models.param import Param\r\n\r\ndag = DAG(\r\n    f\"continuous_dag\",\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@continuous\",\r\n    start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1),\r\n)\r\n\r\ntask = BashOperator(task_id=\"the_task\", dag=dag, bash_command=\"sleep 10\", owner=\"nobody!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to work well:\r\n \r\n<img width=\"1893\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16950874/222838739-9c236abb-0fab-49f0-8fb8-c7de18212616.png\">\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds the `active_runs_limit` attribute to the Timetable protocol - Airflow will assert that a DAG's `max_active_runs` is no higher than this value at parse time, and raise an AirflowException if it is higher. This is used in the case of the ContinuousTimetable to ensure that only one DAG is running at any given time (see discussion below).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-03T22:08:11Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T21:47:16Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T19:08:46Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T19:08:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"c1aa4b9500f417e6669a79fbf59c11ae6e6993a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

#29666\r\n\r\n---\r\nCurrently when we provide an empty string for `connections_path`, `variables_path` and `config_path`, Vault secrets backend tries to read the key `/secret_key` instead of `secret_key`. This PR handle the case when those paths are empty string.\r\n\r\n### Why this is necessary?\r\n#29734 added support for multiple mount_point, and these mount points can have different paths for variables, config and secrets, so instead of supporting multiple paths, providing the full secret path with empty string for `connections_path`, `variables_path` and `config_path` can solve the problem.","created_at":"2023-03-03T22:04:53Z","updated_at":"2023-03-04T21:40:47Z","closed_at":"2023-03-04T21:40:46Z","merged_at":"2023-03-04T21:40:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fa91d7540b93420a6c7c43737e3ac881b418873","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1915320862,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTE1MzIwODYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:secrets","name":"area:secrets","color":"d31d93","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/29908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/29908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/29908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/52067ee523512cab66bba2053e1b2bf836e2c619","head":{"label":"hussein-awala:fix/vault_paths","ref":"fix/vault_paths","sha":"52067ee523512cab66bba2053e1b2bf836e2c619","user":{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":531263096,"node_id":"R_kgDOH6pueA","name":"airflow","full_name":"hussein-awala/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala/airflow","description":"Apache

investigating https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/29112 I found another issue in the way that the file task handler checks file access:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9745032fa7e05ea7e45266445db44d153c1adb11/airflow/utils/log/file_task_handler.py#L439-L445\r\n\r\nThe return value of `path.stat().st_mode` will include additional bits beyond the tailing 9 access bits (`-RWXRWXRWX`), which can lead to running `chmod` when it isn't required, as demonstrated here:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pathlib import Path\r\n\r\n>>> p = Path('/opt/airflow/logs/task/mytask')\r\n\r\n>>> new_folder_permissions = 0o755\r\n\r\n>>> p.mkdir(mode=new_folder_permissions, parents=True, exist_ok=True)\r\n\r\n>>> p.stat().st_mode == new_folder_permissions   # Should return true, because we just created this directory\r\nFalse\r\n\r\n>>> format(p.stat().st_mode, 'o')   # Lets look at the full value of `std_mode`, oct-formatted\r\n'42755'\r\n\r\n>>> p.stat().st_mode % 0o1000 == new_folder_permissions   # selecting only the last 9 bits\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the main cause of https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/29112, as there could be remaining issues around kubernetes security groups etc, but I think that this bug could definitely lead to unnecessarily chmod'ing directories without being the owner which could then throw the reported errors.","created_at":"2023-03-02T20:14:04Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T18:17:58Z","closed_at":"2023-03-04T22:43:02Z","merged_at":"2023-03-04T22:43:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec31648be4c2fc4d4a7ef2bd23be342ca1150956","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769748000,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5NzQ4MDAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:logging","name":"area:logging","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

was debugging another issue and running the official helm chart in Kind, and when I tried to run the `example_python_operator` DAG it failed on the `log_sql_query` task with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jinja2/environment.py\", line 969, in _load_template\r\n    template = self.loader.load(self, name, self.make_globals(globals))\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jinja2/loaders.py\", line 126, in load\r\n    source, filename, uptodate = self.get_source(environment,

sql/sample.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich then causes all of the downstream tasks to fail.\r\n\r\nThis is because the template used in the example DAG isn't bundled into the build. I suspect this might work in `breeze` because the source directory is mounted, but when Airflow is installed from pip it won't include this file. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I think that this minor change should fix things.","created_at":"2023-03-02T18:14:58Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T20:49:37Z","closed_at":"2023-03-02T19:46:56Z","merged_at":"2023-03-02T19:46:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"9745032fa7e05ea7e45266445db44d153c1adb11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

parameter that converts the functionality of statsd_invert_allow_list from an allowlist to a blocklist.\r\n\r\nThe reason we need the metric name blocklist on top of a blocklist just for metric tags is because there are legacy metric names that have high cardinality under the definition explored in #29663 like: [`local_task_job.task_exit.<job_id>.<dag_id>.<task_id>.<return_code>`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/jobs/local_task_job.py#L292) that users might want to disable to reduce their metric storage costs.","created_at":"2023-03-02T16:56:12Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T20:54:10Z","closed_at":"2023-03-06T06:20:05Z","merged_at":"2023-03-06T06:20:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"86cd79ffa76d4e4d4abe3fe829d7797852a713a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

TJaniF/airflow-fivetran-tutorial repository yet.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `allow_templates_in_result_processor` parameter to the GithubSensor, False by default to allow for backwards compatibility for users who have built custom operators on top of the GithubSensor. If `allow_templates_in_result_processor` is set to True as the GithubTagSensor now does by default, a dict containing the values of all templated arguments can be passed to the call to `GithubSensor.poke` and within that method to `self.result_processor`. \r\nWithin the GithubTagSensor the `tag_checker` method now pulls the `tag_name` from this passed dictionary instead of using self.tag_name, which was retrieving the template-string before.\r\n\r\nI also added `(BaseGithubRepositorySensor can't be used directly to create Airflow tasks)` to the AirflowException raised when using the BaseGithubRepositorySensor directly in a DAG, because the `Override me.` message alone might be confusing for new Airflow users accidentally using this sensor directly.\r\n\r\nI'm of course very happy to take suggestions on how to better solve this (and better naming 😅 ). I did not make any changes to the test running on the GitHubTagSensor yet because I am not sure how to mock templating in a unittest.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-01T16:13:39Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T12:40:28Z","closed_at":"2023-07-28T11:12:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7f9e90d8925d9a3e002060c75bff32d3e614516","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/29842/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/29842/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/29842/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3f1037aadc3098e0e8a9adfc609bfff72b77abc6","head":{"label":"TJaniF:githubsensor_update","ref":"githubsensor_update","sha":"3f1037aadc3098e0e8a9adfc609bfff72b77abc6","user":{"login":"TJaniF","id":90063506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDYzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90063506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF","html_url":"https://github.com/TJaniF","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TJaniF/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"214874bacecf6283bf05824609dbf9824c02eaa6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Mainly, it is used for BI tools on top of BigQuery. Because BI tools has been used mainly during the working hours, you could save BI Engine cost to use it only during specific time slots.\r\n\r\nThe two operators added`BigQueryBiEngineReservationCreateOperator` and `BigQueryBiEngineReservationDeleteOperator` allows to create and delete BI Engine reservation and a Hook `BigQueryReservationServiceHook`.\r\n\r\nI have decided not to add a new connection for this new hook, because a connection already exist for BigQueryHook. BI Engine is a BigQuery feature, so I hope Airflow users won't be lost.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
