you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

object description of pyflink.table.descriptors.FileSystem\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixed the bug of docstring of pyflink.table.descriptors.FileSystem:1:duplicate object description of pyflink.table.descriptors.FileSystem\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nDeleted duplicated FileSystem in descriptors.py.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem that Flink's bind address in local execution mode is not configurable.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Flink listens to 3 ports in local execution mode, for the following purposes.\r\n1. Rest endpoint\r\n2. Blob server\r\n3. Metrics query RPC service\r\n\r\nWhile binding address for 1 can be configure via `rest.bind-address`, those for 2 & 3 cannot be configured.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Make blob server respect the configuration option 'jobmanager.bind-host' for its binding address.\r\n- Make metrics query RPC service use akka local actor system in local execution mode, to avoid unnecessary port binding.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified by executing jobs in local mode and checking all the network ports the process binds to.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

are 2 problems in this test:\r\n    The Job to be canceled also uses the FailingBlockingInvokable, but we never actually want the Invokable to throw an exception. It should just use a BlockingNoOpInvokable.\r\n    The FailingBlockingInvokable uses static state to control the behavior; if you don't fork the JVM this can result in unexpected behavior in subsequent tests. I believe this is what is happening here; the failing test runs first, sets the blocking flag to false, then the cancel test runs and goes straight to throwing the exception instead of blocking.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a quick fix, but long-term we should find a safe pattern for such stateful Invokables, possibly using factories (similarly to how me changed the setup of

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a way to emit multiple records from\r\nKafkaDeserializationSchema. This is possible through a collector, which\r\nwill buffer deserialized records in a queue and then emit all records\r\natomically. The queue is reused for all incoming Kafka records to\r\nminimize creating new objects on the hot path.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAll existing kafka tests should pass. \r\nAdded:\r\n* org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.KafkaConsumerTestBase#runCollectingSchemaTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport creating hive tables with constraints.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add shim method `createTableWithConstraints`.\r\n  - When creating a hive table, i.e. non-generic, get PK and NOT NULL from table schema and call `createTableWithConstraints`.\r\n  - Add test case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually run the new test with hive-3.1.1 profile.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-07T09:09:51Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T02:30:31Z","closed_at":"2020-05-11T02:13:22Z","merged_at":"2020-05-11T02:13:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"25cbce12d7201642b6031e38583489cd803fb1a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/185f1aa3a6f4cc739d0120828b739b05b582b7e7","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-17452","ref":"FLINK-17452","sha":"185f1aa3a6f4cc739d0120828b739b05b582b7e7","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBump okhttp version to 3.12.11 and 3.14.8 because it could not work with java 8.0.252. Refer to \r\nhttps://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/5970 for more information.\r\n\r\nOkhttp released versions, https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.squareup.okhttp3/okhttp\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Bump okhttp version to 3.12.11 and 3.14.8 and update `NOTICE` file\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* All the existing tests should pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-07T05:22:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:32:13Z","closed_at":"2020-05-16T09:50:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d5646ff25beaff42d2eb6a5ef1f13482bbe1f2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12015/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12015/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12015/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4706730b61045c11fadefc1029deb242318d7cf7","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-17416-okhttp","ref":"FLINK-17416-okhttp","sha":"4706730b61045c11fadefc1029deb242318d7cf7","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nKeyword arguments is a very commonly used feature in Python. We should support it in the PyFlink Descriptor API to make the API more user friendly for Python users.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - add constructor keyword arguments for descriptors in descritors.py \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests in test_descriptors.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to unify slot request timeout handling for streaming and batch tasks regarding whether the slot will be occupied indefinitely.\r\nIt is a pre-requisite of bulk slot allocation so that we do not need to maintain 2 different slot timeout handling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee commits.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit tests for slot occupation*\r\n  - *Existing SlotPoolBatchSlotRequestTest and SlotPoolPendingRequestFailureTest help to verify the change on batch and streaming jobs*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

`print` methods for the representation of the statement execution result.*\r\n  - *Add `JobClient` class that is scoped to a specific job,  including `get_job_id`, `get_job_status`, `cancel`, `stop_with_savepoint`, `trigger_savepoint`, `get_accumulators` and `get_job_execution_result` for job execution result.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Add `test_execute_sql` method

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIAM Roles for Service Accounts have many advantages when deploying Flink on AWS EKS.\r\nFrom AWS documentation:\r\n> With IAM roles for service accounts on Amazon EKS clusters, you can associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account. This service account can then provide AWS permissions to the containers in any pod that uses that service account. With this feature, you no longer need to provide extended permissions to the worker node IAM role so that pods on that node can call AWS APIs.\r\n \r\nIn order to support for IAM Roles for Service Accounts we need to add support for a relatively new authentication method in AWS SDK called WebIdentityToken.\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds support for WebIdentityToken authentication method when using AWS services. This includes S3 and Kinesis.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nS3\r\n  - Bumping AWS SDK dependency to 1.11.754\r\n  - Bumping httpcomponents:httpclient dependency to 4.5.9\r\n  - Added aws-java-sdk-sts dependency\r\n\r\nKinesis\r\n  - Bumping AWS SDK dependency to 1.11.754\r\n  - Added CredentialProvider type for WebIdentityToken\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt is tricky to verify this change by end-to-end test as Kinesalite doesn't support authentication methods. Minio does support it but requires extra containers to be launched to do the actual token verification that will complicate and lengthen the s3 tests. \r\n\r\nAdded configuration unit tests in `AWSUtilTest`\r\n\r\nAs this change is mainly a dependency change, I verified it manually on an actual EKS cluster.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**yes** / no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n\r\nCurrently I could not find the deployment on EKS documented anywhere. If needed i'm willing to add docs if that would be helpful.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-06T13:44:49Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T18:34:47Z","closed_at":"2020-05-14T18:34:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9eff21585f0573419158137a0b86dfeebae892e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278672464,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4NjcyNDY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=FileSystems","name":"component=FileSystems","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12008/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12008/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12008/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/39553c3f639b9a0b744ce3161a16dd9a639664c4","head":{"label":"aroch:master","ref":"master","sha":"39553c3f639b9a0b744ce3161a16dd9a639664c4","user":{"login":"aroch","id":1059299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTkyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1059299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch","html_url":"https://github.com/aroch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":117150200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTcxNTAyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"aroch/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aroch","id":1059299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTkyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1059299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch","html_url":"https://github.com/aroch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aroch/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe PR is to support application mode for the Kubernetes. The start command is very similar to Yarn integration just like following. Non-ha and HA mode both should work as expected.\r\n```\r\nflink run-application -t kubernetes-application \\\r\n    -Dkubernetes.cluster-id=${CLUSTER_ID} \\\r\n    -Dkubernetes.container.image=${FLINK_IMAGE_NAME} \\\r\n    -Djobmanager.memory.process.size=2048m \\\r\n    -Dkubernetes.jobmanager.cpu=1 \\\r\n    -Dkubernetes.taskmanager.cpu=1 \\\r\n    -Dkubernetes.rest-service.exposed.type=NodePort \\\r\n    local:///opt/flink/examples/streaming/WindowJoin.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How to specify user jar and classpath?**\r\nIn native K8s application, when the jobmanager is launched, all the user jar and dependencies have already existed(e.g. built in the image, or downloaded by init-container). \r\n\r\nThe user jar should be specified with schema `local://`, which means it exists in the jobmanager side.\r\n\r\nFor the dependencies, users could put it in the `$FLINK_HOME/usrlib` directory, the jars located in the usrlib will be automatically added to the user classpath. They could also specify the user classpath via `-C/--classpath` of `flink run-application` command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Make flink run-application could support local schema\r\n* Support application mode for kubernetes\r\n* Add e2e tests for Kubernetes application mode\r\n* Set log4j for Kubernetes cli\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n* The changes is covered by new added UT and e2e test(`test_kubernetes_application.sh`)\r\n* Manually test in a real K8s cluster for the non-HA and HA mode\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes the queue declaration in the RabbitMQ Source and Sink consistent. Previously, the Source asserted a durable queue while the Sink asserted a transient queue. This made using the same queue for input and output impossible (as described in the ticket FLINK-17204). The rationale for setting queues to durable by default is taken from the RabbitMQ UI defaults, shown here:\r\n\r\n![rmq-add-new-queue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4655775/81102687-f787a500-8edd-11ea-86ec-4e98551843c4.png)\r\n\r\nThe classes can still be overridden if end users want different default semantics.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - The `RMQSink` asserts durable queues\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added a unit test `RMQSourceTest.testOpenCallDeclaresQueueInStandardMode()`, similar to the existing tests in `RMQSinkTest`, which confirm that the queue is asserted with consistent parameters\r\n- Updated the existing unit tests in `RMQSinkTest` to assert that durable queues are created\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any mention of the current configuration in the JavaDocs [[RMQSink]](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.10/api/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/rabbitmq/RMQSink.html)

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd the implementation of the Oracle dialect for JDBC connectors\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Implemented OracleDialect extending AbstractDialect in JDBCDIalects\r\n- Added default OracleRowConverter\r\n- Added getMergeIntoStatement() into JDBCDialect to handle upsert\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI tested this change connecting directly to a running database (but I didn't cover all the types).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): *no*\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: *no*\r\n  - The serializers: *no*\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): *no*\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: *no*\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: *no*\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR hardens the `TaskCancelerWatchDog` to properly fail the task fatally.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* 59fee01 *Let TaskCancelerWatchDog call TaskManagerActions.notifyFatalError with non-null cause*: In order to avoid NPE we have to call TaskManagerActions.notifyFatalError with non-null arguments. This commit changes the behaviour accordingly.\r\n\r\n* 2ae3c56 *Fail fatally if the TaskCancelerWatchDog encounters exception in run method*: If the TaskCancelerWatchDog encounters an exception in the run method, then we can no longer guarantee that it will do its job. Hence, it is best to fail fatally by letting the exception bubble up so that it is handled by the uncaught exception handler.\r\n\r\n* 9b71bd6 *Harden ExceptionUtils.tryEnrichTaskManagerError, .isMetaspaceOutOfMemoryError and .isDirectOutOfMemoryError to handle null values*: Error handling code should not fail. Hence, this commit changes the methods ExceptionUtils.tryEnrichTaskManagerError, ExceptionUtils.isMetaspaceOutOfMemoryError and ExceptionUtils.isDirectOutOfMemoryError to properly handle a null argument.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nModified `TaskTest#testFatalErrorAfterUnInterruptibleInvoke` and `TaskTest#testFatalErrorOnCanceling` to test that fatal error cause is non-null.\r\n\r\nAdded tests to `ExceptionUtils` which verify that the `#tryEnrichTaskManagerError`, `#isMetaspaceOutOfMemoryError` and `#isDirectOutOfMemoryError` can handle null values.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement LookupableTableSource for Hive connector.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Make `HiveTableSource` implement LookupableTableSource\r\n  - Chang `CommonLookupJoin` to call TypeInfoDataTypeConverter for the type conversion\r\n  - Add test case\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-05T07:29:14Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T02:26:55Z","closed_at":"2020-05-15T01:45:02Z","merged_at":"2020-05-15T01:45:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e6acb6bba04576cb4f967868d10fbbf0c576be1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/99f3bca89ea39ba4b354fee78dcc233394b6477e","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-17387","ref":"FLINK-17387","sha":"99f3bca89ea39ba4b354fee78dcc233394b6477e","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAll methods of Table (and related classes like e.g. GroupedTable) that\r\nexpect expressions as a String were deprecated in favor of the\r\nExpression DSL counterparts. This commit also removes majority of the\r\nusages of the deprecated methods. The remaining methods explicitly test\r\nthe behavior of parsing/converting the String DSL.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAll existing tests should pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnable users to create a JDBC source table using a custom query / prepared statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Managed 'connector.read.query' to create a (read-only) source table using a custom query.\r\n- Currently a read-only Table cannot be created. When a final decision will be taken on that we should set such a flag for tables having such a property\r\n- When a final decision will be made for renaming of connector properties this property could probably become simply 'scan.query', but I decided to left the renaming of those properties to another specific PR\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *JDBCTableSourceSinkFactoryTest* and *JDBCTableSourceITCase*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): *no*\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: *no*\r\n  - The serializers: *no*\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): *no*\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper:*no*\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: *no*\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

We don't support change mode `[I, UA, D]` (`UPDATE_AFTER` without `UPDATE_BEFORE`) in first version. May support it in the future. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- We rename the existing `TableSourceTable` into `LegacyTableSourceTable` and `TableSourceScan` into `LegacyTableSourceScan`, and use `TableSourceTable` and `TableSourceScan` for the new `DynamicTableSource`.\r\n  - We don't want to use `LogicalDynamicTableSourceScan` because the `Dynamic` is verbose and misleading. \r\n  - Besides, `LegacyTableSourceScan` will be dropped in the near future, we can easily remove all `Legacy` classes at that time. \r\n- Implements logical node and physical nodes for `ScanTableSource` and integrate with changelog program.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Introudce a `TestValuesTableFactory` for testing\r\n- Use the `values` source in `TableScanTest` and add validation tests in it. \r\n- Add `DynamicTableSourceITCase` for integration tests \r\n- Add `testChangelog` and `testAggregateOnChangelogSource` for integration tests for changelog source.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- Replace flink-shaded-hadoop dependencies by vanilla Hadoop dependencies\r\nWhy? \r\n- in principle it is better for users to use exactly the same client-hadoop versions as the server components that they are running (instead of relying on some version we are packaging for them)\r\n- The flink-shaded-hadoop dependencies we are providing are known to have issues. The Flink community does not have the capacity to properly maintain them. The old Hadoop2 shaded dependencies are still compatible with Flink after this change.\r\n\r\nOpen TODOs:\r\n- [x] test on EMR 6, with Hadoop 3\r\n- [x] Update Flink documentation\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI verified this change on my personal CI:\r\n- https://dev.azure.com/rmetzger/Flink/_build/results?buildId=7940&view=results\r\n test\r\n(hadoop 2.4.1, hadoop 2.8.3 on JDK11, hadoop 3.1.3) all with e2e tests\r\n\r\nI tested the change on Google DataProc (Hadoop 2.9)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-04T08:36:20Z","updated_at":"2020-05-13T14:28:29Z","closed_at":"2020-05-13T14:28:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6095624297a866ec05782274482d1106924442d8","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d46780f373734f96e1ed78640e9552fcebf63c63","head":{"label":"rmetzger:FLINK-11086-pr","ref":"FLINK-11086-pr","sha":"d46780f373734f96e1ed78640e9552fcebf63c63","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20618957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDYxODk1Nw==","name":"flink","full_name":"rmetzger/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url

LIKE` clause. It does not add a specific option/parameters to the `Operation` stack. The clause is evaluated into a plain `CreateTableOperation` when converting from `SqlCreateTable`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added `INCLUDING/EXCLUDING/OVERWRITING WATERMARKS` option.\r\n    \r\n    The reason to separate the watermarks from generated columns is because we support only a single watermark in a table. This becomes troublesome when user wants to have a watermark on a different column than the source table. The only way this can be achieved without watermarks is to `EXCLUDE GENERATED`. That approach results in dropping the generated columns which might not be intended. I think having a separate WATERMARKS option gives a more fine grained control over the end table.\r\n\r\n  - Moved the validation from `SqlCreateTable#validate` to `SqlToOperationConverter`.\r\n\r\n   With the `LIKE` clause `SqlCreateTable` is not self contained any more. `SqlCreateTable` can e.g. define computed columns on columns inherited from the source table. The validation can be performed only after merging valid features which happens in the `SqlToOperationConverter`.\r\n\r\n  - Throw exception in the legacy planner if the CREATE TABLE ... LIKE is present.\r\n\r\n  We do not support majority of the features that the CREATE TABLE ... LIKE applies to. Therefore in order not to duplicate too much of the code I decided not to support this clause in the old planner.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded tests:\r\n* MergeTableLikeUtilTest - tests the merging logic\r\n* Tests in SqlToOperationConverterTest - tests supporting the like clause in `SqlToOperationConverter`\r\n* Added validation tests in `SqlToOperationConverterTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented) -> docs to be done

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Rich Chinese documents of Flink*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Translate 'docs/training/event_driven.zh.md' to Chinese \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Translate 'docs/training/event_driven.zh.md' to Chinese \r\n  \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - docs/training/event_driven.zh.md\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - This pull request doesn't  introduce a new

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Bundle JMXReporter separately from dist jar,and put it in folder /opt*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not

Now JdbcConnectionOptions supports autoCommit control\r\n   Default behaviour hasn't changed.\r\n- Added logging information to be able to track batches\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis change enables event time alignment for FlinkKafkaConsumer. \r\n\r\nSince this is only an initial draft, I've implemented the change only in FlinkKafkaConsumer, and not pushed it down to AbstractFetcher.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Takes 2 new configurations eventTimeAlignmentIntervalMillis (the interval in which sync should occur) and eventTimeAlignmentThresholdMillis (the threshold value for unalignment beyond which the partition will be paused)\r\n- When periodic watermarks are used, and above parameters are set it will start a new thread to check the alignment in KafkaFetcher \r\n- We keep track of the watermark timestamp at a partition level and then compute the global mininum using GlobalAggregateManager, and the list of partitionsToPause\r\n- Since KafkaFetcher and KafkaConsumerThread are 2 threads, we make use of a EventTimeAlignmentHandover to pass the partitionsToPause to the consumer\r\n- In KafkaConsumerThread run loop, we check if there are any updates in the EventTimeAlignmentHandover pausedPartitions and apply the changes to the KafkaConsumer\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Manually verfied the change by running a local Flink job with parallelism 2, and which listens to 2 kafka topics.   \r\n  - Will add more tests once I get some feedback, total rework might be required so holding it off\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not documented\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-01T09:07:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T19:02:06Z","closed_at":"2023-10-11T19:02:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b861e92f0fe86e8e25b3f996f3db7e33b1cc73f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/732c80e71eb189c784f8d3146751349886652acb","head":{"label":"flipkart-incubator:kafka-source-sync","ref":"kafka-source-sync","sha":"732c80e71eb189c784f8d3146751349886652acb","user":{"login":"flipkart-incubator","id":7090545,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcwOTA1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7090545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator","html_url":"https://github.com/flipkart-incubator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260167313,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNjczMTM=","name":"flink","full_name":"flipkart-incubator/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"flipkart-incubator","id":7090545,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcwOTA1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7090545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator","html_url":"https://github.com/flipkart-incubator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flipkart-incubator/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR binds the user code class loader to the lifetime of a `JobTable.Job` on the `TaskExecutor`. This means that the `TaskExecutor` will not release the user code class loader as long as it contains an allocated slot for the respective job. This will ensure that a `TaskExecutor` can reuse the user code class loader across failovers (task and JM failovers). By reusing user code class loaders Flink will avoid to reload classes and, thus, decrease the pressure it puts on the JVM's metaspace. This will significantly improve situations where a class leak exists because Flink won't deplete the JVM's metaspace under recoveries.\r\n\r\nA side effect is that static class fields won't be reset in case of failovers. This can be considered as behaviour changing.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n#### a1f6040 Introduce `JobTable` which manages the lifecycle of job services on the `TaskExecutor`\r\nThe `JobTable` is a `TaskExecutor` service and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of `TaskExecutor` services which are bound to a job. One of these services is the `LibraryCacheManager` which will created for every job only once.\r\n\r\nOnce the first slot for a new job is requested from the `TaskExecutor` it will create a new `JobTable.Job` entry which is initialized with the job services. As long as the `TaskExecutor` has slots allocated for a job, it will keep the job services running. When the last slot is freed, the `TaskExecutor` will close the `JobTable.Job` and thereby also close all associated services.\r\n\r\nOnce the `TaskExecutor` establishes a connection to the leading `JobManager` for a given job, it will start additional services which are only valid as long as the connection to the `JobManager` exists. In order to model this behaviour, the `JobTable.Job` offers a `JobTable.Job#connect()` method which transforms the `JobTable.Job` into a `JobTable.Connection`. This class can be used to retrieve the required services to talk to the `JobManager` as well as to execute tasks.\r\n\r\nOnce the `TaskExecutor` loses the connection to the leading `JobManager`, the `JobTable.Connection` can be disconnected via `JobTable.Connection#disconnect()`. Calling this method will transform the `JobTable.Connection` into a `JobTable.Job` and closes all services which are only valid as long as the connection to the `JobManager` exists.\r\n\r\nThe `JobTable` replaces the `JobManagerTable` service.\r\n\r\n#### f2fa88e Remove `JobManagerTable` and its implementations\r\n\r\n#### 56a971d Bind job blob lifecycle to `JobTable.Job`\r\n\r\nThe `PermanentBlobCache#registerJob` method registers the use of job-related Blobs. Similarly, `PermanentBlobCache#releaseJob` will release all job-related blobs which makes them eligible for cleanup by the periodic clean up task.\r\n\r\nSince tasks belonging to the same job should be able to share blobs (e.g. jar blobs for the common user code class loader), the `PermanentBlobCache#registerJob` and `PermanentBlobCache#releaseJob` should be bound to the job lifecycle instead of the `Task` lifecycle. This is what this commit achieves by moving the `#registerJob` and `#releaseJob` calls from the `Task` to the `JobTable.Job`. Whenever we create new `JobTable.Job`, we will also call `PermanentBlobCache#registerJob`. We will only call `PermanentBlobCache#releaseJob` when we close `JobTable.Job`.\r\n\r\n#### e176b78 Bind user code class loader to lifetime of `Job` on `TaskExecutor`\r\n\r\nThis commit binds the user code class loader to the lifetime of a `JobTable.Job` on the `TaskExecutor`. This means that the `TaskExecutor` will not release the user code class loader as long as it contains an allocated slot for the respective job. This will ensure that a `TaskExecutor` can reuse the user code class loader across failovers (task and JM failovers). By reusing user code class loaders Flink will avoid to reload classes and, thus, decrease the pressure it puts on the JVM's metaspace. This will significantly improve situations where a class leak exists because Flink won't deplete the JVM's metaspace under recoveries.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this, the `LibraryCacheManager` has been changed. The `LibraryCacheManager` only supports to register a `LibraryCacheManager.ClassLoaderLease` for a given job. As long as there is a single valid `ClassLoaderLease`, the `LibraryCacheManager` will not release the associated user code class loader. A `LibraryCacheManger.ClassLoaderLease` needs to be resolved in order to create and then obtain the user code class loader. This is done via `LibraryCacheManager.ClassLoaderHandle#getOrResolveClassLoader`. Upon calling this method the first time, one specifies the set of jars and class paths the user code class loader should be started with. Every subsequent call to this method will ensure that the underlying class loader contains the set of specified jars and class paths. If this is not the case, then this method will fail. Differently said, the system only supports one user code class loader per job at the moment.\r\n\r\nOnce the owner of the `LibraryCacheManager.ClassLoaderLease` no longer needs the user code class loader, it should call `LibraryCacheManager.ClassLoaderLease#close` in order to invalidate the lease. Once all leases for a given job are invalidate, the `LibraryCacheManager` will release the underlying user code class loader.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there is only a single lease per job which is owned by the `JobTable.Job` and will be created when the `JobTable.Job` will be created. That way we ensure that the user code class loader lives as long as the `JobTable.Job`.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that we reuse the user code class loader as long as the `TaskExecutor` has allocated slots for a given job, `TaskExecutorSlotLifetimeTest#testUserCodeClassLoaderIsBoundToSlot` has been added.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded `DefaultJobTableTest` and `BlobLibraryCacheManagerTest`.\r\n\r\nAdded `TaskExecutorSlotLifetimeTest#testUserCodeClassLoaderIsBoundToSlot` which tests that the user code class loader is reused as long as the `TaskExecutor` has an allocated slot for the job.\r\n\r\nTested manually that a constantly failing job with a class loader leak won't deplete the JVM's Metaspace.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd support CsvRowDataDeserializationSchema and CsvRowDataSerializationSchema for the new data structure RowData. This will be used by new TableSource and TableSink connectors.\r\n\r\nThe implemented CSV schema feature aligns with the exsiting ones. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- `CsvRowDataDeserializationSchema` for deserialize csv `byte[]` into `RowData`.\r\n- `CsvRowDataSerializationSchema` for serialize `RowData` into csv `byte[]`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Ported tests from `CsvRowDeSerializationSchemaTest` to `CsvRowDataSerDeSchemaTest`.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-30T12:56:25Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T03:40:23Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T03:40:19Z","merged_at":"2020-05-06T03:40:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1e436a109c6473b794f02ec0a853d1ae6df6c83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/676245d476a27b37ecb0701333ff5e410a5f44c0","head":{"label":"wuchong:csv-schema","ref":"csv-schema","sha":"676245d476a27b37ecb0701333ff5e410a5f44c0","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce configuration for pool size of io-executor for ClusterEntrypoint and MiniCluster\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd `cluster.io-executor.pool-size` option to let the pool size of io-executor for ClusterEntrypoint and MiniCluster could be configurable. The default behavior would still use the cpu cores of the hardware which the JVM access to.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHBase connector descriptor is already supported since 1.10.0 at Java side. We should also support it in PyFlink.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n - add HBase connector descriptor methods corresponding to java side in descriptors.py\r\n - add HBaseDescriptorTests in test_descriptors.py\r\n - add HBase connector usage documentation in connect.md\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- added HBaseDescriptorTests in test_descriptors.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request fix `byPosition` mode judgement in FieldInfoUtils to support reorder and reorder field properly.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *update file org/apache/flink/table/typeutils/FieldInfoUtils.java*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Add related unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix a bug where an exception was being thrown when a savepoint couldn't be mapped to an ExecutionJobVertex due to the user having specified the operator hash manually\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactored code to make it more explicit that a JobVertex has an operator id and possibly an user defined operator id, this should prevent future similar bugs where this wasn't obvious\r\n- Fixed the bug\r\n- Some code that was only being used in tests got deleted\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- A new unit test was added\r\n- Ideally the creator of the JIRA ticket would verify if the PR fixes their issue\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / *no*)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request fix `byPosition` mode judgement in FieldInfoUtils to support reorder and reorder field properly.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *update file org/apache/flink/table/typeutils/FieldInfoUtils.java*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Add related unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, we do not explicitly set the `RestartPolicy` for the task manager pods in the native K8s setups so that it is `Always` by default.  From the K8s RM perspective, the task manager pod itself must not restart the failed Container, the decision for how to deal with the failed task manager pod must always be made by the active job manager.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR proposes to set the `RestartPolicy` to `Never` for the task manager pods.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Set `Pod.Spec.RestartPolicy` to `Never` in `InitTaskManagerDecorator#decorateFlinkPod`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added a new unit test:\r\n  - `InitTaskManagerDecoratorTest#testRestartPolicy`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPerform alignment for savepoints even if UnalignedCheckpoints are enabled.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n1. Introduce `AlternatingCheckpointBarrierHandler` which delegates to either Aligned or Unaligned barrier handlers\r\n1. Don't notify barrier listener about savepoints in Input Channels\r\n1. Don't include channel state into savepoint snapshots\r\n1. Block upstream on savepoints in UC mode too\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests:\r\n - `AlternatingCheckpointBarrierHandlerTest`\r\n - `CheckpointOptionsTest`\r\n - `testNoNotifyOnSavepoint` for input channels\r\n - `SubtaskCheckpointCoordinatorTest.testSkipChannelStateForSavepoints`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

to use SQL DDL for source/sink definition.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds example and documentation for user to register a table source/sink defined in SQL DDL using TableEnvironment.sql_update() in PyFlink Table API. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nadd example code in python_table_api.md for registering table source/sink defined in SQL DDL using TableEnvironment.sql_update(). And changed the code of  the word count example from TableEnvironment.connect() to TableEnvironment.sql_update().\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as  the word count example in flink-python/pyflink/table/examples/batch/word_count.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd support JsonRowDataDeserializationSchema and JsonRowDataSerializationSchema for the new data structure RowData. This will be used by new TableSource and TableSink connectors.\r\n\r\nThe implemented JSON schema feature aligns with the exsiting ones. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- `JsonRowDataDeserializationSchema` for deserialize `byte[]` into `RowData`.\r\n- `JsonRowDataSerializationSchema` for serialize `RowData` into `byte[]`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added `JsonRowDataSerDeSchemaTest` which covers original `JsonRowDeserializationSchemaTest` and `JsonRowSerializationSchemaTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFlink clusters using zookeeper in HA will not startup if any of the zookeeper hosts passed in the \"high-availability.zookeeper.quorum\" config setting are unreachable (even if the others are). \r\n\r\nSample error:\r\n```\r\njava.net.UnknownHostException: foo-host: Name or service not known\r\n\tat java.net.Inet6AddressImpl.lookupAllHostAddr(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.net.InetAddress$2.lookupAllHostAddr(InetAddress.java:929)\r\n\tat java.net.InetAddress.getAddressesFromNameService(InetAddress.java:1324)\r\n\tat java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName0(InetAddress.java:1277)\r\n\tat java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.java:1193)\r\n\tat java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.java:1127)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.zookeeper.org.apache.zookeeper.client.StaticHostProvider.<init>(StaticHostProvider.java:61) \r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.zookeeper.org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.<init>(ZooKeeper.java:445)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.curator.org.apache.curator.utils.DefaultZookeeperFactory.newZooKeeper(DefaultZookeeperFactory.java:29)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.curator.org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CuratorFrameworkImpl$2.newZooKeeper(CuratorFrameworkImpl.java:150)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.curator.org.apache.curator.HandleHolder$1.getZooKeeper(HandleHolder.java:94)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.curator.org.apache.curator.HandleHolder.getZooKeeper(HandleHolder.java:55)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.curator.org.apache.curator.ConnectionState.reset(ConnectionState.java:262)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.curator.org.apache.curator.ConnectionState.start(ConnectionState.java:109)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.curator.org.apache.curator.CuratorZookeeperClient.start(CuratorZookeeperClient.java:191)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.curator.org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CuratorFrameworkImpl.start(CuratorFrameworkImpl.java:259)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.util.ZooKeeperUtils.startCuratorFramework(ZooKeeperUtils.java:131)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.highavailability.HighAvailabilityServicesUtils.createHighAvailabilityServices(HighAvailabilityServicesUtils.java:123)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.entrypoint.ClusterEntrypoint.createHaServices(ClusterEntrypoint.java:292)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.entrypoint.ClusterEntrypoint.initializeServices(ClusterEntrypoint.java:257)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error seems to stem from us being on an older zookeeper release (3.4.10). This has been fixed as part of: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1576 in the 3.4.x branch (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/commit/be1409cc9a14ac2e28693e0e02a0ba6d9713565e). This change updates our zookeeper dependency to 3.4.14 to pull this fix in. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Flink's ZK in HA mode setup is unable to start up if any of the zk hosts are unreachable\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI manually tested this by invoking the Zookeeper StaticHostProvider class with an invalid host. I've not added an explicit test in Flink as it is covered in the ZK project. \r\n```\r\n       @Test\r\n\tpublic void testStaticHostProviderIssue() throws Exception {\r\n                 // first host is invalid\r\n\t\tString quorum = \"zk666-pa4.hpc.criteo.prod:2181,zk02-pa4.hpc.criteo.prod:2181\";\r\n\t\tConnectStringParser connectStringParser = new ConnectStringParser(quorum);\r\n\t\tHostProvider hostProvider = new StaticHostProvider(connectStringParser.getServerAddresses());\r\n\t\thostProvider.next(10); // next triggers the resolve in the new zk version\r\n\t\thostProvider.next(10);\r\n\t\thostProvider.next(10);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

part 1\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo implement `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, `CREATE`, `DROP` table DDLs for Hive dialect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Implement `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, `CREATE`, `DROP` table syntax\r\n  - Implement a `SqlCreateHiveTable` node which encodes the semantics into properties and takes care of type conversion, e.g. TIMESTAMP => TIMESTAMP(9)\r\n  - Update HiveCatalog to extract semantics from table properties and use it to generate the table.\r\n  - Add tests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added test cases\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-28T13:16:44Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:36:51Z","closed_at":"2020-05-13T03:00:14Z","merged_at":"2020-05-13T03:00:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"78b516ca366e303a0e541aa69bebe1a15ad7a3c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11935/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11935/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11935/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/792bbd1b48b7ff32a47bf3808290d3284bdc0a91","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-17431","ref":"FLINK-17431","sha":"792bbd1b48b7ff32a47bf3808290d3284bdc0a91","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR hardens BashJavaUtilsITCase.\r\n\r\nIn BashJavaUtilsITCase, runBashJavaUtilsCmd.sh locates flink-dist.jar by `find` with pattern `flink-dist*.jar`, but it doesn't filter out the flink-dist*-source.jar built by maven and the flink-dist jar in the original bin directory, so it might get 3 jars as the result, which might break the command depends on it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the result of `find` can be:\r\n```\r\nproject_dir/flink-dist/src/test/bin/../../../target/flink-dist_2.11-1.10.0-sources.jar\r\nproject_dir/flink-dist/src/test/bin/../../../target/flink-1.10.0-bin/flink-1.10.0/lib/flink-dist_2.11-1.10.0.jar\r\nproject_dirflink-dist/src/test/bin/../../../target/flink-dist_2.11-1.10.0.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRestrict the search scope to `-maxdepth 1` under `target` directory, and join the jars found with `:` before adding them to the classpath.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-28T12:58:32Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T08:33:20Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T08:40:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57c90bbbe1577fcfab69b9f065d3693e05eecae7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11934/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11934/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11934/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e1be455034c22ae67943cb5ecda2e4a70f5a844a","head":{"label":"link3280:bugfix/FLINK-17403","ref":"bugfix/FLINK-17403","sha":"e1be455034c22ae67943cb5ecda2e4a70f5a844a","user":{"login":"link3280","id":13482005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDgyMDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13482005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280","html_url":"https://github.com/link3280","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141531345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE1MzEzNDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"link3280/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"link3280","id":13482005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDgyMDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13482005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280","html_url":"https://github.com/link3280","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/link3280/flink","description":"Mirror
