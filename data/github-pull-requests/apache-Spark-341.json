What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntegrate Apache Arrow with Spark to increase performance of `DataFrame.toPandas`.  This has been done by using Arrow to convert data partitions on the executor JVM to Arrow payload byte arrays where they are then served to the Python process.  The Python DataFrame can then collect the Arrow payloads where they are combined and converted to a Pandas DataFrame.  All non-complex data types are currently supported, otherwise an `UnsupportedOperation` exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nAdditions to Spark include a Scala package private method `Dataset.toArrowPayloadBytes` that will convert data partitions in the executor JVM to `ArrowPayload`s as byte arrays so they can be easily served.  A package private class/object `ArrowConverters` that provide data type mappings and conversion routines.  In Python, a public method `DataFrame.collectAsArrow` is added to collect Arrow payloads and an optional flag in `toPandas(useArrow=False)` to enable using Arrow (uses the old conversion by default).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test suite `ArrowConvertersSuite` that will run tests on conversion of Datasets to Arrow payloads for supported types.  The suite will generate a Dataset and matching Arrow JSON data, then the dataset is converted to an Arrow payload and finally validated against the JSON data.  This will ensure that the schema and data has been converted correctly.\r\n\r\nAdded PySpark tests to verify the `toPandas` method is producing equal DataFrames with and without pyarrow.  A roundtrip test to ensure the pandas DataFrame produced by pyspark is equal to a one made directly with pandas.","created_at":"2016-11-09T01:13:18Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T07:22:30Z","closed_at":"2017-06-23T01:04:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2366db9af067ee74f5386c2b69c9581571e403e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/44d7a2a3fedb4f4bec167d763d0df3d6448bbe49","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:wip-toPandas_with_arrow-SPARK-13534","ref":"wip-toPandas_with_arrow-SPARK-13534","sha":"44d7a2a3fedb4f4bec167d763d0df3d6448bbe49","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-09T01:10:56Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T22:34:29Z","closed_at":"2016-11-22T22:18:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36eb2a7f6dddfe1cf1bf60de95e721a0e98fa2f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1b8d56e8e87fc4e3fd48b44ae3ded0d6255d2967","head":{"label":"zsxwing:failOnDataLoss","ref":"failOnDataLoss","sha":"1b8d56e8e87fc4e3fd48b44ae3ded0d6255d2967","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"55964c15a7b639f920dfe6c104ae4fdcd673705c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs of current 2.1, INSERT OVERWRITE with dynamic partitions against a Datasource table will overwrite the entire table instead of only the partitions matching the static keys, as in Hive. It also doesn't respect custom partition locations.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for all these operations to Datasource tables managed by the Hive metastore. It is implemented as follows\r\n- During planning time, the full set of partitions affected by an INSERT or OVERWRITE command is read from the Hive metastore.\r\n- The planner identifies any partitions with custom locations and includes this in the write task metadata.\r\n- FileFormatWriter tasks refer to this custom locations map when determining where to write for dynamic partition output.\r\n- When the write job finishes, the set of written partitions is compared against the initial set of matched partitions, and the Hive metastore is updated to reflect the newly added / removed partitions.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to introduce a method for staging files with absolute output paths to `FileCommitProtocol`. These files are not handled by the Hadoop output committer but are moved to their final locations when the job commits.\r\n\r\nThe overwrite behavior of legacy Datasource tables is also changed: no longer will the entire table be overwritten if a partial partition spec is present.\r\n\r\ncc @cloud-fan @yhuai \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests, existing tests.","created_at":"2016-11-08T20:02:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T01:02:48Z","closed_at":"2016-11-11T01:02:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a821d14c138b2a776500cefa08c469d3a901cdb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/63f7f2ee65a93de7f87f99b9fc46a71deefa5ea5","head":{"label":"ericl:sc-5027","ref":"sc-5027","sha":"63f7f2ee65a93de7f87f99b9fc46a71deefa5ea5","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch significantly improves the IO / file listing performance of schema inference in Spark's built-in CSV data source.\r\n\r\nPreviously, this data source used the legacy `SparkContext.hadoopFile` and `SparkContext.hadoopRDD` methods to read files during its schema inference step, causing huge file-listing bottlenecks on the driver.\r\n\r\nThis patch refactors this logic to use Spark SQL's `text` data source to read files during this step. The text data source still performs some unnecessary file listing (since in theory we already have resolved the table prior to schema inference and therefore should be able to scan without performing _any_ extra listing), but that listing is much faster and takes place in parallel. In one production workload operating over tens of thousands of files, this change managed to reduce schema inference time from 7 minutes to 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nA similar problem also affects the JSON file format and this patch originally fixed that as well, but I've decided to split that change into a separate patch so as not to conflict with changes in another JSON PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests, plus manual benchmarking on a production workload.","created_at":"2016-11-08T20:00:04Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T09:44:26Z","closed_at":"2016-12-03T05:16:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4cedf072eb2ce95b7686bfa1718bfbef52df218f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b01a307499a5b2a00039cb4b195d05a40157438c","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:use-text-data-source-in-csv-and-json","ref":"use-text-data-source-in-csv-and-json","sha":"b01a307499a5b2a00039cb4b195d05a40157438c","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf the rename operation in the state store fails (`fs.rename` returns `false`), the StateStore should throw an exception and have the task retry. Currently if renames fail, nothing happens during execution immediately. However, you will observe that snapshot operations will fail, and then any attempt at recovery (executor failure / checkpoint recovery) also fails.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTest case initialization order under Maven and SBT are different. Maven always creates instances of all test cases and then run them all together.\r\n\r\nThis fails `ObjectHashAggregateSuite` because the randomized test cases there register a temporary Hive function right before creating a test case, and can be cleared while initializing other successive test cases. In SBT, this is fine since the created test case is executed immediately after creating the temporary function.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, we should put initialization/destruction code into `beforeAll()` and `afterAll()`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMinHash currently is using the same `hashDistance` function as RandomProjection. This does not make sense for MinHash because the Jaccard distance of two sets is not relevant to the absolute distance of their hash buckets indices.\r\nThis bug could affect accuracy of multi probing NN search for MinHash.\r\n\r\nMinHash hash distance should just be binary since there is no distance on the buckets.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAn incorrect unit test was also introduced, and it's fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-07T21:36:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T04:47:30Z","closed_at":"2016-11-14T04:47:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8765c8386f0725255073afbd17679bdc7876ca9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6aac8b343c5ea3a91b8517a2d3f47ed055ece9ad","head":{"label":"Yunni:SPARK-18334-yunn-minhash-bug","ref":"SPARK-18334-yunn-minhash-bug","sha":"6aac8b343c5ea3a91b8517a2d3f47ed055ece9ad","user":{"login":"Yunni","id":6089987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODk5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6089987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni","html_url":"https://github.com/Yunni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67909681,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NzkwOTY4MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"Yunni/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yunni","id":6089987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODk5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6089987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni","html_url":"https://github.com/Yunni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yunni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yunni/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport to branch 2.0.\r\n\r\nAs reported in the jira, sometimes the generated java code in codegen will cause compilation error.\r\n\r\nCode snippet to test it:\r\n\r\n    case class Route(src: String, dest: String, cost: Int)\r\n    case class GroupedRoutes(src: String, dest: String, routes: Seq[Route])\r\n\r\n    val ds = sc.parallelize(Array(\r\n      Route(\"a\", \"b\", 1),\r\n      Route(\"a\", \"b\", 2),\r\n      Route(\"a\", \"c\", 2),\r\n      Route(\"a\", \"d\", 10),\r\n      Route(\"b\", \"a\", 1),\r\n      Route(\"b\", \"a\", 5),\r\n      Route(\"b\", \"c\", 6))\r\n    ).toDF.as[Route]\r\n\r\n    val grped = ds.map(r => GroupedRoutes(r.src, r.dest, Seq(r)))\r\n      .groupByKey(r => (r.src, r.dest))\r\n      .reduceGroups { (g1: GroupedRoutes, g2: GroupedRoutes) =>\r\n        GroupedRoutes(g1.src, g1.dest, g1.routes ++ g2.routes)\r\n      }.map(_._2)\r\n\r\nThe problem here is, in `ReferenceToExpressions` we evaluate the children vars to local variables. Then the result expression is evaluated to use those children variables. In the above case, the result expression code is too long and will be split by `CodegenContext.splitExpression`. So those local variables cannot be accessed and cause compilation error.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs the title suggests, this patch moves hash expressions from misc.scala into hash.scala, to make it easier to find the hash functions. I wanted to do this a while ago but decided to wait for the branch-2.1 cut so the chance of conflicts will be smaller.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest cases were also moved out of MiscFunctionsSuite into HashExpressionsSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-05T07:00:52Z","updated_at":"2016-11-05T10:31:25Z","closed_at":"2016-11-05T10:31:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5247b9c8692842f2bb0bb5b80344f01070671fff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3fb33114c5f79230177ba8ec2a962f86e13655b1","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18287","ref":"SPARK-18287","sha":"3fb33114c5f79230177ba8ec2a962f86e13655b1","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**This PR is to backport the fix https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15523 to 2.0.**\r\n\r\nWhen `FilterExec` contains `isNotNull`, which could be inferred and pushed down or users specified, we convert the nullability of the involved columns if the top-layer expression is null-intolerant. However, this is not correct, if the top-layer expression is not a leaf expression, it could still tolerate the null when it has null-tolerant child expressions. \r\n\r\nFor example, `cast(coalesce(a#5, a#15) as double)`. Although `cast` is a null-intolerant expression, but obviously`coalesce` is null-tolerant. Thus, it could eat null.\r\n\r\nWhen the nullability is wrong, we could generate incorrect results in different cases. For example, \r\n\r\n``` Scala\r\n    val df1 = Seq((1, 2), (2, 3)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n    val df2 = Seq((2, 5), (3, 4)).toDF(\"a\", \"c\")\r\n    val joinedDf = df1.join(df2, Seq(\"a\"), \"outer\").na.fill(0)\r\n    val df3 = Seq((3, 1)).toDF(\"a\", \"d\")\r\n    joinedDf.join(df3, \"a\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe optimized plan is like \r\n\r\n```\r\nProject [a#29, b#30, c#31, d#42]\r\n+- Join Inner, (a#29 = a#41)\r\n   :- Project [cast(coalesce(cast(coalesce(a#5, a#15) as double), 0.0) as int) AS a#29, cast(coalesce(cast(b#6 as double), 0.0) as int) AS b#30, cast(coalesce(cast(c#16 as double), 0.0) as int) AS c#31]\r\n   :  +- Filter isnotnull(cast(coalesce(cast(coalesce(a#5, a#15) as double), 0.0) as int))\r\n   :     +- Join FullOuter, (a#5 = a#15)\r\n   :        :- LocalRelation [a#5, b#6]\r\n   :        +- LocalRelation [a#15, c#16]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [a#41, d#42]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the fix, it returns an empty result.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `ExpressionEncoder.serializer.nullable` for flat encoder for a primitive type `false`. Since it is `true` for now, it is too conservative.\r\nWhile `ExpressionEncoder.schema` has correct information (e.g. `<IntegerType, false>`), `serializer.head.nullable` of `ExpressionEncoder`, which got from `encoderFor[T]`, is always false. It is too conservative.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by checking whether a type is one of primitive types. If it is `true`, `nullable` should be `false`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests for encoder and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOnly some of the models which contain a training summary currently set the summaries in the copy method. Linear/Logistic regression do, GLR, GMM, KM, and BKM do not. Additionally, these copy methods did not set the parent pointer of the copied model. This patch modifies the copy methods of the four models mentioned above to copy the training summary and set the parent.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unit tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are the three cases when reading CSV by datasource when it is `PERMISSIVE` parse mode.\r\n\r\n- schema == parsed tokens (from each line)\r\n  No problem to cast the value in the tokens to the field in the schema as they are equal.\r\n\r\n- schema < parsed tokens (from each line)\r\n  It slices the tokens into the number of fields in schema.  \r\n\r\n- schema > parsed tokens (from each line)\r\n  It appends `null` into parsed tokens so that safely values can be casted with the schema.\r\n\r\nHowever, when `null` is appended in the third case, we should take `null` into account when casting the values.\r\n\r\nIn case of `StringType`, it is fine as `UTF8String.fromString(datum)` produces `null` when the input is `null`. Therefore, this case will happen only when schema is explicitly given and schema includes data types that are not `StringType`.\r\n\r\nThe codes below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval path = \"/tmp/a\"\r\nSeq(\"1\").toDF().write.text(path.getAbsolutePath)\r\nval schema = StructType(\r\n  StructField(\"a\", IntegerType, true) ::\r\n  StructField(\"b\", IntegerType, true) :: Nil)\r\nspark.read.schema(schema).option(\"header\", \"false\").csv(path).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nprints\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NumberFormatException: null\r\nat java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:542)\r\nat java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:615)\r\nat scala.collection.immutable.StringLike$class.toInt(StringLike.scala:272)\r\nat scala.collection.immutable.StringOps.toInt(StringOps.scala:29)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.csv.CSVTypeCast$.castTo(CSVInferSchema.scala:24)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+----+\r\n|  a|   b|\r\n+---+----+\r\n|  1|null|\r\n+---+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test in `CSVSuite.scala` and `CSVTypeCastSuite.scala`","created_at":"2016-11-04T13:58:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:43:52Z","closed_at":"2016-11-07T02:54:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82a233fc3fb871fd79629dbdd1f929a5c35d0b78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15767/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15767/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15767/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aa89171ecd888ef0010ef079cfe6439509e8fa6a","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-18269","ref":"SPARK-18269","sha":"aa89171ecd888ef0010ef079cfe6439509e8fa6a","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBased on the discussion in [SPARK-18209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18209). It doesn't really make sense to create permanent views based on temporary views or temporary UDFs. \r\n\r\nTo disallow the supports and issue the exceptions, this PR needs to detect whether a temporary view/UDF is being used when defining a permanent view. Basically, this PR can be split to two sub-tasks:\r\n\r\n**Task 1:** detecting a temporary view from the query plan of view definition.\r\nWhen finding an unresolved temporary view, Analyzer replaces it by a `SubqueryAlias` with the corresponding logical plan, which is stored in an in-memory HashMap. After replacement, it is impossible to detect whether the `SubqueryAlias` is added/generated from a temporary view. Thus, to detect the usage of a temporary view in view definition, this PR traverses the unresolved logical plan and uses the name of an `UnresolvedRelation` to detect whether it is a (global) temporary view.\r\n\r\n**Task 2:** detecting a temporary UDF from the query plan of view definition.\r\nDetecting usage of a temporary UDF in view definition is not straightfoward. \r\n\r\nFirst, in the analyzed plan, we are having different forms to represent the functions. More importantly, some classes (e.g., `HiveGenericUDF`) are not accessible from `CreateViewCommand`, which is part of  `sql/core`. Thus, we used the unanalyzed plan `child` of `CreateViewCommand` to detect the usage of a temporary UDF. Because the plan has already been successfully analyzed, we can assume the functions have been defined/registered. \r\n\r\nSecond, in Spark, the functions have four forms: Spark built-in functions, built-in hash functions, permanent UDFs and temporary UDFs. We do not have any direct way to determine whether a function is temporary or not. Thus, we introduced a function `isTemporaryFunction` in `SessionCatalog`. This function contains the detailed logics to determine whether a function is temporary or not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `PushDownPredicate` rule can create a wrong result if we try to push a filter containing a predicate subquery through a project when the subquery and the project share attributes (have the same source).\r\n\r\nThe current PR fixes this by making sure that we do not push down when there is a predicate subquery that outputs the same attributes as the filters new child plan.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to `SubquerySuite`. @nsyca has done previous work this.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch improves error reporting for FileStressSuite, when there is an error in Spark itself (not user code). This works by simply tightening the exception verification, and gets rid of the unnecessary thread for starting the stream.\r\n\r\nAlso renamed the class FileStreamStressSuite to make it more obvious it is a streaming suite.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is a test only change and I manually verified error reporting by injecting some bug in the addBatch code for FileStreamSink.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-03T19:23:13Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T22:33:04Z","closed_at":"2016-11-03T22:33:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88c38dc72807a72000a41281db3c43c83809ca7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e75f4a5590d0a32c83fc3288c40ffa82ec0235d2","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18257","ref":"SPARK-18257","sha":"e75f4a5590d0a32c83fc3288c40ffa82ec0235d2","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch significantly improves the performance of event log replay in the HistoryServer via two simple changes:\r\n\r\n- **Don't use `extractOpt`**: it turns out that `json4s`'s `extractOpt` method uses exceptions for control flow, causing huge performance bottlenecks due to the overhead of initializing exceptions. To avoid this overhead, we can simply use our own` Utils.jsonOption` method. This patch replaces all uses of `extractOpt` with `Utils.jsonOption` and adds a style checker rule to ban the use of the slow `extractOpt` method.\r\n- **Don't call `Utils.getFormattedClassName` for every event**: the old code called` Utils.getFormattedClassName` dozens of times per replayed event in order to match up class names in events with SparkListener event names. By simply storing the results of these calls in constants rather than recomputing them, we're able to eliminate a huge performance hotspot by removing thousands of expensive `Class.getSimpleName` calls.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by profiling the replay of a long event log using YourKit. For an event log containing 1000+ jobs, each of which had thousands of tasks, the changes in this patch cut the replay time in half:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/19980953/31154622-a1bd-11e6-9be4-21fbb9b3f9a7.png)\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch's changes, the two slowest methods in log replay were internal exceptions thrown by `Json4S` and calls to `Class.getSimpleName()`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/19981052/87416cce-a1bd-11e6-9f25-06a7cd391822.png)\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, these hotspots are completely eliminated.","created_at":"2016-11-03T19:09:59Z","updated_at":"2016-11-05T19:50:28Z","closed_at":"2016-11-05T02:34:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc45d251baa695614b910a2fd36b2f5eb0ea3eb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15756/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15756/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15756/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2717f79b219295a9ba880e759fc454b8d0693859","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:speed-up-jsonprotocol","ref":"speed-up-jsonprotocol","sha":"2717f79b219295a9ba880e759fc454b8d0693859","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR includes several fixes as below:\r\n\r\n**Case 1 `read.json(rdd)`** - throws an exception before the execution for unsupported types.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nval rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(1 to 100).map(i => s\"\"\"{\"a\": \"str$i\"}\"\"\")\r\nval schema = new StructType().add(\"a\", CalendarIntervalType)\r\nspark.read.schema(schema).option(\"mode\", \"FAILFAST\").json(rdd).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Case 2 `read.json(path)`** - throws an exception before the execution for unsupported types.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nval path = \"/tmp/aa\"\r\nval rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(1 to 100).map(i => s\"\"\"{\"a\": \"str$i\"}\"\"\").saveAsTextFile(path)\r\nval schema = new StructType().add(\"a\", CalendarIntervalType)\r\nspark.read.schema(schema).option(\"mode\", \"FAILFAST\").json(path).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case 3 `read.csv(path)`** - throws an exception before the execution for unsupported types.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nval path = \"/tmp/bb\"\r\nval rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(1 to 100).saveAsTextFile(path)\r\nval schema = new StructType().add(\"a\", CalendarIntervalType)\r\nspark.read.schema(schema).option(\"mode\", \"FAILFAST\").csv(path).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case 4 `read.text(path)`** -  throws an exception before the execution for unsupported types  rather than printing incorrect values.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nval path = \"/tmp/cc\"\r\nval rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(1 to 100).saveAsTextFile(path)\r\nval schema = new StructType().add(\"a\", LongType)\r\nspark.read.schema(schema).text(path).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\ncurrently this prints as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----------+\r\n|          a|\r\n+-----------+\r\n|68719476738|\r\n|68719476738|\r\n|68719476738|\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas actual content is\r\n\r\n```\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case 5 `from_json(...)`** - throws analysis exception for unsupported types (`to_json` is already throwing an analysis exception).\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\n\r\nval df = Seq(\"\"\"{\"a\" 1}\"\"\").toDS()\r\nval schema = new StructType().add(\"a\", CalendarIntervalType)\r\ndf.select(from_json($\"value\", schema)).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case 6 `write.json(path)` _(this is a potential issue)_** - adds the schema check in writing\r\n\r\nCurrently, it seems JSON conversion does not support only `CalendarIntervalType` but this case seems already covered as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"SELECT interval 1 seconds as a\").write.json(\"tmp/123\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot save interval data type into external storage.;\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Cannot save interval data type into external storage.;\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.write(DataSource.scala:462)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameWriter.save(DataFrameWriter.scala:215)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameWriter.save(DataFrameWriter.scala:198)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it'd be safe if we add this check like the other text-based datasources. We might add some more types in the future.\r\n\r\nIn more details for **Case 1**, **Case 2** and **Case 3**, there are parsing modes, `FAILFAST`, `DROPMALFORMED` and `PERMISSIVE`. The original behaviour is,\r\n\r\n  - `FAILFAST` - fails if it meets the unsupported type when parsing\r\n\r\n  - `DROPMALFORMED` -  drops record having non-null values in the unsupported types.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids a compilation error due to more than 64KB Java byte code size. This error occur since  generate java code for computing a hash value for a row is too big. This PR fixes this compilation error by splitting a big code chunk into multiple methods by calling `CodegenContext.splitExpression` at `HashExpression.doGenCode`\r\n\r\nThe test case requires a calculation of hash code for a row that includes 1000 String fields. `HashExpression.doGenCode` generate a lot of Java code for this computation into one function. As a result, the size of the corresponding Java bytecode is more than 64 KB.\r\n\r\nGenerated code without this PR\r\n````java\r\n/* 027 */   public UnsafeRow apply(InternalRow i) {\r\n/* 028 */

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen profiling heap dumps from the HistoryServer and live Spark web UIs, I found a large amount of memory being wasted on duplicated objects and strings. This patch's changes remove most of this duplication, resulting in over 40% memory savings for some benchmarks.\r\n\r\n- **Task metrics** (6441f0624dfcda9c7193a64bfb416a145b5aabdf): previously, every `TaskUIData` object would have its own instances of `InputMetricsUIData`, `OutputMetricsUIData`, `ShuffleReadMetrics`, and `ShuffleWriteMetrics`, but for many tasks these metrics are irrelevant because they're all zero. This patch changes how we construct these metrics in order to re-use a single immutable \"empty\" value for the cases where these metrics are empty.\r\n- **TaskInfo.accumulables** (ade86db901127bf13c0e0bdc3f09c933a093bb76): Previously, every `TaskInfo` object had its own empty `ListBuffer` for holding updates from named accumulators. Tasks which didn't use named accumulators still paid for the cost of allocating and storing this empty buffer. To avoid this overhead, I changed the `val` with a mutable buffer into a `var` which holds an immutable Scala list, allowing tasks which do not have named accumulator updates to share the same singleton `Nil` object.\r\n- **String.intern() in JSONProtocol** (7e05630e9a78c455db8c8c499f0590c864624e05): in the HistoryServer, executor hostnames and ids are deserialized from JSON, leading to massive duplication of these string objects. By calling `String.intern()` on the deserialized values we can remove all of this duplication. Since Spark now requires Java 7+ we don't have to worry about string interning exhausting the permgen (see http://java-performance.info/string-intern-in-java-6-7-8/).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI ran \r\n\r\n```\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 100000).count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nin `spark-shell` with event logging enabled, then loaded that event log in the HistoryServer, performed a full GC, and took a heap dump. According to YourKit, the changes in this patch reduced memory consumption by roughly 28 megabytes (or 770k Java objects):\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/19953276/4f3a28aa-a129-11e6-93df-d7fa91396f66.png)\r\n\r\nHere's a table illustrating the drop in objects due to deduplication (the drop is <100k for some objects because some events were dropped from the listener bus; this is a separate, existing bug that I'll address separately after CPU-profiling):\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/19953290/6a271290-a129-11e6-93ad-b825f1448886.png)\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-03T01:24:38Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T00:18:04Z","closed_at":"2016-11-08T00:16:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2597cdd0332fc3fd4123587fedf1b4cd0e359e6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/96621633534e84eb8e9a33c4e7afbec62b776430","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:spark-ui-memory-usage","ref":"spark-ui-memory-usage","sha":"96621633534e84eb8e9a33c4e7afbec62b776430","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

Updated the mustache template (historypage-template.html) to include the uiroot for rendering links to the applications. \r\n\r\nThe existing test was not sufficient to verify the scenario where ajax call is used to populate the application listing template, so added a new selenium test case to cover this scenario.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests and a new unit test. \r\nNo visual changes to the UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-02T23:44:55Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T10:31:10Z","closed_at":"2016-11-09T18:42:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9aa422712de86428777c1f9f0116b1c16945e2d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fcc779d111bed99d3701a2f47a448c3a199e214c","head":{"label":"vijoshi:SPARK-16808_master","ref":"SPARK-16808_master","sha":"fcc779d111bed99d3701a2f47a448c3a199e214c","user":{"login":"vijoshi","id":12079825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDc5ODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12079825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi","html_url":"https://github.com/vijoshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67924661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NzkyNDY2MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"vijoshi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vijoshi","id":12079825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDc5ODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12079825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi","html_url":"https://github.com/vijoshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijoshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vijoshi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis class, like the PartitionedPairBuffer class, are both core Spark data structures that allow us to spill data to disk. \r\n\r\nFrom the comment in ExternalSorter before instantiating said data structures:\r\n// Data structures to store in-memory objects before we spill. Depending on whether we have an\r\n// Aggregator set, we either put objects into an AppendOnlyMap where we combine them, or we\r\n// store them in an array buffer.\r\n\r\nAll of our data within RDDs has a partition ID and the ordering operations will order by a partition before any other criteria. Such data structures share a partitionKeyComparator from WriteablePartitionedPairCollection.\r\n\r\nWhile this change adds more code, it is the bad iterator wrapping we remove that has a negative performance impact. In this case we avoid said wrapping to help the inliner. When avoided we've observed a 3% PageRank performance increase on HiBench large for both IBM's SDK for Java and OpenJDK 8 as a result of the inliner being better able to figure out what's going on.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### The problem in current block matrix mulitiplication\r\n\r\nAs in JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18218 described, block matrix multiplication in spark may cause some problem, suppose we have `M*N` dimensions matrix A multiply `N*P` dimensions matrix B, when N is much larger than M and P, then the following problem may occur:\r\n- when the middle dimension N is too large, it will cause reducer OOM.\r\n- even if OOM do not occur, it will still cause parallism too low.\r\n- when N is much large than M and P, and matrix A and B have many partitions, it may cause too many partition on M and P dimension, it will cause much larger shuffled data size. (I will expain this in detail in the following.)\r\n\r\n### Key point of my improvement\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I introduce `midDimSplitNum` parameter, and improve the algorithm, to resolve this problem.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the improvement in this PR, first let me give a simple case to explain how the current mulitiplication works and what cause the problems above:\r\n\r\nsuppose we have block matrix A, contains 200 blocks (`2 numRowBlocks * 100 numColBlocks`), blocks arranged in 2 rows, 100 cols:\r\n```\r\nA00 A01 A02 ... A0,99\r\nA10 A11 A12 ... A1,99\r\n```\r\nand we have block matrix B, also contains 200 blocks (`100 numRowBlocks * 2 numColBlocks`), blocks arranged in 100 rows, 2 cols:\r\n```\r\nB00    B01\r\nB10    B11\r\nB20    B21\r\n...\r\nB99,0  B99,1\r\n```\r\nSuppose all blocks in the two matrices are dense for now.\r\nNow we call A.multiply(B), suppose the generated `resultPartitioner` contains 2 rowPartitions and 2 colPartitions (can't be more partitions because the result matrix only contains `2 * 2` blocks), the current algorithm will contains two shuffle steps:\r\n\r\n**step-1**\r\nStep-1 will generate 4 reducer, I tag them as reducer-00, reducer-01, reducer-10, reducer-11, and shuffle data as following:\r\n```\r\nA00 A01 A02 ... A0,99\r\nB00 B10 B20 ... B99,0    shuffled into reducer-00\r\n\r\nA00 A01 A02 ... A0,99\r\nB01 B11 B21 ... B99,1    shuffled into reducer-01\r\n\r\nA10 A11 A12 ... A1,99\r\nB00 B10 B20 ... B99,0    shuffled into reducer-10\r\n\r\nA10 A11 A12 ... A1,99\r\nB01 B11 B21 ... B99,1    shuffled into reducer-11\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the shuffling above is a `cogroup` transform, note that each reducer contains **only one group**.\r\n\r\n**step-2**\r\nStep-2 will do an `aggregateByKey` transform on the result of step-1, will also generate 4 reducers, and generate the final result RDD, contains 4 partitions, each partition contains one block.\r\n\r\nThe main problems are in step-1. Now we have only 4 reducers, but matrix A and B have 400 blocks in total, obviously the reducer number is too small.\r\nand, we can see that, each reducer contains only one group(the group concept in `coGroup` transform), each group contains 200 blocks. This is terrible because we know that `coGroup` transformer will load each group into memory when computing. It is un-extensable in the algorithm level. Suppose matrix A has 10000 cols blocks or more instead of 100? Than each reducer will load 20000 blocks into memory. It will easily cause reducer OOM.\r\n\r\nThis PR try to resolve the problem described above.\r\nWhen matrix A with dimension M * N multiply matrix B with dimension N * P, the middle dimension N is the keypoint. If N is large, the current mulitiplication implementation works badly.\r\nIn this PR, I introduce a `numMidDimSplits` parameter, represent how many splits it will cut on the middle dimension N.\r\nStill using the example described above, now we set `numMidDimSplits = 10`, now we can generate 40 reducers in **step-1**:\r\n\r\nthe reducer-ij above now will be splited into 10 reducers: reducer-ij0, reducer-ij1, ... reducer-ij9, each reducer will receive 20 blocks.\r\nnow the shuffle works as following:\r\n\r\n**reducer-000 to reducer-009**\r\n```\r\nA0,0 A0,10 A0,20 ... A0,90\r\nB0,0 B10,0 B20,0 ... B90,0    shuffled into reducer-000\r\n\r\nA0,1 A0,11 A0,21 ... A0,91\r\nB1,0 B11,0 B21,0 ... B91,0    shuffled into reducer-001\r\n\r\nA0,2 A0,12 A0,22 ... A0,92\r\nB2,0 B12,0 B22,0 ... B92,0    shuffled into reducer-002\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nA0,9 A0,19 A0,29 ... A0,99\r\nB9,0 B19,0 B29,0 ... B99,0    shuffled into reducer-009\r\n```\r\n\r\n**reducer-010 to reducer-019**\r\n```\r\nA0,0 A0,10 A0,20 ... A0,90\r\nB0,1 B10,1 B20,1 ... B90,1    shuffled into reducer-010\r\n\r\nA0,1 A0,11 A0,21 ... A0,91\r\nB1,1 B11,1 B21,1 ... B91,1    shuffled into reducer-011\r\n\r\nA0,2 A0,12 A0,22 ... A0,92\r\nB2,1 B12,1 B22,1 ... B92,1    shuffled into reducer-012\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nA0,9 A0,19 A0,29 ... A0,99\r\nB9,1 B19,1 B29,1 ... B99,1    shuffled into reducer-019\r\n```\r\n\r\n**reducer-100 to reducer-109** and **reducer-110 to reducer-119** is similar to the above, I omit to write them out.\r\n\r\n### API for this optimized algorithm\r\n\r\nI add a new API as following:\r\n```\r\n  def multiply(\r\n      other: BlockMatrix,\r\n      numMidDimSplits: Int // middle dimension split number, expained above\r\n): BlockMatrix\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Shuffled data size analysis (compared under the same parallelism)\r\n\r\nThe optimization has some subtle influence on the total shuffled data size. Appropriate `numMidDimSplits` will significantly reduce the shuffled data size,\r\nbut too large `numMidDimSplits` may increase the shuffled data in reverse. For now I don't want to introduce formula to make thing too complex, I only use a simple case to represent it here:\r\n\r\nSuppose we have two same size square matrices X and Y, both have `16 numRowBlocks * 16 numColBlocks`. X and Y are both dense matrix. Now let me analysis the shuffling data size in the following case:\r\n\r\n**case 1: X and Y both partitioned in 16 rowPartitions and 16 colPartitions, numMidDimSplits = 1**\r\nShufflingDataSize = (16 * 16 * (16 + 16) + 16 * 16) blocks = 8448 blocks\r\nparallelism = 16 * 16 * 1 = 256 //use step-1 reducers number as the parallism because it cost most of the computation time in this algorithm.\r\n\r\n**case 2: X and Y both partitioned in 8 rowPartitions and 8 colPartitions, numMidDimSplits = 4**\r\nShufflingDataSize = (8 * 8 * (32 + 32) + 16 * 16 * 4) blocks = 5120 blocks\r\nparallelism = 8 * 8 * 4 = 256 //use step-1 reducers number as the parallism because it cost most of the computation time in this algorithm.\r\n\r\n**The two cases above all have parallism = 256**, case 1 `numMidDimSplits = 1` is equivalent with current implementation in mllib, but case 2 shuffling data is 60.6% of case 1, **it shows that under the same parallelism, proper `numMidDimSplits` will significantly reduce the shuffling data size**.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest suites added.\r\nRunning
