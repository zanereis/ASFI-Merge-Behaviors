#15880  going in, it exposed a potential data race where the MSQ controller would post finish to the workers but still fetch the results from them. \r\nThe change pushes the result fetching before we issue a worker finish. \r\nAs a result of this change, now we would materialize all the rows of the select result in the controller memory. This is okay when `selectDestination=durableStorage` but a little problematic when `selectDestination=taskReport` since the former has a limit of 3000 rows but the later can go wild. \r\n\r\nThe other way would be to hold of finishing the tasks till we write out the task report.

Description\r\nFixes an issue which can occur when using schema discovery on columns with a mix of array and scalar values and querying with scan queries, where SQL result coercion does not expect scalar values to be present and so fails the results. This issue does not occur when grouping, since that homogenizes the results to the least restrictive type.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to repro this is to use the 'kttm' nested example data with full schema discovery, where the language column has a mix of scalar and array values, and then `select *` style query. The error would occur in broker error logs like:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.druid.error.DruidException: Cannot coerce field [language] from type [java.lang.String] to type [ARRAY]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.error.DruidException$DruidExceptionBuilder.build(DruidException.java:460) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.run.SqlResults.cannotCoerce(SqlResults.java:243) ~[classes/:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand present in the web-console something like this:\r\n```\r\nQuery results were truncated midstream! This may indicate a server-side error or a client-side issue. Try re-running your query, or using a lower limit or a longer timeout.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich.. is not a great error message for this scenario I suppose, but is indeed what happens when we explode while coercing results on the fly like this. I'm unsure what a better way to handle this case would be, since it isn't really something the user can retry we might want to figure out a better way to handle this, but maybe out of scope of this PR since we are returning a 200 response code and just happen to fail midway through returning them.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change any behaviors, it just modifies things to be more permissive and allows some queries with mixed array schemas to succeed now where they previously might have failed by wrapping the scalar values into a single element array (which is consistent with the native layer behavior and why none of the other query types have this issue).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-12T00:55:21Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:27:50Z","closed_at":"2024-03-13T06:47:35Z","merged_at":"2024-03-13T06:47:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"795e342ba868e71fbe0a4f33a822e0704b9d370a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

to this patch, the KillTaskReport contained the `numSegmentsKilled` metric, representing the size of unused segments nuked from the metadata store, rather than the actual number of segments killed from deep storage. For instance, there may be cases where an unused segment won't be killed from deep storage if its load spec is in use by another segment. In such cases, only the metadata will be cleaned up. This patch contains a test for this scenario.\r\n\r\nAlternatively and at the very least to avoid any confusion, we can capture both the number of nuked segments from the metadata store and the number of segments killed from deep storage as separate metrics in the KillTaskReport.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

15951](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15951) is more of a gap in the test implementation `TestSegmentsMetadataManager`, where infinity intervals were not handled. In the actual implementation, there is special handling for this case in `appendConditionForIntervalsAndMatchMode`, so segments with eternity intervals will be cleaned up. I have removed the `@Ignore` test annotations and will close the [issue](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15951).\r\n\r\nInstead of extending `TestSegmentsMetadataManager` to match the actual implementation in `SqlSegmentsMetadataManager`, I've removed the unused segment functionality in `TestSegmentsMetadataManager` to make it a no-op. This is because it's too cumbersome to keep the test implementation in sync with the actual implementation, especially as we add more filtering capabilities to `SqlSegmentsMetadataManager`, so it'd be best to treat `SqlSegmentsMetadataManager` as the source of truth for most cases. The only drawback to this approach is that the functional tests are somewhat slower, now requiring the setup of Derby, etc. (e.g., 18s instead of 8s locally).\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nHandling array with boolean literals like `ARRAY[true, false]`\r\n\r\nDruid appears to be able to convert an array with boolean expressions like this array[added=deleted, added=delta] into a numeric array of 0 and 1: `select array[added=deleted, added=delta] from wikipedia`\r\n\r\nHowever, `select array[true, false] from wikipedia` doesn't work. \r\nThis PR fixes this.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidRexExecutor`\r\n * `CalciteArraysQueryTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

This method centralizes the duplicated logic previously spread across six different test cases, reducing code repetition and improving test clarity.\r\n\r\n`getArgumentCaptor` Like the following.\r\n```java\r\n private ArgumentCaptor<Exception> getArgumentCaptor(ServerConfig serverConfig,String errorMessage,boolean haverequest) throws IOException {\r\n    ObjectMapper mockMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);\r\n    HttpServletResponse response = Mockito.mock(HttpServletResponse.class);\r\n    ServletOutputStream outputStream = Mockito.mock(ServletOutputStream.class);\r\n    Mockito.when(response.getOutputStream()).thenReturn(outputStream);\r\n    final AsyncQueryForwardingServlet servlet = new AsyncQueryForwardingServlet(\r\n            new MapQueryToolChestWarehouse(ImmutableMap.of()),\r\n            mockMapper,\r\n            TestHelper.makeSmileMapper(),\r\n            null,\r\n            null,\r\n            null,\r\n            new NoopServiceEmitter(),\r\n            new NoopRequestLogger(),\r\n            new DefaultGenericQueryMetricsFactory(),\r\n            new AuthenticatorMapper(ImmutableMap.of()),\r\n            new Properties(),\r\n            serverConfig\r\n    );\r\n    Exception testException = new IllegalStateException(errorMessage);\r\n\r\n    if(haverequest){\r\n      HttpServletRequest request = Mockito.mock(HttpServletRequest.class);\r\n      Mockito.when(request.getAttribute(AuthConfig.DRUID_AUTHENTICATION_RESULT)).thenReturn(new AuthenticationResult(\"userA\", \"basic\", \"basic\", null));\r\n      IOException testException2 = new IOException(errorMessage);\r\n      servlet.handleQueryParseException(request, response, mockMapper, testException2, false);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      servlet.handleException(response, mockMapper, testException);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ArgumentCaptor<Exception> captor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(Exception.class);\r\n    Mockito.verify(mockMapper).writeValue(ArgumentMatchers.eq(outputStream), captor.capture());\r\n\r\n    return captor;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThis way we only have to focus on whether or not the request was created.\r\n\r\nBefore calling this method, the test case looks like this.\r\n```java\r\n @Test\r\n  public void testHandleQueryParseExceptionWithFilterDisabled() throws Exception\r\n  {\r\n    String errorMessage = \"test exception message\";\r\n    ObjectMapper mockMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);\r\n    HttpServletRequest request = Mockito.mock(HttpServletRequest.class);\r\n    HttpServletResponse response = Mockito.mock(HttpServletResponse.class);\r\n    ServletOutputStream outputStream = Mockito.mock(ServletOutputStream.class);\r\n    Mockito.when(response.getOutputStream()).thenReturn(outputStream);\r\n    final AsyncQueryForwardingServlet servlet = new AsyncQueryForwardingServlet(\r\n        new MapQueryToolChestWarehouse(ImmutableMap.of()),\r\n        mockMapper,\r\n        TestHelper.makeSmileMapper(),\r\n        null,\r\n        null,\r\n        null,\r\n        new NoopServiceEmitter(),\r\n        new NoopRequestLogger(),\r\n        new DefaultGenericQueryMetricsFactory(),\r\n        new AuthenticatorMapper(ImmutableMap.of()),\r\n        new Properties(),\r\n        new ServerConfig()\r\n    );\r\n    Mockito.when(request.getAttribute(AuthConfig.DRUID_AUTHENTICATION_RESULT)).thenReturn(new AuthenticationResult(\"userA\", \"basic\", \"basic\", null));\r\n    IOException testException = new IOException(errorMessage);\r\n    servlet.handleQueryParseException(request, response, mockMapper, testException, false);\r\n    ArgumentCaptor<Exception> captor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(Exception.class);\r\n    Mockito.verify(mockMapper).writeValue(ArgumentMatchers.eq(outputStream), captor.capture());\r\n    Assert.assertTrue(captor.getValue() instanceof QueryException);\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(\"Unknown exception\", ((QueryException) captor.getValue()).getErrorCode());\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(errorMessage, captor.getValue().getMessage());\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(IOException.class.getName(), ((QueryException) captor.getValue()).getErrorClass());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith modifications, the test looks like this.\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testHandleQueryParseExceptionWithFilterDisabled() throws Exception\r\n  {\r\n    String errorMessage = \"test exception message\";\r\n    boolean haveRequest=true;\r\n    ServerConfig serverConfig= new ServerConfig();\r\n    ArgumentCaptor<Exception> captor=getArgumentCaptor(serverConfig,errorMessage,haveRequest);\r\n    Assert.assertTrue(captor.getValue() instanceof QueryException);\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(\"Unknown exception\", ((QueryException) captor.getValue()).getErrorCode());\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(errorMessage, captor.getValue().getMessage());\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(IOException.class.getName(), ((QueryException) captor.getValue()).getErrorClass());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change appears in six test cases, which can make each test case more concise and easy to

Description\r\nThis PR modifies column serializers that use compression to split out the `Closer` so that we don't have to use the one from `SegmentWriteoutMedium.getCloser()`, allowing serializers to optionally release the direct memory that most compression strategies allocateSegmentWriteOutMediummuch earlier than when the segment serialization is completed.\r\n\r\nMost callers still use `SegmentWriteOutMedium.getCloser()` because it doesn't matter too much, but this change allows nested column serialization to use a separate closer associated with an individual `GlobalDictionaryEncodedFieldColumnWriter` (one of these for each field) to release as soon as the nested field is written instead of holding on to them until the entire segment is finished. The main situation this will impact is when there are a very large number of nested fields, as the relatively small amount of direct memory used by each individual buffer (usually 64kb or so) could quickly add up when there are thousands of paths.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to add any direct tests to confirm the buffers are freed prior to the `SegmentWriteOutMedium` itself being closed because all of this stuff is tucked pretty far away and would have to have some gross interface changes to push in an observable closer, but, did at least confirm in the debugger that this is in fact happening. (The same is true of the 'temp' writeout medium these nested columns use to also release the temp files that are no longer needed after the field is serialized, this new closer is closed in the same place). This code path is hit during tests, so existing passing tests should indicate that this change had no negative effect on serialization.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNested column serialization now releases nested field compression buffers as soon as the nested field serialization is completed, which should require significantly less direct memory during segment serialization when many nested fields are present.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

patch adds an EngineFeature \"GROUPBY_IMPLICITLY_SORTS\" and sets it true for native, false for MSQ. It's useful for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1) In the future we'll likely want MSQ to hash-partition for GROUP BY\r\n   instead of using a global sort, which would mean MSQ would not\r\n   implicitly ORDER BY when there is a GROUP BY.\r\n\r\n2) When doing REPLACE with MSQ, CLUSTERED BY is transformed to ORDER BY.\r\n   We should retain that ORDER BY, as it may be a subset of the GROUP BY,\r\n   and it is important to remember which fields the user wanted to include in\r\n   range shard specs.\r\n\r\nDue to (2), this patch fixes an issue where sometimes the `CLUSTERED BY` would be \"forgotten\". The new test case `testReplaceOnFoo1RangeClusteredBySubset` fails without the rest of the patch being applied, because `NumberedShardSpec` is used instead of `DimensionRangeShardSpec`.","created_at":"2024-03-07T21:58:15Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:27:46Z","closed_at":"2024-03-13T15:27:40Z","merged_at":"2024-03-13T15:27:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"910124d4deb7ae1690b28129d26e9623a9455c16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

some followup comments from the change in the metric made in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16020\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIf a datasource has a replicaCount=0 rule that applies to some segments that are not covered by a replicaCount>0 rule, those segments will not be reported as unavailable in segment/unavailable/count. Since they are not queryable by native queries (only using the query from deep storage feature), we want a separate metric that lets us check how many segments fit these criteria.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nAdd metric segment/deepStorage/count that counts the number of segments that are only queryable through the query from deep storage metric.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNew metric to support query from deep storage feature.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidCoordinator`\r\n * `Stats`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n## User Impact\r\n\r\nOnce the core functionality is in, users can pass complex types as dimensions to the group by queries. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT nested_col1, count(*) FROM foo GROUP BY nested_col1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Making grouping strategies type agnostic\r\n\r\nThe grouping engine requires a way to address a dimension and store a fixed-width representation of that dimension on a buffer. This can vary for different types, for example, longs can be represented as is, while strings require a dictionary (runtime, or precomputed) so that a variable length string can be addressed by a fixed width dictionary id.\r\nCurrently, we have a separate strategy for each type. For enabling grouping on complex columns (at the engine level), we need these strategies to be type-agnostic, so that they can work with the supported complex types, without knowing the types. We can also unify the pre-existing types so that the grouping strategies are classified based on the work (and dimensions) that they handle, rather than being specialized for each type. These are the following classifications:\r\n1. Fixed width types - These include numeric primitives. In the future, we can optimize fixed-width complex types, like IPv4 and Geo types to use this strategy instead, with some hints from the type strategy, that the objects can be represented in fixed-width columns. Such types can be serialized into their representations without being mapped to a dictionary, as they are fixed widths.\r\n\r\n2. Variable width types with prebuilt dictionaries - These include string types with prebuilt dictionaries. In the future, once we have a way of extracting array dictionaries from the \"array columns selectors\", we can have array types to use this strategy as well. Such types can be represented using their prebuilt dictionaryId\r\n\r\n3. Variable width types without prebuilt dictionaries - These include any variable type without a prebuilt dictionary, including complex types. We need to build a dictionary + reverse dictionary corresponding to each key and represent the key using the dictionaryId. This also requires a way to estimate the size of the dictionaries and address the key on the dictionary - which requires some interface changes.\r\n\r\n## Implementing a hashing strategy for complex types\r\n\r\nGroup by on complex columns requires that the complex types are addressable from a reverse dictionary.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all the reverse dictionaries are of pre-known types, and hence the dictionary implementations themselves (hash maps) supply the hashCode and equals required to address the object on the dictionary. Dictionaries can be of two types, and we lay down the ins and outs of addressing an object on both the types: \r\n\r\n### Associative array, i.e. HashMap (Object2IntOpenHashMap)\r\n\r\nThis is currently used throughout the code.\r\n\r\nFor any type to be added to a map, it requires the correct implementation of two default methods of Object class\r\n\r\n1. hashCode() : It is required to associate a position in the hash table with the object. Same objects must have the same hashCodes, while different objects can have the same hashcodes as well, which leads to the following point.\r\n\r\n2. equals(): It is required for disambiguating the objects in case of collisions, i.e. when they have the same hashCode.\r\n\r\n### Sorted Set (Object2IntRBTreeMap/ Object2IntAvlTreeMap)\r\n\r\nThis would be a change in the existing dictionary-building strategy, therefore it will affect the performance of array types and string types without a prebuilt dictionary. Hence this change is benchmarked.\r\nThe benefit of using this would be that we can reuse the comparators for addressing the objects in the arrays.\r\nHowever, this affects the performance of the grouping engine, therefore this design is dropped (check the benchmarks section).\r\n\r\n## Grouping on non useful types\r\nShould grouping on types like HLLs, Pairs etc (used for earliest/latest), be allowed or not? There isn’t any practical use case for supporting these types, however, they can fall under the catch-all umbrella, where we serde the type, and compare the byte representation. Therefore, the major question is to or not to?\r\n\r\nCurrently, grouping on these types is disallowed, because they are often counter-intuitive to what the users want to measure. For example, the user might want to group on the finalized estimated count, and rather they are grouping on the sketch itself.\r\n\r\n### Interface changes\r\nFollowing interface changes have been proposed to implement the stuff above:\r\n```java\r\nTypeStrategy.java\r\n\r\npublic interface TypeStrategy<T> extends Comparator<Object>, Hash.Strategy<T>\r\n{\r\n\r\n  ....\r\n  // Whether the type is groupable\r\n  default boolean groupable()\r\n  {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Implement for hashing complex dimensions\r\n  @Override\r\n  default int hashCode(T o)\r\n  {\r\n    throw DruidException.defensive(\"Not implemented. Check groupable() first\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Implement for hashing complex dimensions\r\n  @Override\r\n  default boolean equals(T a, T b)\r\n  {\r\n    throw DruidException.defensive(\"Not implemented.

This can be done in a follow-up PR, without requiring an interface change.\r\n\r\n* Once there’s a way to extract the dictionaries from array selectors, we can reuse those dictionaries, i.e. strategy (2), rather than rebuilding the dictionaries. This requires a new selector class/interface like ArrayColumnValueSelector, akin to  DimensionSelector which would be a massive code change across Druid’s codebase\r\n\r\n* We can hint to the grouping engine about a few complex types being fixed width beforehand - these include the IP types. This would prevent the need for having a dictionary associated with the type, and instead, they can use strategy (1) to directly serialize the type onto the buffer. This will require adding methods to the public interface, which I wanna defer to the future patches\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nGrouping on relevant complex dimensions is supported. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

a reporting bug with running k8s compaction tasks on azure.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThere is logic in AbstractTask.cleanup that lets peons that are running standalone (currently only a thing with k8s mode) push report.json and a status.json after they have completed running. The report.json is a regular task report and the status.json is used by the KubernetesTaskRunner to check the status of the task.\r\n\r\nThis logic assumes that each task is run in isolation, e.g. that a peon will only run a single task. This assumption is not true in two cases, one case where a IndexTask is initialized and run inside a ParallelIndexSupervisorTask and one case where onr or many ParallelIndexSupervisorTask's are initialized and run inside a CompactionTask.\r\n\r\nThe problem with these cases is that both the interior and wrapper tasks try to run cleanup and push their report.json/status.json.\r\n\r\nCurrently this works okay if using amazon s3 as the backend, becasue the s3 client by default overwrites files and the wrapper task pushes its reports last, so the status of task will always be whatever the wrapper task says.\r\n\r\nThe AzureStorage client we wrote doesn't overwrite, so the wrapper task will actually throw a exception when trying to write its reports. The task ends up succeeding anyways because the KubernetesTaskRunner will see the k8s job exit and check status.json (which is successful since the interior task succeeded and pushed its status.json), but this is undesirable behavior.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nThe IndexTask already has a flag for telling it whether it is running standalone or inside another task and check this flag when deciding whether to cleanup. I pulled some of this logic into AbstractTask (since that is where the pushing reports logic is anyways), and added a interface on all tasks called shouldCleanup which defaults to true. The indexTask will return shouldCleanup=false if it is running inside another task. Similarily, ParallelIndexSupervisorTask will also return shouldCleanup=false if it is running inside a compaction task.\r\n\r\nI also updated the azure client to overwrite files by default because this seems to be the default behavior in object stores and it's easier to keep things consistent.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixing bug with kubernetes ingestion and compaction\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AbstractTask`\r\n * `IndexTask`\r\n * `ParallelIndexSuperivsorTask`\r\n * `AzureStorage`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR initiates enhancements in Druid's task management and monitoring framework. It integrates task context into a new `TaskContextReport` and aligns task context tags with metrics reporting for a unified overview. \r\nAdditionally, the introduction of the `TaskContextEnricher` interface focuses on enriching tasks with detailed context information, thereby enhancing monitoring, reporting, and providing deeper insights into task dynamics. A potential future implementation of this interface could, for example, utilize the group-id prefix `coordinator-issued_compact` to classify tasks as part of auto-compaction, subsequently generating appropriate tags for easy identification.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n* Introducing `TaskContextReport` for reporting task context. \r\n* Introduce an experimental `TaskContextEnricher` interface which can be used in extensions to enrich taskContext.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n- `TaskContextEnricher.java` an interface helps provide extra context info about tasks\r\n- `TaskContextReport.java` for reporting task context\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nAdds a new `TypedInFilter` similar to the work done for equality and range filters in #14542, as a replacement for `InDimFilter` which deals in native match value types instead of only supporting string sets. This results in a pretty decent performance increase particularly for matching numeric columns, both when using indexes and matchers, since we don't need to convert the values to do the comparison when the filter match value type matches the underlying column type.\r\n\r\nThe SQL planner uses new `TypedInFilter` whenever `sqlUseBoundAndSelectors` is set to false, which is itself by default tied to `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false` (also the default). This filter does not support default value mode at all, so if `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=true` then this filter will not be used even if `sqlUseBoundAndSelectors` is set to false.\r\n\r\nThe JSON creator for `TypedInFilter`: \r\n```\r\n  @JsonCreator\r\n  public TypedInFilter(\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"column\") String column,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"matchValueType\") ColumnType matchValueType,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"values\") @Nullable List<?> values,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"sortedValues\") @Nullable List<?> sortedValues,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"filterTuning\") @Nullable FilterTuning filterTuning\r\n  )\r\n```\r\naccept either `values` which may or may not be sorted (the constructor checks), and `sortedValues` which is _trusted_ to be sorted. Nearly all callers should just set `values` unless presorting the values, and if the values are already sorted then the O(n) scan of them to check for sortedness should be relatively cheap and will automatically move them to `sortedValues`. The sorting if needed is done lazily, only when doing things like json serialization, computing cache key, or checking if filters are equivalent. The idea is that the values can be sorted by the broker and then be guaranteed to be sorted when serialized to send to the historicals so that they don't have to waste any effort sorting the values.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the SQL planner does serialize these filters when explaining queries, which is the idea behind checking if the values are pre-sorted (and also the same type as the matchValueType parameter) in the constructor, as much of the SQL planning will actually have the values already sorted, the only cases which are not are things like join and lookup rewrites. Hopefully this will be a bit cheaper than building the sorted set that `InDimFilter` uses.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of sorted sets, this new filter uses plain java lists instead of a sorted set, and then `Collections.binarySearch` to locate items within them. Since these value sets are immutable by the time we need to find things in them, the overhead of sorted sets doesn't really bring much to the table, so this doing this binary search instead is slightly faster as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN filters on numeric columns:\r\n```\r\n\"SELECT long2 FROM foo WHERE long2 IN (1, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 46)\",\r\nBenchmark                        (query)

Description\r\nFixes a bug with `LikeFilter` that can occur when using an `extractionFn` that replaces null values with non-null values, such as a lookup with replace missing values set, and then querying a segment with a missing column. In this case, the query would incorrectly check if the like-matcher matched `null` instead of applying the `extractionFn` which might change `null` to not, and choose the incorrect index for the case.\r\n\r\nThe added test models this case, and fails without the changes to `LikeFilter`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test

a bug that can occur when running kubernetes ingestion if a task is cancelled when the job has been created but the pod is still pending.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently, the KubernetesPeonClient.launchPeonJobAndWaitForStart method will treat a job as pending if the corresponding pod has dissapeared and wait until its pod startup timeout before exiting with a timeout.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is incorrect because right before the wait condition, we run getPeonPodWithRetries(jobName), which only returns when the pod has been created. the wait logic is supposed to wait until the pod has been assigned an IP, but if the pod has disappeared when we have already seen it appear, we should not keep waiting since that indicates something has happened to the pod.\r\n\r\nA manifestation of this bad behavior is the error described above, where a task is cancelled but the task runner thread waits in launchPeonJobAndWaitForStart and only exits once its timeout has completed. \r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nThe fix to the immediate bug is pretty straightforward, to have the wait for pod IP logic actually exit with a exception when the pod has disappeared instead of looping waiting for a pod that will never appear.\r\n\r\nI think there is another deeper problem with this logic though, which is that it is generally possible for the kubernetes task runner threads/underlying Kubernetes jobs to hang around waiting while the TaskQueue (which is ultimately responsible for the source of truth of tasks) is unaware of them.\r\n\r\n(background)\r\n- TaskQueue calls KubernetesTaskRunner.getKnownTasks to get the list of tasks that the runner knows are running, then compares this list with its internal state (normally in the metadata DB) and tries to keep the two synced up by issuing run/shutdown calls to the task runner until the states match. in KubernetesTaskRunner, the getKnownTasks checks the tasks map.\r\n- When TaskQueue calls KubernetesTaskRunner.run, the runner adds the task to the tasks map, then submits a task to ListeningExecutorService which will eventually assign a thread to submit the task to kubernetes as a Job, wait for the job to complete, and then report success.\r\n- When TaskQueue calls KubernetesTaskRunner.shutdown, the runner shuts down the Kubernetes job and then removes the task from the tasks map, but expects the ListeningExecutorService thread to exit itself when it sees that the kubernetes job has been deleted.\r\n\r\n(the problem)\r\nthe problem here is that as soon as shutdown is called, the task is removed from the map and no longer returned in getKnownTasks. As far as the taskQueue is concerned, the task is completed and it doesn't need to think about it anymore.\r\n\r\nthis assumption is fine when tasks run to completion, because the ListeningExecutorService thread completing the task run future is the thing that actually tells TaskQueue that the task is completed and it can call shutdown on the task. in this case everything happens in the order we want it to (ListeningExecutorService thread exits -> taskQueue sees task is complete -> task runner cleans up task)\r\n\r\nthis assumption doesn't always work when tasks are cancelled, because the TaskQueue itself initiates the shutdown, the KubernetesTaskRunner reports the task as shutdown, then expects the ListeningExecutorService thread to exit. However, there is nothing actually making sure that the thread will exit properly here. This bug (where the thread waits on the disappeared pod), is a example of undefined behavior by the thread. \r\n\r\nThere are other race conditions possible where the thread is running the code to spin up the job, but before the job is created, the task is cancelled and reported as shutdown by the KubernetesTaskRunner, and then the thread subsequently creates the job and starts running in the background even though druid thinks the task has completed.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I think KubernetesTaskRunner should not remove the task from the tasks map (aka inform TaskQueue that the task is shutdown), until the underlying executor thread has actually completed the task run future.\r\n\r\nIn the normal task run case, this doesn't change anything since the normal behavior is executor thread finishes task run future -> task queue notices -> shutdown KubernetesTaskRunner (the future would obviously already be completed at this point since it kicks off the whole process).\r\n\r\nIn the task cancellation case, the first shutdown call would delete the k8s job but not remove the task from the tasks map. the next time the task queue runs its internal management loop, it would see the task still being reported in getKnownTasks and issue another shutdown call. at this point the future should have completed and the task should be removed from the tasks map.\r\n\r\nin the case of the wait for disappeared bug, this wouldn't actually have helped, since the future would have been still running forever and taskQueue would have periodically issued shutdown calls that did nothing (that bug still needs to be fixed directly).\r\n\r\nin the case of a race condition, the job would actually get shutdown by TaskQueue since it would see the future still running, so we wouldn't have a errant job running. in general i think this behavior (don't report a task as done until the task runner is sure its done) makes more sense too\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix scheduling bugs with Kubernetes ingestion.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\n1. This PR creates an interface for ImmutableRTree and moved the existing implementation to new class which represent 32 bit implementation (stores coordinate as floats). This PR makes the ImmutableRTree extendable to create higher precision implementation as well (64 bit).\r\n2. In all spatial bound filters, we accept float as input which might not be accurate in the case of high precision implementation of ImmutableRTree. This PR changed the bound filters to accepts the query bounds as double instead of float and it is backward compatible change as it compares double to existing float values in RTree.  Previously it was comparing input float to RTree floats which can cause precision loss, now it is little better as it compares double to float which is still not 100% accurate.\r\n3.  There are no changes in the way that we query spatial dimension today except input bound parsing. There is little improvement in string filter predicate which now parse double strings instead of float and compares double to double which is 100% accurate but string predicate is only called when we dont have spatial index. \r\n4. With allowing the interface to extend ImmutableRTree, we allow to create high precision (HP) implementation and defines new search strategies to perform HP search `Iterable<ImmutableBitmap> search(ImmutableDoubleNode node, Bound bound);`\r\n5. With possible HP implementations, Radius bound filter can not really focus on accuracy, it is calculating Euclidean distance in comparing. As EARTH 🌍  is round and not flat, Euclidean distances are not accurate in geo system. This PR adds new param called 'radiusUnit' which allows you to specify units like meters, km, miles etc. It uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula to check if given geo point falls inside circle or not. Added a test that generates set of points inside and outside in RadiusBoundTest.\r\n\r\nPR is fully backward compatible. Let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n`\r\nAdding radiusUnit in Radius Bound filter. \r\nradiusUnit : String value of radius unit in lowercase, default value is 'euclidean'. Allowed units are euclidean, meters, miles, kilometers.\r\n`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

a load rule specifies replicaCount=0, the affected segments will not be loaded onto historicals but they are queryable via the multi-stage-query engine. Currently these segments will be labeled as unavailable in segment/unavailable/count which seems wrong to me since that metric indicates that segments still need to be loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe behavior is also different from segment/underReplicated/count since that metric does not include replicaCount=0 segments as unavailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen checking whether to label a segment as unavailable for the purposes of the segment/unavailable/count metric, check whether the required replicas is 0, in which case the segment should not be marked as unavailable.\r\n\r\nThe segment/underReplicated/count already does this\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nThis is a small one-line change to exclude non-historical segments from being marked as unavailable.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

certain cases, joins run as broadcast even when the user hinted that they wanted sortMerge. This happens when the sortMerge algorithm is unable to process the join, because it isn't a direct comparison between two fields on the LHS and RHS.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, the error message from BroadcastTablesTooLargeFault is quite confusing, since it mentions that you should try sortMerge to fix it. But the user may have already configured sortMerge.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes it by having two error messages, based on whether broadcast join was used as a primary selection or as a fallback
