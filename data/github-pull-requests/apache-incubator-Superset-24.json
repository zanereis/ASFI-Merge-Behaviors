SUMMARY\r\nImplements changes from discussion https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/27557\r\n\r\n1. Remove the Recommended tags section and move the charts in \"Popular\" to a \"Featured\" section underneath All Charts, \"Featured\" is selected by default\r\n2. Remove the following tags:\r\n- Aesthetic\r\n- Coordinates\r\n- Deprecated\r\n- Description\r\n- Discrete\r\n- Experimental\r\n- Vertical\r\n3. Bar Chart (legacy) : Remove Popular/Featured tag from Bar Chart (legacy)\r\n4. Collapse Tags section by default\r\n\r\nAlso, refactored the svg icons used in viz picker (ballot, category, tags) as their viewboxes were weird, which resulted in additional css used to make them look good\r\n\r\nCC @yousoph \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\"

SUMMARY\r\nDue to a bug in `useChildElementTruncation`, there was an edge case which could trigger an infinite loop of rerenders. The bug occurs when the difference in width of subsequent numbers after the plus sign (e.g. +4 and +5) is just big enough to change the truncation state to the other number. This PR ensures that the calculation is performed only once, and if the edge case is triggered, we simply accept the off-by-one error.\r\nThis PR also implements a ResizeObserver which recalculates the truncations if the container size changes. Previously we relied on the width values from references in `useLayoutEffect`'s dependency array, which was not a correct approach, since the changes of those values would not trigger a rerender.\r\n\r\nThis change allowed us to bring back the feature that relied on the truncation logic, which is dashboard cross links on Chart List page. The feature adds a column to the list which displays the dashboards that given chart is added to.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore (occurred long ago when \"dashboards added to\" column was not yet hidden):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/d68fb59d-c890-4887-bd3b-99d1d7dbaab7\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/226ad653-7222-4302-bb3e-1ed350e23c6a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Visit ChartList\r\n2. Verify that \"Dashboards added to\" column is visible and that it correctly displays the dashboards. Dashboard names should be clickable and navigate to given dashboard. Truncated dashboards should appear in a tooltip\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently, in explore & dashboard, we usually apply a row limit\r\non the query we issue against the database.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, some visualization backend code does some\r\npost-processing on data frames using pandas, typically pivoting\r\nsome things, which affects the result set's row count in\r\nintricate capacities.\r\n\r\nNow from a UX standpoint the user is exposed with:\r\n- row limits in the control panels\r\n- row count in various areas of the UI where visualization, preview,\r\n  samples and raw results are shown\r\n\r\nCurrently we show the rowcount that's from row-processing. So maybe\r\na hard limit was applied at 1000 rows on the database, but we\r\npivot and it goes does to say 532, and we show the user that\r\nwe haven't hit the limit when we actually did.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the component that shows rowcount is supposed\r\nto turn red if limit is hit, letting the user know they are looking at\r\ntruncated data.\r\n\r\nThis PR carries the right row count to the `RowCountLabel` above the visualization in explore so that it can turn red if the limit is reached reliably. \r\n\r\nFor now, this PR does not do anything new around the other RowCountLabel located in the `RESULTS` (south) pane.

for https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27470. Specifically this PR ensures we leverage the actual database‚Äîas opposed to a mocked version‚Äîwhen rendering the Jinjarized SQL statements as previously the `filter_value` macro would render as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(<Mock name='mock.get_dialect().statement_compiler()' id='140696575258688'>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe mocked logic was initially necessarily when said logic was planned to be a replacement for the `ParsedQuery` class as opposed to serving as a helper method.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new table called `database_user_oauth2_tokens`. The table is used for storing personal user tokens associated with a given database:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n# \\d database_user_oauth2_tokens\r\n                                               Table \"public.database_user_oauth2_tokens\"\r\n         Column          |            Type             | Collation | Nullable |                         Default\r\n-------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------\r\n created_on              | timestamp without time zone |           |          |\r\n changed_on              | timestamp without time zone |           |          |\r\n id                      | integer                     |           | not null | nextval('database_user_oauth2_tokens_id_seq'::regclass)\r\n user_id                 | integer                     |           | not null |\r\n database_id             | integer                     |           | not null |\r\n access_token            | bytea                       |           |          |\r\n access_token_expiration | timestamp without time zone |           |          |\r\n refresh_token           | bytea                       |           |          |\r\n created_by_fk           | integer                     |           |          |\r\n changed_by_fk           | integer                     |           |          |\r\nIndexes:\r\n    \"database_user_oauth2_tokens_pkey\" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)\r\nForeign-key constraints:\r\n    \"database_user_oauth2_tokens_changed_by_fk_fkey\" FOREIGN KEY (changed_by_fk) REFERENCES ab_user(id)\r\n    \"database_user_oauth2_tokens_created_by_fk_fkey\" FOREIGN KEY (created_by_fk) REFERENCES ab_user(id)\r\n    \"database_user_oauth2_tokens_database_id_fkey\" FOREIGN KEY (database_id) REFERENCES dbs(id)\r\n    \"database_user_oauth2_tokens_user_id_fkey\" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES ab_user(id)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a SQLAlchemy engine is instantiated, the personal user token (or `None`) will be passed to the `get_url_for_impersonation` method in the DB engine spec, so that a custom URL can be built for the user. For example, for GSheets:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_url_for_impersonation(\r\n    cls,\r\n    url: URL,\r\n    impersonate_user: bool,\r\n    username: str | None,\r\n    access_token: str | None,  # <== here\r\n) -> URL:\r\n    if not impersonate_user:\r\n        return url\r\n\r\n    if username is not None:\r\n        user = security_manager.find_user(username=username)\r\n        if user and user.email:\r\n            url = url.update_query_dict({\"subject\": user.email})\r\n\r\n    if access_token:\r\n        url = url.update_query_dict({\"access_token\": access_token})\r\n\r\n    return url\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change allows users to login to databases like BigQuery, Snowflake, Dremio, Databricks, Google Sheets, etc. using their own credentials. This makes it easier to set up databases, since service accounts are no longer required, and provides better isolation of data between users. Only support for Google Sheets is implemented in this PR, and it's considered the reference implementation. Note that a newer version of Shillelagh is required, since a change in the Google Auth API introduced a [regression](https://github.com/betodealmeida/shillelagh/pull/438).\r\n\r\nIn order to populate the table with personal access tokens, the DB engine spec checks for a specific exception that signals that OAuth2 should start:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass BaseEngineSpec:\r\n    def execute(...) -> None:\r\n        try:\r\n            cursor.execute(query)\r\n        except cls.oauth2_exception as ex:  # <== here\r\n            if cls.is_oauth2_enabled() and g.user:\r\n                cls.start_oauth2_dance(database_id)\r\n            raise cls.get_dbapi_mapped_exception(ex) from ex\r\n        except Exception as ex:\r\n            raise cls.get_dbapi_mapped_exception(ex) from ex\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen called, the `start_oauth2_dance` method will return the error `OAUTH2_REDIRECT` to the frontend. The error is captured by the `ErrorMessageWithStackTrace` component, which provides a link to the user so they can start the OAuth2 authentication. Since this is implemented at the DB engine spec level, any query will trigger it ‚Äî in SQL Lab, Explore, or dashboards ‚Äî see the screenshots below for the UX.\r\n\r\nNote that while the current implementation triggers OAuth2 when a query needs authorization, we could also implement affordances in the database UI to manually trigger OAuth2 to store the personal access tokens. This could be done in the future.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nSQL Lab. Note that the query runs automatically once OAuth is completed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/1c328d8e-e2ad-48d9-8c82-b04279d93dad\r\n\r\nExplore. Note that the chart is automatically updated after OAuth:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/e9b787f0-34fd-40c1-b700-0c6f49b5fdd9\r\n\r\nSame thing for dashboards:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/8ab5dd51-9bea-437f-b22d-f68364b72308\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create a Google Sheets database.\r\n2. Create a Google OAuth2 application at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/ of type \"Web application\"\r\n3. Edit `superset_config.py` and add the client ID and secret:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nDATABASE_OAUTH2_CREDENTIALS = {\r\n    \"Google Sheets\": {\r\n       \"CLIENT_ID\": \"XXX.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\r\n       \"CLIENT_SECRET\": \"GOCSPX-YYY\",\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. In SQL Lab, try to query a sheet that is not shared publicly. It should trigger OAuth2.\r\n5. Add the sheet as a dataset and create a chart.\r\n6. Delete the tokens from the database:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDELETE FROM database_user_oauth2_tokens;\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Reload the chart. It should trigger OAuth2.\r\n8. Add the chart to a dashboard, delete the tokens, and reload the dashboard. It should trigger OAuth2.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has

SUMMARY\r\nAt Airbnb, we have a dataset that contains > 10k columns and metrics.\r\nGiven the size of this dataset, the current rendering of the show all datasource target list is not

you use the sort by from chart editor control panel it has no effect , the Sort by control attatches an order by to the sql query which actually sorts the data on sql level but not in chart editor . You can see that it gives proper sorted data in sql lab.\r\nThe reason for this is that  the post processing applied on the dataframe causes it to lose the sorting applied by the order by query. \r\n<img width=\"1496\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-23 at 3 13 24‚ÄØPM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70762780/a028afba-6fb3-4d1b-9a80-d6f44fddafa4\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-23 at 3 13 52‚ÄØPM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70762780/67169380-bf5c-4620-b67e-6287cba56643\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSolution : What we basically do is we preserve the order of the dataframe with respect to X axis and we store it in a variable and then re use that variable to re order the dataframe again \r\n\r\nExample : \r\n\r\nIn the above screenshots we can see that the output data comes in order \"No : Not Willing To \" , \"Yes willing to\" , \"No answer\" in sql lab if sorted correctly , what we can do is that we can preserve this order in an array as [ \"No : Not Willing To \" , \"Yes willing to\" , \"No answer\"] and we will later use this order to reorder the data after postprocessing so that the data gets correct soring order \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: \r\n![screen-capture (11)](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70762780/b24b6fc2-a600-40bd-82e1-e180d244ca46)\r\nAfter: \r\n![screen-capture (12)](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70762780/e86a099a-3854-4dc8-810e-7166058e6d28)\r\n\r\nWith this fix , can apply sorting on any column available in the dataset, for example we apply sorting by Max(Age), a column which is not applied in the present chart , currently the x axis sort by only allows the applied metrics or columns.. with this fix we can use any column in the dataset\r\n\r\n![screen-capture (14)](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70762780/b6efa30e-3c87-45ed-bc25-f53dcc01a15e)\r\n\r\nOr can write extreme edge cases where the user can write custom sql for ordering data , this is actually the use case in some organisations where the data needs to be sorted in specific order that makes no sense by metric or category name , so currently they make dummy columns and assign them numbers .. this whole process can be avoided if sorting with custom sql can be done :\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-22 at 6 23 20‚ÄØPM (2)](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70762780/35adbfea-47e7-4332-abb9-c0dc98b7a9ce)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-22 at 6 23 37‚ÄØPM (1)](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70762780/891e8ccb-0944-41aa-9cdc-91264b328131)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTry using Sort By on a chart on Superset 4.0 by any metric and check if the data gets sorted or not, if necessary compare it with sql lab results as it shows the correct order\r\n\r\nThen try using sort by ,in chart editor in this fix & try sorting by any metric and compare it with the sql lab results\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n`supersetbot` was designed to support CI workflow, and we've been doing this by doing a quick `npm install supersetbot` which downloads and uses the latest **published** version. But now, instead of using this approach, I'd like to install the local one instead from the repo using `npm link` so that PRs that need to touch it are always consistent with the version needed.\r\n\r\nThis came up as there's an open PR upgrading python to 3.10 globally in repo, but upgrading supersetbot didn't take effect as expected.\r\n\r\nAbout the code, note that using a local reusable GHA requires running a checkout, which is pretty cheap so I think it's ok","created_at":"2024-03-22T01:03:37Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:49:35Z","closed_at":"2024-03-25T15:58:22Z","merged_at":"2024-03-25T15:58:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"33c2d98e665d1031fd6db925fb83b596473e7387","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI'm unclear on why exactly CI succeeded while this was an issue running\r\nlocally. I'm guessing it has to do with `--mount` and how it works\r\naround caching, so I'm moving to a COPY-based approach, which is more\r\nstandard and easy to reason about. It also leaves a useful artefact on\r\nthe machine as to how it was built. It does add a tiny layer and payload\r\non the image, but it's super cheap for the utility/introspection it provides.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/27606\r\n\r\n----\r\nI found the issue as to why this defect in the dockerfile wasn't caught in CI, it's because the `--preset dev` parameter was not getting passed down properly, and resulting in targeting the `lean` layer, avoid that issue altogether. I fixed `supersetbot`, added unit tests and published a new version on npm.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING/VALIDATION\r\n\r\ntested `docker-compose up` and validated that CI is now building the right target as opposed to always be building the `lean` target.","created_at":"2024-03-21T17:25:51Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:50:03Z","closed_at":"2024-03-21T19:22:57Z","merged_at":"2024-03-21T19:22:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"6f3afab01d94694f4b014337ec6fb0a13786ce55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","

SUMMARY\r\nWe are adding the implementation and usage of the AWS S3 upload feature in Apache Superset. This feature allows users to send reports directly to an AWS S3 bucket, and is configured to be an additional delivery option (like email & slack).\r\n\r\nWhen writing files to S3 buckets, there are three methods available for authentication:\r\n1. Taking credentials from the user in the frontend (via a modal) per report\r\n2. Taking credentials from the superset_config.py file\r\n3. Utilizing an AWS IAM role associated with the ECS/EC2 role\r\n\r\nMethods 1 & 2 require an AWS IAM User, while method 3 makes use of the executing IAM Role for the running system.\r\n\r\n# TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n## Installation and Setup\r\n### Pre-requisites\r\n* Ensure Superset is installed and running.\r\n* Create an AWS IAM User and an access key / secret key for that user.\r\n* Create an S3 bucket with a bucket policy that grants access to the user above, and an aws role of your choice.\r\n\r\n### Configuration of feature\r\n##### Enable the feature\r\nUser should update the superset_config.py (docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config.py) file with following:\r\n\r\nEnsure that the reports feature is enabled, and enable the feature with the `FEATURE_FLAGS` in superset_config.py.\r\n```\r\nFEATURE_FLAGS[\"ALERT_REPORTS\"] = True\r\nFEATURE_FLAGS[\"ENABLE_AWS\"] = True\r\nALERT_REPORTS_NOTIFICATION_DRY_RUN = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: If the User doesn‚Äôt enable the feature flag of ENABLE_AWS, but has ALERT_REPORTS set to True then alerts & reports will still work as per normal (Email & Slack delivery options). The AWS S3 option will be unavailable.\r\n\r\nOnce enabled, when creating a report, the user will be able to deploy the result to an S3 bucket. They will be able to specify where/how the file should be written through the web interface.\r\n\r\n![delivery_options](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90489859/fcc3d53a-0107-473f-99f0-ed7e0b14ea17)\r\n![authorization_methods](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90489859/b3910b57-99a2-4232-bc89-9aab981f90c3)\r\n\r\n##### Method 1: Frontend User Credentials\r\nUsing this method allows each report to be delivered to different buckets, and to use a different set of credentials. In our use case, this was important as we may be delivering reports directly to different customer S3 buckets.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing the feature in the frontend, users will be prompted to enter their AWS credentials through the existing modal. Users can provide their IAM User's Access Key and the Secret Access Key into the user interface itself. When generating the report, these values will be used to write the file to S3.\r\n\r\n![input_credentials](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90489859/be9591ac-e7ff-4b26-8d70-7971773adb39)\r\n\r\n##### Method 2: Taking credentials from the superset_config.py file\r\nThe report may instead be configured to use a default set of credentials as specified in the config file. This use case allows for a more streamlined method for sending reports, always using the same credentials. This can be used primarily when a company is delivering reports to their own S3 bucket, and could be done with an on-premise setup.\r\n\r\nAdd the following code in superset_config.py.\r\n```\r\n# AWS Credentials\r\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY = '####'\r\nAWS_SECRET_KEY = '####'\r\n```\r\n\r\n![config_credentials](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90489859/8c66628d-483c-4030-80cb-dd94cbf49d49)\r\n\r\n##### Method 3: AWS IAM Role\r\nFinally, the report may instead be configured to use the running system's IAM role. This use case follows AWS best practices in granting access to a resource through a role instead of directly through a user. Similar to method 2, this method will always use the same credentials - but this is no longer changeable through the config file. Although this method would most commonly be used by services running in AWS (EC2 or ECS), it could also be run by properly configuring the AWS CLI (which I will not get into here).\r\n\r\n![role_credentials](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90489859/3c6296e8-da98-4d5b-b022-70968810d2ab)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nOnce setup has been done, the AWS S3 option can be used for sending reports/alert directly to the S3 bucket from either the settings menu, or when editing a dashboard or chart.\r\n\r\n#### Navigate to settings, then on Alerts & Reports.\r\nWhen creating a report directly, one can choose to deploy the report to an S3 bucket, and may also choose which authentication method they would like to use when delivering the report.\r\n* Create a new report\r\n* In the Notification Method select S3.\r\n* Then select one of the available S3 method options: AWS_S3_credentials, AWS_S3_pyconfig, or AWS_S3_IAM.\r\n* Provide the bucket name to which the report will be delivered.\r\n* if using AWS_S3_credentials, then fill in the required aws credentials.\r\n\r\n![list](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90489859/427c324c-149d-40ca-9be6-a04bcce73dfd)\r\n\r\n#### From the dashboard / chart\r\nAll three S3 method options are available when viewing a dashboard or chart page.\r\n* Create a new dashboard or chart, or view an existing one\r\n* Using the dashboard or chart's menu, select Set up a S3 report and use any of the S3 method options available.\r\n* Observe that the dashboard or chart's report can be seen in the Alerts & Reports page.\r\n\r\n![start_from_chart](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90489859/12ab9b45-2ec8-43d4-9ac0-4102ad0e2fd1)\r\n![modal_from_chart](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90489859/4791c361-e45e-48b5-8ca7-12a34fd42521)\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new Jinja macro: ``{{ metric('metric_key', dataset_id) }}``. This macro can be used to retrieve metric syntax from a dataset, to be re-used in charts/SQL Lab/etc.\r\n\r\nThis is useful to avoid copy/paste and provide a centralized place for metric management. Some use-cases:\r\n* **Overwriting a metric label in the chart level:** Users can use the macro as a custom SQL metric to define a different label in the chart without changing the dataset configuration.\r\n* **Combining metrics:** Users could combine metrics (for example `{{ metric('revenue') }} - {{ metric('cost') }}`.\r\n* **Using metrics in SQL Lab:** Retrieve the metric syntax in SQL Lab for ad-hoc querying.\r\n* **Reusing metrics across datasets:** When creating virtual datasets that are \"variations\" of a curated physical dataset, this macro can help retrieving metric syntax syntax from the curated dataset into the virtual one.\r\n\r\nThe `dataset_id` parameter is optional and if not provided Superset will attempt to get it from the current context.\r\n\r\nI also noticed there were both `test_jinja_context.py` and `jinja_context_test.py`, so I unified the two.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n[Video attached to Google Drive (Exceeds 10MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14yqTiyUABAXWp2kQGZByGN3nV_89tMjT/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nBoth unit and integration tests added. For manual testing:\r\n\r\n1. Create a metric in any dataset.\r\n2. Create a chart using this dataset.\r\n3. Define a metric using custom SQL: `{{ metric(\"metric_key\") }}`, replacing `metric_key` with the key used to create the metric in step 1.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\n[By design](https://cratedb.com/docs/crate/reference/en/5.6/general/ddl/data-types.html#timestamp), when CrateDB casts `BIGINT` values to `TIMESTAMP` it interprets them as being in milliseconds but when it casts `DOUBLE` values it interprets them as being in seconds.\r\nThis means that when Superset was trying to filter on a value such as 1679184000000.0 this was interpreted as a date far in the future instead of 2024.\r\n\r\nFixes #27382\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n- Spin up a CrateDB instance\r\n- Create a table with a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` column\r\n- Spin up Superset with `docker-compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up`\r\n- Browse http://localhost:8088/ and login with admin / admin\r\n- Create a database connection from Superset to CrateDB using `crate://username:password@hostname:4200/?ssl=true`\r\n- Create a dataset pointing to the table created earlier\r\n- Create a new table chart\r\n- Define dimensions and metrics\r\n- Add a filter on the timestamp column for last week or a custom interval of dates\r\n- Check in CrateDB the query that was run with `SELECT * FROM sys.jobs_log ORDER BY started DESC;`\r\n- Edit `/app/superset/db_engine_specs/crate.py` as in this PR\r\n- Restart the `superset_app` container\r\n- Try again creating the chart with the timestamp filter\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---
