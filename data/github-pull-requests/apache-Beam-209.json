implements a state request handler for batch side inputs in the portable Flink runner. The core implementation is the same as in the non-portable runner: PCollections used as side inputs are materialized as (in-memory) broadcast variables. These materialized elements are then exposed by a side input state handler.\r\n\r\nNote that we construct a duplicate `ExecutableProcessBundleDescriptor` here rather than use an `ExecutableStage`. This is because the latter exposes side input details (most importantly coder structure) that are not available in `ExecutableStage`. It would be cleaner to migrate side input utilities from executable bundle descriptors directly to `ExecutableStage`, but that refactor should be done in a separate change.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

is a direct move of the code from `build_rules.gradle` to a binary plugin in the `buildSrc` directory. A proxy `build_rules.gradle` is left in place, but should be migrated away from on a module-by-module basis.\r\n\r\nI deliberately did not do anything to refactor the logic. Making this a plugin might make it more natural to do refactors later. Personally, I think each \"nature\" is probably a natural choice for a separate plugin, and it should be very straightforward to do that.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All I did was ensure that `./gradlew build` ran. There are some failures (prior description underestimated them due to masking). I didn't yet run the publishing bits that are hidden behind conditionals. Those likely still need some `project.` added, etc. Just putting this up for early review.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

What?\r\nSupport unbounded limit in Beam SQL shell. In the past, due to default global window and default trigger, queries like \"SELECT col_name FROM unbounded_table LIMIT 1\" will not return in SQL Shell.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to support unbounded limit by starting a daemon thread to monitoring return value collection in BeanEnumerableConverter, and stopping pipeline when collected values reach limit count. More detailed description can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13zeTewHH9nfwhSlcE4x77WQwr1U2Z4sTiNRjOXUj2aw/edit?usp=sharing.\r\n\r\n##### Testing\r\n - [x] Unit test.\r\n \r\nAdding two unit tests to mock bounded and unbounded input tables to test LIMIT functionality.\r\n\r\n - [x] Integration test.\r\n\r\nAdding one e2e integration test, which utilizes Google Cloud Pub/Sub to test the unbounded limit on auto-generated Pub/Sub messages.\r\n\r\n - [x] Other test.\r\n\r\nManually tested unbounded limit in Beam SQL shell on a Google Cloud Pub/Sub table.
