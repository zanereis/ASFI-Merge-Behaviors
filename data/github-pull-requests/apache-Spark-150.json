What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `RocksDB` backend in Spark History Server via a new configuration,\r\n`spark.history.store.hybridStore.diskBackend`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark History Server's `HybridStore` uses `LevelDB` which is not working on Java 17 native Apple Silicon VM.\r\n`RocksDB` will support Java 17 native Apple Silicon VM in Apache Spark 3.3 timeframe.\r\n\r\n- `spark.history.store.hybridStore.diskBackend=leveldb`

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to set  `outputEncoder` to `None` for `ScalaUDF.preCanonicalized`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe once did the same thing to `inputEncoders` in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29106 to fix a bug where the canonicalized ScalaUDFs for the same ScalaUDF becomes different after resolving `inputEncoders`.  So this PR applies the same fix to `outputEncoder` to avoid hitting the same issue in the future. Note that we don't have the issue caused by `outputEncoder` now since we don't resolve `outputEncoder` yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen push-based shuffle enabled, reduce task will ask ESS for MergedMetas, then `PushMergedRemoteMetaFailedFetchResult` should be returned instead of `PushMergedRemoteMetaFetchResult` if there is no available push-merged block on ESS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause that push-based shuffle works as best-effort, there are opportunities that no chunks of the block are available on ESS, in current implementation, it will cause reduce task failed with `ArithmeticException: / by zero`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.storage.PushBasedFetchHelper.createChunkBlockInfosFromMetaResponse(PushBasedFetchHelper.scala:117)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.next(ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.scala:980)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.next(ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.scala:84)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.CompletionIterator.next(CompletionIterator.scala:29)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the change, a `PushMergedRemoteMetaFetchResult` will let reduce task fall back to fetching the original blocks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it'a bug fix. The change makes push-based shuffle stable. Before this change, my 1T TPCDS test failed several times w/ `ArithmeticException: / by zero`, after the change, passed w/o any exception.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, and run 1T TPCDS manually.","created_at":"2021-12-17T10:23:20Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T00:18:22Z","closed_at":"2022-05-04T00:18:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a572d59a09fda00a5058f7dfe47efe32700b2c0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34934/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34934/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34934/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82da1c2d8ed25996b898a990a7dcd2ec87cfc9d1","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-37675","ref":"SPARK-37675","sha":"82da1c2d8ed25996b898a990a7dcd2ec87cfc9d1","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReduce the output partition of output stage to avoid producing small files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe partition size of the finalStage with `DataWritingCommand` or `V2TableWriteExec`  may use the `ADVISORY_PARTITION_SIZE_IN_BYTES` which is smaller one, and  may produce some small files, it is bad for production.\r\n\r\nSometime, we may adjust `ADVISORY_PARTITION_SIZE_IN_BYTES` to a big one to avoid above , but it is NOT a good idea, it may take effect other Jobs or stages to  coalesce small shuffle partitions or split skewed shuffle partition.\r\n\r\nSo we should introduce a new partition size instead of  `ADVISORY_PARTITION_SIZE_IN_BYTES`  for  the finalStage with `DataWritingCommand` or `V2TableWriteExec`  to avoid small files.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unittests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-17T08:54:18Z","updated_at":"2022-06-12T00:21:16Z","closed_at":"2022-06-12T00:21:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89919678bd13928bed96a787dddf450c8415344b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34933/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34933/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34933/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0dfd7043bf17b21449de080159989412fba9970c","head":{"label":"weixiuli:SPARK-37674","ref":"SPARK-37674","sha":"0dfd7043bf17b21449de080159989412fba9970c","user":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140506691,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA1MDY2OTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"weixiuli/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli/spark","description":"Mirror

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds predicate push-down and column pruning to CTEs that are not inlined as well as fixes a few potential correctness issues:\r\n  1) Replace (previously not inlined) CTE refs with Repartition operations at the end of logical plan optimization so that WithCTE is not carried over to physical plan. As a result, we can simplify the logic of physical planning, as well as avoid a correctness issue where the logical link of a physical plan node can point to `WithCTE` and lead to unexpected behaviors in AQE, e.g., class cast exceptions in DPP.\r\n  2) Pull (not inlined) CTE defs from subqueries up to the main query level, in order to avoid creating copies of the same CTE def during predicate push-downs and other transformations.\r\n  3) Make CTE IDs more deterministic by starting from 0 for each query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImprove de-duped CTEs' performance with predicate pushdown and column pruning; fixes de-duped CTEs' correctness issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes replacing currently used `Protocols`:\r\n\r\n- `PandasDataFrameLike`\r\n- `PandasSeriesLike`\r\n\r\nwith simple aliases of upstream types.\r\n\r\nThis exposed a number of typing issues, pirmairly around `pyspark.pandas` API, which will be resolved in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally it adds [VirtusLab/pandas-stubs](https://github.com/VirtusLab/pandas-stubs) to CI dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently used `Protocols` where a workaround, included to improve typing coverage until Pandas exposes their type hints.\r\n\r\nIn a meantime, relatively stable stubs sources emerged (with a lot of ongoing discussions around) and `pandas-stubs` package (available on PyPI and conda-forge) provides better coverage without adding maintenance overhead on our side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBetter typing experience around Pandas UDFs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting typecheck pipeline and unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the `GCM` mode ([Galois/Counter Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)) as the default in the AES functions `aes_encrypt()` and `aes_decrypt()`. Also I modified AES tests for the `ECB` mode by specifying the mode explicitly, and expression examples (AesEncrypt was excluded from checks because `GCM` includes random vectors in its results, and expression examples became unstable).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent mode `ECB` is not semantically secure, see [Why shouldn't I use ECB encryption?](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/20941/why-shouldnt-i-use-ecb-encryption)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Since the `aes_encrypt()`/`aes_decrypt()` functions haven't been released yet, we can change the default mode to more secure one `GCM`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the support for extending user feature steps with configuration.\r\n\r\nBefore this patch user can only add feature step

KubernetesFeatureConfigStep`\r\n- `class TestStepWithK8SConf(conf: KubernetesConf) extends KubernetesFeatureConfigStep`\r\n- `class TestStepWithDriverConf(conf: KubernetesDriverConf) extends

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30206 , a developer API for custom feature steps has been added, but it didn't support initialize user feature step with kubernetes conf (like `KubernetesConf`/`KubernetesDriverConf`/`KubernetesExecutorConf`).\r\n\r\nIn most of scenarios, users want to make corresponding changes in their feature steps according to the configuration. Such as, the customized scheduler scenario, user wants to configure pod according to passed job configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nImprove the developer API

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds 3 new syntactic sugar overloads to Dataset's join method as proposed in [SPARK-35739](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35739).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImproved development experience for developers using Spark SQL, specifically when coding in Java.  \r\n\r\nPrior to changes the Seq overloads required developers to use less-known Java-to-Scala converter methods that made code less readable.  The overloads internalize those converter calls for two of the new methods and the third method adds a single-item overload that is useful for both Java and Scala.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the three new overloads technically constitute an API change to the Dataset class.  These overloads are net-new and have been commented appropriately in line with the existing methods.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest cases were not added because it is unclear to me where/how syntactic sugar overloads fit into the testing suites (if at all).  Happy to add them if I can be pointed in the correct direction.\r\n\r\n* Changes were tested in Scala via spark-shell.\r\n* Changes were tested in Java by modifying an example:\r\n  ```\r\n  diff

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark supports push down limit to data source.\r\nHowever, in the user's scenario, limit must have the premise of order by. Because limit and order by are more valuable together.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, push down top N(same as order by ... limit N) outputs the data with basic order to Spark sort, the the sort of Spark may have some performance improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. push down top N is very useful for users scenario.\r\n2. push down top N could improves the performance of sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'. Just change the physical execute.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip PIP packaging test in Jenkins. We're already running it in GitHub Actions, and Jenkins is expected to be dropped soon this month.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nWriting pyspark-3.3.0.dev0/setup.cfg\r\nCreating tar archive\r\nremoving 'pyspark-3.3.0.dev0' (and everything under it)\r\nInstalling dist into virtual env\r\nObtaining file:///home/jenkins/workspace/SparkPullRequestBuilder%402/python\r\npyspark requires Python '>=3.7' but the running Python is 3.6.8\r\nCleaning up temporary directory - /tmp/tmp.CCragmNU1X\r\n[error] running /home/jenkins/workspace/SparkPullRequestBuilder@2/dev/run-pip-tests ; received return code 1\r\nAttempting to post to GitHub...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter we drop Python 3.6 at SPARK-37632, PIP packaging test fails intermittently https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/146255/console. Apparently, different Python versions are installed in some of Jenkins machines. We should skip the test in these cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins build in this PR would test it out.","created_at":"2021-12-16T04:02:28Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:51:44Z","closed_at":"2021-12-16T06:23:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d1d1ce6da7156d4e39be39501c1672d4cf63931","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34917/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34917/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34917/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3d85faa25c0a740ad95424a5115a006d9d653734","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-37658","ref":"SPARK-37658","sha":"3d85faa25c0a740ad95424a5115a006d9d653734","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Currently only a single bucket column is supported in `BucketTransform`, fix the code to make multiple bucket columns work.\r\n2. Separate `SortedBucketTransform` from `BucketTransform`, and make the `arguments` in `SortedBucketTransform` in the format of `columns numBuckets sortedColumns` so we have a way to find out the `columns` and `sortedColumns`.\r\n3. add more test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix bugs in `BucketTransform` and `SortedBucketTransform`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `RocksDB` implementation for `KVStore` which is a clone of `LevelDB` implementation.\r\nIn the future, we can have a `LevelDB`-free Apache Spark distribution. \r\nPlease note that this PR intentionally add `RocksDB`-only code and avoid LevelDB-related code changes (like refactoring).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 2.3.0 (SPARK-20641) in 2017, we have `LevelDB` implementation for `KVStore` interface.\r\nCurrently, `LevelDB` JNI library became inactive and blocks Apple Silicon support.\r\nInstead, `RocksDB` community is actively working on Apple Silicon at https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/7720 .\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is used in Spark internal.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark seems to be not supported yet in our GitHub Action Benchmark job.\r\nI attached the performance comparison on `MacBook Pro (15-inch 2019, 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7)`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nProductName:\tmacOS\r\nProductVersion:\t12.0.1\r\nBuildVersion:\t21A559\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.spark.util.kvstore.LevelDBBenchmark\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to use an existing active Spark session instead of `SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate` in all places of pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\n`SparkSession._getActiveSessionOrCreate()` is introduced as a helper method.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/988381b48ff188fba52c01899f99140fab5b816b.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome places in pandas API on Spark shows warnings for configurations not taking effect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. No warnings (for configurations not taking effect) are shown now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests.","created_at":"2021-12-15T06:48:16Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T04:28:08Z","closed_at":"2021-12-16T04:11:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d02ef14b63aebe43e322fb33ba89a92e774b04c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently , Spark supports push down aggregate with partial-agg and final-agg . For some data source (e.g. JDBC ) , we can avoid partial-agg and final-agg by running completely on database.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove performance for aggregate pushdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'. Just change the inner implement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt's currently possible to set sensible site-wide spark configuration defaults by using `$SPARK_CONF_DIR/spark-env.sh`. In the case where a user is using pyspark, however, there are a number of things that aren't discoverable by that script, due to the way that it's called. There is a chain of calls (java_gateway.py -> shell script -> java -> shell script) that ends up obliterating any bit of the python context.\r\n\r\nThis change proposes to add en environment variable `_PYSPARK_DRIVER_SYS_EXECUTABLE` which points to the filename of the top-level python executable within pyspark's `java_gateway.py` bootstrapping process. With that, spark-env.sh will be able to infer enough information about the python environment to set the appropriate configuration variables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRight now, there a number of config options useful to pyspark that can't be reliably set by `spark-env.sh` because it is unaware of the python context that spawning the executor. To give the most trivial example, it is currently possible to set `spark.kubernetes.container.image` or `spark.driver.host` based on information readily available from the environment (e.g. the k8s downward API). However, `spark.pyspark.python` and family cannot be set because when `spark-env.sh` executes it's lost all of the python context. We can instruct users to add the appropriate config variables, but this form of cargo-culting is error-prone and not scalable. It would be much better to expose important python variables so that pyspark can not be a second-class citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. With this change, if python spawns the JVM, `spark-env.sh` will receive an environment variable `_PYSPARK_DRIVER_SYS_EXECUTABLE` pointing to the python executor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTo be perfectly honest, I don't know where this fits into the testing infrastructure. I monkey-patched a binary 3.2.0 install to add the lines to java_gateway.py and that works, but in terms of adding this to the CI ... I'm at a loss. I'm more than willing to add the additional info, if needed.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-15T00:43:33Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T08:58:30Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T00:32:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53a3aa4189ec6f936382c170979c306955af49bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e747a2f99b2b6e2ab0d8e93ce26d7a8f32ebeb81","head":{"label":"PerilousApricot:feature/python-venv-hook","ref":"feature/python-venv-hook","sha":"e747a2f99b2b6e2ab0d8e93ce26d7a8f32ebeb81","user":{"login":"PerilousApricot","id":93354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot","html_url":"https://github.com/PerilousApricot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":254262187,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTQyNjIxODc=","name":"spark","full_name":"PerilousApricot/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PerilousApricot","id":93354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot","html_url":"https://github.com/PerilousApricot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PerilousApricot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PerilousApricot/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to switch default index to `distributed-sequence` by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`sequence` type relies on sending all data to one executor that easily causes OOM and make the computation slow\r\nWe should better switch to `distributed-sequence` type that truly distributes the data.\r\n\r\nIn my own internal benchmark, it boosts the performance around 2 ~ 3 times faster on average.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIdeally no. Order might be affected but that's not already guaranteed. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting CI should test it out.","created_at":"2021-12-15T00:33:18Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T01:18:53Z","closed_at":"2021-12-15T02:15:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b153b4561b739cb01119f6a40e28f503cbf30389","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/969911a816d99b527b60a27c05254f30231212d2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-37649","ref":"SPARK-37649","sha":"969911a816d99b527b60a27c05254f30231212d2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to migrate from log4j1 to log4j2 in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nApache Spark uses log4j 1.x, so hence is not susceptible to the recent log4j v2 vulnerability. However, log4j 1.x has reached end of life and is no longer supported. Vulnerabilities reported after August 2015 against log4j 1.x were not checked and will not be fixed. As a result, we are recommended to upgrade Spark to Log4j 2 as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Users may need to rewrite their log4j properties file for log4j2. As of version 2.4, log4j now supports configuration via properties files. Note that the property syntax is not the same as the syntax used in log4j 1, but during the migration I found the syntax is pretty close so the migration should be straightforward.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPassed all existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use an existing active Spark session instead of `SparkSession.getOrCreate` in pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause it shows warnings for configurations not taking effect as below:\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it attempts to create a new session, and shows warnings as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> ps.range(10)\r\n21/12/14 16:12:58 WARN SparkSession: Using an existing SparkSession; the static sql configurations will not take effect.\r\n21/12/14 16:12:58 WARN

introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, after this PR, it will explicitly uses active Spark session, and does not show such warnings:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> ps.range(10)\r\n...\r\n   id\r\n0   0\r\n1   1\r\n2   2\r\n3   3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pyspark.pandas as

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to use V2 commands as default as outlined in [SPARK-36588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36588), and this PR migrates `ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET PROPERTIES` to use v2 command by default.\r\n\r\nNote that the work to tests covering both v1/v2 were done in #34842.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands,  and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-29295 introduces a mechanism that writes to external tables is a dynamic partition method, and the data in the target partition will be deleted first.\r\n\r\nAssuming that 1001 partitions are written, the data of 10001 partitions will be deleted first, but because `hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions` is 1000 by default, loadDynamicPartitions will fail at this time, but the data of 1001 partitions has been deleted.\r\n\r\nSo we can check whether the number of dynamic partitions is greater than `hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions` before deleting, it should fail quickly at this time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid data that cannot be recovered when the job fails.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug in nested column pruning for Generate. The bug happens after we replace extractor's reference attribute with generator's input, then when we try to replace a top extractor (e.g. `GetStructField`), if the replaced child expression is array type, `extractFieldName` will fail by throwing `ClassCastException`.\r\n\r\nThis is the backport from #34845 to branch-3.2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n In particular, when we transform the extractor and replace with generator's input, we cannot simply do a transform up because because if we replace the attribute, `extractFieldName` could cause `ClassCastException` error. We need to get the field name before replacing down the attribute/other extractor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-13T23:07:33Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:25:30Z","closed_at":"2021-12-14T04:24:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2928b9ddbfc7ae0abd4865f3bef9b9da03d1f3de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/574f749ba06dbba0c37ecb565b81e9907733a30f","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-37577-3.2","ref":"SPARK-37577-3.2","sha":"574f749ba06dbba0c37ecb565b81e9907733a30f","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThere is some similar logic in promoting string to double type in `TypeCoercion` and `AnsiTypeCoercion`.\r\n\r\nWe can change the function `Abs`/`UnaryMinus`/`UnaryPositive` to extend `ImplicitCastInputTypes` so that string will implicitly cast to Double type in the rule `ImplicitTypeCasts`.  We don't have to repeat the logic in rule `PromoteStrings` or `PromoteStringLiterals`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimplify type coercion implementation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, only string type can implicitly cast to numeric types in default/Ansi mode, so there are no behavior changes after code changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass SQLQueryTestSuite especially

To understand this performance issue, let's take a closer look at the related source code. First of all, `Expression.canonicalized` is recursive, as its default implementation is\r\n```\r\nlazy val canonicalized: Expression = {\r\n  val canonicalizedChildren = children.map(_.canonicalized)\r\n  Canonicalize.execute(withNewChildren(canonicalizedChildren))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever,  `Canonicalize.execute` is also recursive when dealing with commutative operators, as it needs to collect all the commutative operators in the expression tree, and reorder them.\r\n\r\nLet's say that we have a deep expression tree with 1000 `And`: `And(c1, And(c2, And(c3, ...)))`. If we call its `canonicalized` method, we first reorder 2 `And`s in a small subtree, then reorder 3 `And`s in a larger subtree, ... and finally reorder 1000 `And`s in the complete tree. This is O(n^2).\r\n\r\nTo make it O(n), this PR makes the following changes:\r\n1. Introduce `Expression.roughlyCanonicalized`, which recursively canonicalize each expression node in the tree, without changing the tree structure (thus no commutative operators reordering).\r\n2. `Expression.canonicalized` just reorders the commutative operators in `roughlyCanonicalized`.\r\n3. `Canonicalize` only reorders commutative operators now. Other logics are moved to the corresponding expressions' `roughlyCanonicalized` override.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, when we canonicalize a deep expression tree with 1000 `And`, we first traverse the expression tree once, to make it roughly canonicailized (name, nullability, etc. are normalized). Then we call `Canonicalize` once to reorder `And`s, which also traverse the tree only once.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR upgrades Netty from 4.1.68 to 4.1.71.\r\n\r\nAll the changes from 4.1.68 to 4.1.71 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- 4.1.69: https://netty.io/news/2021/10/11/4-1-69-Final.html\r\n- 4.1.70: https://netty.io/news/2021/10/11/4-1-70-Final.html\r\n- 4.1.71: https://netty.io/news/2021/12/09/4-1-71-Final.html\r\n- 4.1.72: https://netty.io/news/2021/12/13/4-1-72-Final.html\r\n\r\nAnd after [Netty#11732](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11732),  netty-all replaces a fat jar with separate modules, so this pr manually excludes some Netty sub-modules that Spark does not rely on.\r\n\r\nAfter this pr, Spark will rely on the following Netty sub modules:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnetty-all/4.1.72.Final//netty-all-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-buffer/4.1.72.Final//netty-buffer-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-codec/4.1.72.Final//netty-codec-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-common/4.1.72.Final//netty-common-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-handler/4.1.72.Final//netty-handler-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-resolver/4.1.72.Final//netty-resolver-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-tcnative-classes/2.0.46.Final//netty-tcnative-classes-2.0.46.Final.jar\r\nnetty-transport-classes-epoll/4.1.72.Final//netty-transport-classes-epoll-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-transport-classes-kqueue/4.1.72.Final//netty-transport-classes-kqueue-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-transport-native-epoll/4.1.72.Final/linux-aarch_64/netty-transport-native-epoll-4.1.72.Final-linux-aarch_64.jar\r\nnetty-transport-native-epoll/4.1.72.Final/linux-x86_64/netty-transport-native-epoll-4.1.72.Final-linux-x86_64.jar\r\nnetty-transport-native-kqueue/4.1.72.Final/osx-aarch_64/netty-transport-native-kqueue-4.1.72.Final-osx-aarch_64.jar\r\nnetty-transport-native-kqueue/4.1.72.Final/osx-x86_64/netty-transport-native-kqueue-4.1.72.Final-osx-x86_64.jar\r\nnetty-transport-native-unix-common/4.1.72.Final//netty-transport-native-unix-common-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\nnetty-transport/4.1.72.Final//netty-transport-4.1.72.Final.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nand

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support K8s executor rolling policies via `spark.kubernetes.executor.rollPolicy`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsers can choose one of the following policy in order to decommission one executor at every `spark.kubernetes.executor.rollInterval`.\r\n- ID: An executor with the smallest executor ID. This is most human-readable.\r\n- ADD_TIME: An executor with the smallest add-time. This is the most long-live executor.\r\n- TOTAL_GC_TIME: An executor with the biggest GC time. This could have GC issue for some reason.\r\n- TOTAL_DURATION: An executor with the biggest total task time. This executor may have busy neighbor or CPU thresholding by K8s controller.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but this is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n Introduce a rule to handle pushing down a dynamic partition pruning from a child join to its parent join, when the following conditions are met:\r\n (1) the pruning side of the parent join is a partition table\r\n (2) the table to prune is filterable by the JOIN key\r\n (3) the parent join operation is one of the following types: INNER, LEFT SEMI,\r\n  LEFT OUTER (partitioned on right), or RIGHT OUTER (partitioned on left)\r\n \r\nA query example: \r\n```sql\r\nSELECT f.store_id, k.units_sold\r\nFROM fact_stats f\r\nJOIN dim_stats d\r\n    ON f.store_id = d.store_id\r\n        AND d.country = 'NL'\r\nLEFT JOIN fact_sk k\r\n    ON f.store_id = k.store_id\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the PR:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39684231/145710866-70b44119-12ba-4afc-8a02-385189712950.png)\r\n\r\nAfter the PR:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39684231/145710859-93ed90ae-1b5b-4516-a780-dfb1c14e5e0d.png)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPush down a dynamic partition pruning from one join to other joins to prune the table of other joins  to improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unittests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-12T11:53:57Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T00:19:30Z","closed_at":"2022-03-29T00:19:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7189303d3a8e1a97d12a4194389eda2a55845ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34871/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34871/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34871/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a99d47e055b32eaa3f04af7e6ff57957019f9f4d","head":{"label":"weixiuli:push-down-dpp","ref":"push-down-dpp","sha":"a99d47e055b32eaa3f04af7e6ff57957019f9f4d","user":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140506691,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA1MDY2OTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"weixiuli/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`REGR_AVGX` and `REGR_AVGY` are ANSI aggregate functions.\r\n\r\n`REGR_AVGX` returns the mean of the independent_variable_expression for all

`REGR_AVGX` is: `REGR_AVGX = SUM(x)/n`\r\n\r\n**Examples**:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT _FUNC_(y, x) FROM VALUES (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4) AS tab(y, x);\r\n  2.75\r\n> SELECT _FUNC_(y, x) FROM VALUES (1,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove the upper limit `1` from `spark.kubernetes.memoryOverheadFactor`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.0.0, we support `spark.kubernetes.local.dirs.tmpfs` which allows executor pods to use `tmpfs` storage.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR ([design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10rhvjXUlbQfWg-zh02_aqRqDT_ZnwYmICPAR--aRv64)) provides support to store shuffle files on external shuffle storage like S3. It helps Dynamic\r\nAllocation on Kubernetes. Spark driver could release idle executors without worrying about losing\r\nshuffle data because the shuffle data is store on external shuffle storage which are different\r\nfrom executors.\r\n\r\nThis could be viewed as a followup work for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25299.\r\n\r\nThere is previously Worker Decommission feature ([SPARK-33545](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33545)), which is a great feature to copy shuffle data to fallback storage like S3. People appreciate that work to address the critical issue to handle shuffle data on Spark executor termination. The work in the PR does not intent to replace that feature. The intent is to get further discussion about how to save shuffle data on S3 during normal execution time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo better support Dynamic Allocation on Kubernetes, we need to decouple shuffle data from Spark\r\nexecutor. This PR implements another Shuffle Manager and support writing shuffle data on S3.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR adds two Spark config like following to plug in another StarShuffleManager and store\r\nshuffle data on provided S3 location.\r\n```\r\nspark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.shuffle.StarShuffleManager\r\nspark.shuffle.star.rootDir=s3://my_bucket_name/my_shuffle_folder\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test for StartShuffleManager. A lot of classes are copied from Spark, thus not add tests\r\nfor those classes. We will work with the community to get feedback first, then work on removing code\r\ncopy/duplication.","created_at":"2021-12-10T21:52:31Z","updated_at":"2024-09-07T10:43:28Z","closed_at":"2022-04-17T00:19:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4562a6a4608c9b45bf9ddbd70ef37fffd63610d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a0f4f2fb4221cb2d66e5ae5b057cfaf341060eea","head":{"label":"hiboyang:star","ref":"star","sha":"a0f4f2fb4221cb2d66e5ae5b057cfaf341060eea","user":{"login":"hiboyang","id":14280154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjgwMTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14280154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang","html_url":"https://github.com/hiboyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":324487461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjQ0ODc0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"hiboyang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hiboyang","id":14280154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjgwMTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14280154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang","html_url":"https://github.com/hiboyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hiboyang/spark","description":"Apache

`xxxOnlySupportedWithV2TableError`\r\n3. in CTAS and RTAS, the `if isSessionCatalog(catalog)` should not be on the pattern, it should be `if (isSessionCatalog(catalog) && !isV2Provider(provider))`. Otherwise, `c.partitioning ++ c.tableSpec.bucketSpec.map(_.asTransform)` is not done for non SessionCatalog case.\r\nI tried this  `c.partitioning ++ c.tableSpec.bucketSpec.map(_.asTransform)` inside `AstBuilder` but it failed [here]( https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/command/DDLSuite.scala#L850) so I kept this in `ResolveSessionCatalog`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\ncode cleaning up and bug fixing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds a new config property `spark.defaultListeners` which is intended to be set by administrators to signify the \"default\" set of Spark listeners to be used in the job. This list will be combined with `spark.extraListeners` at runtime. This is similar in spirit to `spark.driver.defaultJavaOptions` and `spark.plugins.defaultList`.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`spark.extraListeners` allows users to custom Spark Listeners. Spark platform administrators would want to set their own set of \"default\" listeners for all jobs on the platform, however using `spark.extraListeners` makes it easy for end users to unknowingly override the default listeners.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, adds new a config property.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing UT to test new config property\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-10T01:10:27Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T00:32:01Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T00:32:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8101db5b9f2af0f51d37bfb62af70943aa7557b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aaf28a3b0d9cfa5536c64d7e2dba1482b969a53c","head":{"label":"shardulm94:listeners-default-list","ref":"listeners-default-list","sha":"aaf28a3b0d9cfa5536c64d7e2dba1482b969a53c","user":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304161240,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQxNjEyNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"shardulm94/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94/spark","description":"Apache

In version 2.3 and earlier, empty strings are equal to null values and do not reflect to any characters in saved CSV files. For example, the row of \"a\", null, \"\", 1 was written as a,,,1. Since Spark 2.4, the same row is saved as a,,\"\",1. To restore the previous behavior, set the CSV option emptyValue to empty (not quoted) string.\r\n\r\nBut actually, we found that null values are also saved as quoted empty strings \"\" as the same as empty strings.\r\n\r\nFor codes follows:\r\n```scala\r\nSeq((\"Tesla\", null.asInstanceOf[String], \"\"))\r\n  .toDF(\"make\", \"comment\", \"blank\")\r\n  .coalesce(1)\r\n  .write.csv(path)\r\n```\r\n\r\nactual results:\r\n>Tesla,\"\",\"\"\r\n\r\nexpected results:\r\n>Tesla,,\"\"\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, if this bug has been fixed, the output of null values would been changed to nothing rather than quoted empty strings \"\".\r\n\r\nBut, users can set nullValue to \"\\\\\"\\\\\"\"(same as emptyValueInWrite's default value) to restore the previous behavior since 2.4.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new AES mode for the `aes_encrypt()`/`aes_decrypt()` functions - `GCM` ([Galois/Counter Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)) w/o padding. The `aes_encrypt()` function returns a binary value which consists of the following fields:\r\n1. An initialization vector (IV) generated per every `aes_encrypt()` call using `java.security.SecureRandom`. The length of IV is 12 bytes.\r\n2. The encrypted input.\r\n3. An authentication tag that can be used to verify the integrity of the data. The length of the tag is 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nThe `aes_decrypt()` functions assumes that its input has the fields as showed above.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT base64(aes_encrypt('Apache Spark', '0000111122223333', 'GCM', 'NONE'));\r\nak3k4wV71YJAjg6d5sUTm15Ag9fyQP0UL/ComBkBxzVvft2NBOCF+g==\r\nspark-sql> SELECT aes_decrypt(unbase64('ak3k4wV71YJAjg6d5sUTm15Ag9fyQP0UL/ComBkBxzVvft2NBOCF+g=='), '0000111122223333', 'GCM', 'NONE');\r\nApache Spark\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo achieve feature parity with other systems/frameworks, and make the migration process from them to Spark SQL easier. For example, the `GCM` mode is supported by:\r\n- BigQuery: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead-encryption-concepts#block_cipher_modes\r\n- Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/encrypt.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The AES functions haven't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new checks:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.ExpressionInfoSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly
