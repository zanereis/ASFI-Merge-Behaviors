#33620\r\n\r\nHalf of the sdk coders have getEncodedElementByteSize  public because they are invoked outside of beam.sdk.coders package. \r\nSome accumulators like ComposedAccumulatorCoder should have access to optimized methods for calculating size but due to it can be any Coder.\r\nOptimized way of calculating size shouldn't be limited to Coders implemented in beam.sdk.coders only.\r\nThis change changes it to public and fixes all the coders in beam sdk.\r\n\r\nThis will break coders implemented in customer codebase requiring small patch to change visibility.

Description\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we enable recursive deletion for Google Cloud Storage (GCS) paths, including directories and blobs. The `delete` method is updated to remove all blobs under a directory (prefix) when deleting GCS directories. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we update the delete test to verify the recursive deletion of directories containing multiple files.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n- Enhanced `delete` method to support recursive directory deletion.\r\n- Added tests for recursive deletion of directories and files.\r\n\r\nFixes #27605\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nBefore             |  After\r\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\r\n![before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac6b70f9-39e9-428d-ab24-ab676bbdb427) |  ![after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8d2a840-285b-42f2-9498-f0c4e1bee02c)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go) from 0.33.0 to 0.35.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/releases\">github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v0.35.0</h2>\n<h1>What's Changed</h1>\n<h2>⚠️ Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>feat(termination)!: make container termination timeout configurable (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/2926\">#2926</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/moogacs\"><code>@​moogacs</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <code>container.Terminate(ctx)</code> method now accepts an extra variadic argument with termination options. The breaking change only affects users assigning this method to a variable, receiving a compile-time error. The rest of the users will simply satisfy the new signature with an empty slice of termination options.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>feat!: build log writer for container request (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/2925\">#2925</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/zenkovev\"><code>@​zenkovev</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <code>ShouldPrintBuildLog</code> function of the <code>ContainerRequest</code> has been removed. Instead, a <code>BuildLogWriter</code> function appears, that returns the user-defined <code>io.Writer</code> for writing the image-build logs. In case there is no writer, and the <code>FromDockerfile.PrintBuildLog</code> is set to true, <code>os.Stderr</code> would be used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>feat(gcloud)!: add support to seed data when using RunBigQueryContainer (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/2523\">#2523</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mtellis2\"><code>@​mtellis2</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Users of the GCloud module and the <code>WithProjectID</code> option must handle the error that this option now returns.

Addresses #20219 \r\n- Introduces `withResults()` API to `DatastoreV1.Write`, `DatastoreV1.DeleteEntity` and `DatastoreV1.DeleteKey` PTransforms, which returns `PCollection<DatastoreV1.WriteSuccessSummary>` instead of `PDone`.\r\n- Allows Wait.on semantics for DatastoreIO, e.g.\r\n```\r\n    PCollection<Entity> firstBatch = ... ;\r\n    PCollection<Entity> secondBatch = ... ;\r\n    PCollection<DatastoreV1.WriteSuccessSummary> firstWriteResults =\r\n        firstBatch.apply(DatastoreIO.v1().write().withProjectId(project).withResults());\r\n\r\n    secondBatch\r\n        .apply(Wait.on(firstWriteResults)) // Allows Wait.on\r\n        .setCoder(secondBatch.getCoder())\r\n        .apply(DatastoreIO.v1().write().withProjectId(project)); // Returns PDone without withResults()\r\n```\r\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API structure\r\n- Draws inspiration from JdbcIO and FirestoreIO connectors\r\n- Modifies unit tests to mock datastore stub to return CommitResponses\r\n- Introduces new integration tests to test the `withResults()` API\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases\">google.golang.org/grpc's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release 1.69.4</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>rbac: fix support for :path header matchers, which would previously never successfully match (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7965\">#7965</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Documentation</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>examples/features/csm_observability: update example client and server to use the helloworld service instead of echo service (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7945\">#7945</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Release 1.69.3 was accidentally tagged on the master branch and will be deleted. Please update to 1.69.4 instead.</p>\n<h2>Release 1.69.2</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>stats/experimental: add type aliases for symbols (<code>Metrics</code>/etc) that were moved to the stats package (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7929\">#7929</a>).</li>\n<li>client: set user-agent string to the correct version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Release 1.69.0</h2>\n<h1>Known Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The recently added <code>grpc.NewClient</code> function is incompatible with forward proxies, because it resolves the target hostname on the client instead of passing the hostname to the proxy. A fix is expected to be a part of grpc-go v1.70. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7556\">#7556</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>stats/opentelemetry: Introduce new APIs to enable OpenTelemetry instrumentation for metrics on servers and clients (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7874\">#7874</a>)</li>\n<li>xdsclient: add support to fallback to lower priority servers when higher priority ones are down (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7701\">#7701</a>)</li>\n<li>dns: Add support for link local IPv6 addresses (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7889\">#7889</a>)</li>\n<li>The new experimental <code>pickfirst</code> LB policy (disabled by default) supports Happy Eyeballs, interleaving IPv4 and IPv6 address as described in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8305#section-4\">RFC-8305 section 4</a>, to attempt connections to multiple backends concurrently. The experimental <code>pickfirst</code> policy can be enabled by setting the environment variable <code>GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_NEW_PICK_FIRST</code> to <code>true</code>.

(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7851\">#7851</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7853\">#7853</a>)</li>\n<li>examples: fix the debugging example, which was broken by a recent change (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7833\">#7833</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Behavior Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>client: update retry attempt backoff to apply jitter per updates to <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md\">gRFC A6</a>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7869\">#7869</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/isgj\"><code>@​isgj</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>balancer/weightedroundrobin: use the <code>pick_first</code> LB policy to manage connections (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7826\">#7826</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>API Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>balancer: An internal method is added to the <code>balancer.SubConn</code> interface to force implementors to embed a delegate implementation.

href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases\">go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>MongoDB Go Driver 1.17.2</h2>\n<p>The MongoDB Go Driver Team is pleased to release version 1.17.2 of the official MongoDB Go driver.</p>\n<h2>Release Notes</h2>\n<p>This release addresses several issues and tasks to improve the functionality of the Go Driver. It includes a fix for a bug in the <code>DefaultValueDecoders.ValueUnmarshalerDecodeValue</code> to avoid  inappropriately instantiating a pointer field decoded from null data if the user defined an <code>UnmarshalBSONValue</code>. Additionally, the release resolves a goroutine and memory leak issue found in the Zstandard (zstd) network compression decoding process.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the release includes a task to restore the <code>ReadCompressedCompressedMessage()</code> function to the wiremessage API. This function was previously removed under task GODRIVER-3303 with the aim of preventing out-of-bounds runtime errors, as it was identified as complicit in such issues and was not needed by the driver itself. However, it has been identified as a convenient utility for some users of the Go Driver.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For a full list of tickets included in this release, please see the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3Dgodriver%20and%20type%3Depic%20and%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.17.2\">Projects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3Dgodriver%20and%20type%3D%22new%20feature%22%20and%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.17.2\">New Features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3Dgodriver%20and%20type%3Dimprovement%20and%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.17.2\">Improvements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3DGODRIVER%20and%20type%3DBug%20and%20status%3Dclosed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.17.2\">Bugs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3Dgodriver%20and%20type%3D%22task%22%20and%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.17.2\">Tasks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/compare/v1.17.1...v1.17.2\">v1.17.1...v1.17.2</a></p>\n<p>Documentation for the Go driver can be found on <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo?tab=doc\">pkg.go.dev</a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/go/\">MongoDB documentation site</a>.

Allows the Go SDK Container to execute as a SideCar worker pool from the default Beam Go container, with the default port of 50000.\r\n* Enables use as a containered local worker pool as described here for the External configuration: https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/sdk-harness-config/\r\n  * All execution is *pooled* locally as per normal.\r\n* Code can be shared to other SDK

compute the minimum watermark from Spanner change stream partitions and cache them for DoFn access.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue that if computing the minimum watermark from the metadata partition table takes over 5s (max time to issue a split for a DoFn), the pipeline will not be able to progress. Here, we initialize a static guava cache that executes the watermark query asynchronously, thus not being limited by the 5s compute time.","created_at":"2025-01-13T02:44:28Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T23:41:24Z","closed_at":"2025-01-16T09:06:11Z","merged_at":"2025-01-16T09:06:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c9fb33baaeee3291754e400d2edb2421a147632","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842938092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTM4MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/gcp","name":"gcp","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3888027569,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc7nvpex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/Next%20Action:%20Reviewers","name":"Next

href=\"http://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning</a>.</h1>\n<h2>(0.41.0) UNRELEASED</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New <code>DISABLE_SPLIT_LIST_WITH_COMMENT</code> flag.\n<code>DISABLE_SPLIT_LIST_WITH_COMMENT</code> is a new knob that changes the\nbehavior of splitting a list when a comment is present inside the list.</p>\n<p>Before, we split a list containing a comment just like we split a list\ncontaining a trailing comma: Each element goes on its own line (unless\n<code>DISABLE_ENDING_COMMA_HEURISTIC</code> is true).</p>\n<p>This new flag allows you to control the behavior of a list with a comment\n<em>separately</em> from the behavior when the list contains a trailing comma.</p>\n<p>This mirrors the behavior of clang-format, and is useful for e.g. forming\n&quot;logical groups&quot; of elements in a list.</p>\n<p>Without this flag:</p>\n<pre><code>[\n  a,\n  b,  #\n  c\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this flag:</p>\n<pre><code>[\n  a, b,  #\n  c\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Before we had one flag that controlled two behaviors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>DISABLE_ENDING_COMMA_HEURISTIC=false</code> (default):\n<ul>\n<li>Split a list that has a trailing comma.</li>\n<li>Split a list that contains a comment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>DISABLE_ENDING_COMMA_HEURISTIC=true</code>:\n<ul>\n<li>Don't split on trailing comma.</li>\n<li>Don't split on comment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now we have two flags.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

is an experimental feature that can be used on Java 21+ by passing pipeline option `--virtualHarnessThreads=true`.\r\n\r\nIn Java 21, virtual threads pin the underlying platform thread when inside synchronized blocks or in native code. When enabling this, care should be taken by user code to not block and pin the harness threads for long.\r\n\r\nTested the feature on sample jobs. Will send separate changes to optimize blocking synchronize blocks, if any, in runner code.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

thing lead to another with this so this PR does a few related things.\r\n\r\n* Exports the windowing strategy struct to configure aggregation stages in the element manager.\r\n  * This is prep-work for fully supporting the rest of the windowing strategies + triggers.\r\n* Uses the above to support AllowedLateness.\r\n* In doing so, it was noted that incorrect conversions from integers (representing durations of nanosecond precision) to `mtime.Time` which is strictly a millisecond duration. This fix revealed two issues with Session Windows.\r\n* Fixes to Session Window Merging\r\n  * Merging wasn't correctly happening per key. Windows were being treated \"globally\".\r\n  * We were incorrectly using the GapSize in prism. GapSize was already accounted for in the generation of the SessionWindow's interval Window representation.\r\n  * These fixes resolved the issue that #32085 was filed for, so the re-written Python test could be removed.\r\n* Late data is now only dropped before aggregations, when it matters most.\r\n  * This avoids a correctness issue dropping data in a Reshuffle.\r\n  * This will be re-evaluated as windowing strategies are implemented, but it's better to have more tests enabled, so they can provide a signal. \r\n\r\nPart of #31438\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

4 is breaking debezium IO - https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33192#issuecomment-2575651407 - I tried fixing this by upgrading debezium in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33526 but found that newer versions are not proto 4 compatible yet (and it is a non-trivial upgrade), so our only real option is forcing proto 3. To best keep up with the google bom we need proto 4, and many users will want to start using this.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that clients that need protobuf should generally be ok with proto 3 for a little while (going the other direction is usually the tough part as of now), so this may be ok. But it is non-ideal and we should address it once we're able.\r\n\r\nFixes #31346\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

transient error might occur when writing a lot of shards to GCS, and right now the GCS IO does not have any retry logic in place:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/a06454a2/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/gcsio.py#L269\r\n\r\nIt means that in such cases the entire bundle of elements fails, and then Beam itself will attempt to retry the entire bundle, and will fail the job if it exceeds the number of retries.\r\n\r\nThis change adds new logic to retry only failed requests, and uses the typical exponential backoff strategy.\r\n\r\nNote that this change accesses a private method (`_predicate`) of the retry object, which we could avoid by basically copying the logic over here. But existing code already accesses `_responses` property so maybe it's not a big deal.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b4c3a4ff/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/gcsio.py#L297\r\n\r\nExisting (unresolved) issue in the GCS client library:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/googleapis/python-storage/issues/1277\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
