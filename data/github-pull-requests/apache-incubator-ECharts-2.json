Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nSome components use `graphic.setTooltipConfig` to provide the tooltip ability and use its name as the default tooltip content. This causes potential XSS issues when the name (like `legend`) is an HTML string. This PR tries to fix it by escaping the raw name from HTML. If users hope to render HTML, they can use `tooltip.formatter` to do that.\r\n\r\n[Before](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/editor.html?c=line-simple&code=PTAEgJ8xwC0GoNB0FQKdUH9qho-ULAqgHz0CCagwHUHxmguT0UHEnAKAGMB7AOwGcAXUAGwFMBzZqgEwDkBDAW2YBGUAF4SoUAHIAPAEt-rUDQBOZUQCIAFnToAHGgC4QzMlt4q6NAHS89vM82sUVrYB2ALe7GsABmvABucpRU1npUrBqgwAB8UgDcJCAQMAgoGDiAoHaAXl6gABIAKgCyADKggG56BKAAGgDKdeTU9ExsHDwCzABMYhLS8orKapo6-kYmZhZWtvaOzq7uVJ783sy-AcGh4ZFCu0LR1MwqKi6anBRkAK6CVHTWAEYUnACe1nJUVEdFZWKgADpSep1AHROKJEgkCh6Ohyai_ADefToFAojBhekMoERkkkdBUclY7BUmKkvAAHnIaFI-gBfAA0fRY7C4mOxOM4vDovExAG0me0-IIhHTWsyOoIugBdBk40DI1Ho1l9WU0LQUADumLxl2YytANNpMtAZIAghSjFi9XRnnpmCSyJy2C5nlIjZIOVzeVJitRXdJCjq_VIAOrMThBwpaS5BgBi-KDdU5CcuVCkksNfWeZsprPpfRoRzka15erZsqonUx_K4guEbpx1ttJMY72Yrr17s53NAPK6XQADCKhAAOLpDgCcwtAXQAzAAWEVdceD0AzmcrmdCfvp2V52VlnEVwRVto1zpjjtym126Qtz7t2Wdz09oRzgCsi7nK5Hw6HADZxyHN8P1AIQAHYF2nP9tz1A1JHTGkEiAA&version=5.5.0)\r\n\r\n[After](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/editor.html?c=line-simple&code=PTAEgJ8xwC0GoNB0FQKdUH9qho-ULAqgHz0CCagwHUHxmguT0UHEnAKAGMB7AOwGcAXUAGwFMBzZqgEwDkBDAW2YBGUAF4SoUAHIAPAEt-rUDQBOZUQCIAFnToAHGgC4QzMlt4q6NAHS89vM82sUVrYB2ALe7GsABmvABucpRU1npUrBqgwAB8UgDcJCAQMAgoGDiAoHaAXl6gABIAKgCyADKggG56BKAAGgDKdeTU9ExsHDwCzABMYhLS8orKapo6-kYmZhZWtvaOzq7uVJ783sy-AcGh4ZFCu0LR1MwqKi6anBRkAK6CVHTWAEYUnACe1nJUVEdFZWKgADpSep1AHROKJEgkCh6Ohyai_ADefToFAojBhekMoERkkkdBUclY7BUmKkvAAHnIaFI-gBfAA0fRY7C4mOxOM4vDovExAG0me0-IIhHTWsyOoIugBdBk40DI1Ho1l9WU0LQUADumLxl2YytANNpMtAZIAghSjFi9XRnnpmCSyJy2C5nlIjZIOVzeVJitRXdJCjq_VIAOrMThBwpaS5BgBi-KDdU5CcuVCkksNfWeZsprPpfRoRzka15erZsqonUx_K4guEbpx1ttJMY72Yrr17s53NAPK6XQADCKhAAOLpDgCcwtAXQAzAAWEVdceD0AzmcrmdCfvp2V52VlnEVwRVto1zpjjtym126Qtz7t2Wdz09oRzgCsi7nK5Hw6HADZxyHN8P1AIQAHYF2nP9tz1A1JHTGkEiAA&version=PR-20045)\r\n\r\n###

series off by 1 pixel \r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nThere is a boundary overflow issue when creating a clipping path in the custom series.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/141796004/c14321c5-f294-48a8-a46a-7fa9c53c95f5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nThe overflow occurs because the clipping path is widened to fully display the first and last ends of the line chart. In the source code, the logic is to first obtain the width of the polyline, and adjust the clipping path based on this width. After consulting the documentation, I found that under custom If you do not set the lineStyle attribute, you must ensure that the chart without the lineStyle attribute is trimmed strictly according to the grid. Then you only need to set the chart without the lineStyle attribute not to expand.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/141796004/cbc8c667-a169-4754-b40e-e0a9a9f72960)\r\n\r\nThis change will have an impact on charts that do not have the lineStyle.width attribute but use a clipping path, but the impact is reasonable and acceptable, such as the following case\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/141796004/f37d3270-2cd8-4025-bbb3-9a9cae6bc13b)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/141796004/3a0163cd-fe51-4e24-99e7-8ccc052441e0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##

series off by 1 pixel \r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nThere is a boundary overflow issue when creating a clipping path in the custom series.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/141796004/7ef061da-a5b0-429f-bb01-03be42229fe8)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nModified part of the logic for the clipping path. Since the custom type does not include the `lineStyle` property, the thickness of the axis line cannot be correctly obtained. It is necessary to obtain the thickness of the axis lines before adjusting the position and size of the clipping path.\r\nChanging the thickness of the axis lines will not cause overflow.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/141796004/be296609-9000-467c-9648-094055668ca6)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/141796004/f68a11e5-2883-4ce0-98aa-4d55a690ba26)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##

can not visit `'echarts/types/dist/shared.d.ts'` since v5.5.0.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\nFix #19663 .\r\nRelative issues: https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts/issues/766 , https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/19513\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nIn users' .d.ts `import('echarts/types/dist/shared')` can not visit `'echarts/types/dist/shared.d.ts'` since v5.5.0.\r\nIt cause that users can only get type `any` when import echarts type.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nAfter some investigate to `tsc`, I found that:\r\n\r\nTest case (tested in typescript v5.3.3 and v4.6.4) :\r\n+ Case_A:\r\n    ```ts\r\n    /** @file main1.ts (user's source ts files) */\r\n    import { init } from \"echarts/core\";\r\n    type EChartsType1 = ReturnType<typeof init>;\r\n    export let option = {} as EChartsType1;\r\n    ```\r\n    ```ts\r\n    /** @file main1.d.ts (tsc generated d.ts file) */\r\n    // Has inline import() generated, and refer deeply to \"echarts/types/dist/shared\",\r\n    // in which `EChartsType` is declared literally.\r\n    export declare let option: import(\"echarts/types/dist/shared\").EChartsType;\r\n    ```\r\n+ Case_B:\r\n    ```ts\r\n    /** @file main2.ts (user's source ts files) */\r\n    import { init } from \"echarts/core\";\r\n    type InitType = typeof init;\r\n    type EChartsType1 = ReturnType<InitType>;\r\n    export let option: EChartsType1; // This is the only difference from \"main1.ts\".\r\n    ```\r\n    ```ts\r\n    /** @file main2.d.ts (tsc generated d.ts file) */\r\n    // No inline import() generated.\r\n    import { init } from \"echarts/core\";\r\n    type EChartsType1 = ReturnType<typeof init>;\r\n    export declare let option: EChartsType1;\r\n    export {};\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nIn the case about we can found that:\r\n\r\n+ `tsc` may generate \"inline import\" (i.e., `import(xxx/xxx/xxx)`) or not.\r\n    + In face `tsc` may intentionally generate inline import to avoid to handle name collision. see <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30258#issuecomment-470727688> <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/36097#issuecomment-582668813>.\r\n+ When generate inline import `import(xxx/xxx/xxx)`, the path `xxx/xxx/xxx` probably goes deep into the file where the target type declared literally defined, but may not consider its visibility defined in \"exports\" field of `package.json`.\r\n    + Take the Case_A above as am example, the target type need to be resolved is `EChartsType` from the last sentence `export let option = {} as EChartsType1;`, and `EChartsType` is declared in `echarts/types/dist/shared.d.ts`, the final inline import is `import('echarts/types/dist/shared')` or `import('echarts/types/dist/shared.js')`, although `echarts/types/dist/shared` seems to be a private file and imported by `echarts/core.d.ts`.\r\n    + There is some investigation into the source code of `tsc`. It's verbose, just for the record:\r\n        + When travel and parse ts file starting from [`transformRoot`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/v5.3.3/src/compiler/transformers/declarations.ts#L486),\r\n        + in which [`function symbolToTypeNode`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/v5.3.3/src/compiler/checker.ts#L7974) is called to resolve the literal type `EChartsType1` of the sentence `export let option = {} as EChartsType1;`,\r\n        + in which `lookupSymbolChain` is called to use the input `symbol(of \"EChartsType\")` to get a chain like `[symbol(of \"dist/shared.d.ts\"), symbol(of \"EChartsType\")]`, and generate a specifier for `chain[0]`, and call `const lit = factory.createLiteralTypeNode(factory.createStringLiteral(specifier));` to create a literal node containing the path 'xxx/dist/shared', and call `return factory.createImportTypeNode(lit, ...)` to return a new type node on which the literal node is mounted.\r\n        + So for the original type node \"EChartsType\" has been resolved the a type node \"xxx/dist/shared\".\r\n        + Finally in [`writeKeyword(\"import\");  writePunctuation(\"(\"); emit(node.argument);`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/v5.3.3/src/compiler/emitter.ts#L2949) the literal node of 'xxx/dist/shared' generated above is in the `node.argument` and be used to write as `import('xxx/dist/shared')`.\r\n    + Both `ambient module declaration file` or `normal module file` has the same behavior.\r\n        ```ts\r\n        /** @file echarts/core.d.ts (An ambient module declarataion file) */\r\n        declare module \"echarts/core\" {\r\n            export * from 'echarts/types/dist/core';\r\n        }\r\n        ```\r\n        ```ts\r\n        /** @file echarts/core.d.ts (An normal module file) */\r\n        export * from './types/dist/core';\r\n        ```\r\n+ Either `import('echarts/types/dist/shared')` or `import('echarts/types/dist/shared.js')` can be generated by `tsc`.\r\n    + For the case `import('echarts/types/dist/shared.js')`: \r\n        + Generated like that when setting `\"moduleResolution\": \"node\"` in \"tsconfig.json\".\r\n        + Although this file does not exist, it seems OK in d.ts file to used it, `tsc` can resolve it back to `echarts/types/dist/shared.d.ts` (tested in tsc v4.6.4 & v5.3.3).\r\n    + For the case `import('echarts/types/dist/shared')`: \r\n        + Generated like that when setting `\"moduleResolution\": \"bundle\"` in \"tsconfig.json\".\r\n        + this is case of the bug https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/19513 . Since echarts v5.5.0, `echarts/types/dist/shared` is not visible from outside. So this PR make it visible by add it to the \"exports\" field of `package.json`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other infomation\r\n\r\n1. \r\nIn <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue-echarts@6.7.3/dist/index.d.ts> there are both `import(\"echarts/types/dist/shared\")` and `import(\"echarts/types/dist/echarts\")`. It because in <https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts/blob/v6.7.3/src/types.ts#L2> both from 'echarts/core' and 'echarts'.\r\n```ts\r\nimport { init } from \"echarts/core\";\r\nimport type {

Fix:** This PR is intended to update the `hideOverlap` functionality to prevent empty labels (`\"\"`) from being considered as candidates for the overlap checking.\r\n  - Perhaps there is a better way of ignoring labels with no text, such as setting them to `ignore = true` in the label creation process and then checking if a label is ignored before doing the overlapping comparison check, but I was unsure if that was the right way to go.

`number` type, which is the jitter max range in pixels\r\n\r\n```text\r\naxis\r\n    jitter: number, max range in pixels that scatters can range from\r\n    jitterOverlap: boolean, whether scatters can overlap each other\r\n    jitterMargin: if jitterOverlap is false, the margin of scatters from each other\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nJittering is useful in scatter plots for:\r\n\r\n- Overlapping Data Points: Prevents points with the same or similar values from overlapping.\r\n- Categorical Axes: Distinguishes points within the same category.\r\n- Small Sample Sizes: Separates closely clustered data points.\r\n- Discrete Data: Helps with data naturally falling into specific values (e.g., counts).\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be

-->\r\n\r\n`aria-label` was set on the DOM element, but in SSR there is no DOM element, so it would throw when enabling `aria` or `locals` in options when using SSR, because the `dom` variable in code is `null`.\r\n\r\nAlso, this makes the last example in [this release note](https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/en/basics/release-note/v5-feature/) (Two color locals) not working in SSR.\r\n\r\n<!--

...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\n\r\nStarting from version 6.6.10 of vue-echarts, the style of the container has been modified to include position:absolute. This change results in an update being triggered when switching routes, where an inline style of position:relative is added to the container, causing it to lose its height.\r\n\r\nReproducible Git repository address: https://github.com/SadWood/vue-quick-start-template/tree/echarts_bug\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n<!-- THE RESULT AFTER FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\nThe values returned by getComputedStyle are resolved values, so it's straightforward to determine whether getComputedStyle(container, 'position') is 'absolute' or not.\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be

test case addresses the issue where the time axis in ECharts incorrectly generates labels for series with no data, resulting in misleading visual indications on the graph. The should generate correct labels for time axis with non-empty data series test ensures that labels are correctly generated for time axes with valid data points, verifying that the date range is accurately represented. Conversely, the should not generate labels for empty data series on a time axis test confirms that no labels are produced when the data series is empty, preserving the integrity of the axis range. This improvement is essential for maintaining accurate data representation, particularly in dynamic charts where data streams might intermittently have empty series.","created_at":"2024-04-24T08:01:30Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T09:30:35Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577033497,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDMzNDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20revision%20needed","name":"PR:

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- Replaces global `isFinite` with `Number.isFinite` and unary (`+`) with `Number()` conversion so that a simple chart doesn't blow up when passing in a `BigInt`\r\n\r\n### ~Fixed~ Related issues\r\n\r\n- Related to #19237 (addresses a small part of it)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nWhen passing a `BigInt` data column to a chart, the chart blows up.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/638946/c0661a57-f6d4-41d3-90f5-3347c634bbe6)\r\n\r\n```\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number\r\n    at isFinite (<anonymous>)\r\n    at detectValue (chunk-TNIQ5HHQ.js?v=9ea597be:5513:25)\r\n    at doGuessOrdinal (chunk-TNIQ5HHQ.js?v=9ea597be:5494:21)\r\n    at guessOrdinal

happens because of the way `isFinite`, `isNaN`, and `+` (unary operator) coerces the values. `isFinite` and `isNaN` implicitly converts the values in a way that's incompatible with `BigInt`. \r\n\r\nThe `Number.isFinite()` and `Number.isNaN()` methods work [in a more predictable way](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN#description) by not casting non-numeric values implicitly - We can do that explicitly using `Number()` which can be more [_more performant_](https://jsperf.app/momomi)) and does work with `BigInt`\r\n\r\nThe unary `+` operator conversion will likely never be supported for `BigInt` [for compatibility reasons with ASM](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#dont-break-asmjs), while `Number()` does (with possible loss of precision)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n<!-- THE RESULT AFTER FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\nChart is rendered without crashing 🚀 \r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have

the new APIs\r\n\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to address some of the conversion issues in other places of the codebase too. That would require quite a few changes though; I've kept this PR small to increase its chances of being merged 👀 \r\n\r\nThank you 🙏

Overview\r\nThis Pull Request introduces a new mobile-specific feature for the `dataZoom` component within ECharts. It resolves feature #19732, which requests the implementation of mobile dataZoom-Inside for horizontal and vertical using touch gestures and scrolling scale using mouse.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\nThe following are the key changes made in this PR:\r\n- Enhanced `InsideZoomModel.ts` and `InsideZoomView.ts` to support touch gesture recognition for mobile devices.\r\n- Integrated new gesture handling logic that distinguishes between horizontal and vertical gestures to apply data zoom accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nManual testing was conducted to confirm the functionality. Test file : test/test-scroll-zoom.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy merging this PR, ECharts will provide an enhanced interactive experience for mobile users, allowing more precise control over data visualization.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/72302467/2244f34a-acad-4cd1-85fe-099e5e09ec1f)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- Additional testing on a wider range of devices is recommended to ensure universal compatibility and responsiveness.\r\n- Further feedback from the community can be valuable for iterative improvement of the touch interaction model.\r\n\r\nResolves: #19732\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-15T22:55:56Z","updated_at":"2024-05-25T16:07:09Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d215e99724f7e03de3f27faa34f1c6021c0ddca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577024536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDI0NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20awaiting%20review","name":"PR:

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- bug fixing.\r\n- refactoring.\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses a specific limitation concerning [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP). When CSP is enabled, direct assignments to an element's style property using a string are disallowed. However it is possible to use className instead.\r\n\r\nBasically, innerHTML causes the violation because it inserts html that contains inline styles.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n[Tree chart with tooltips is not compliant with strict CSP directives for styles](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/19570)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nCSP violation errors are thrown into browser console:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"793\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/18514351/dfc2c049-05e3-4cb2-b2f9-8a2883f9594c\">\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nIt no longer uses inline styles.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"image\"

This PR prevents X-axis coord dimension when Y-axis coord dimension is also stackable which allows having stacked vertical charts while not changing the API.\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly support stacked horizontal charts with both stackable axes, the API should be extended.\r\n\r\n[Minimal reproduction](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=line-simple&code=PYBwLglsB2AEC8sDeAoWsAeBBDEDOAXMmurGAJ4gCmRA5AG4CGANgK5W0A0J6AthNCIAGbqVi9GGIgGYSAX1GxyOfEVRiK1OkzYd5ivFQBOEKoVgBtHsTHoAJozCMiFiwEZObgExCAup0svTh8_f2t0TRpYWgAjRiMucNg8JwBjAGs6FmZaawVrdVsHJxd3Tx9_QOChUMUNSijY-MTbZLTM6OzcsTkSXxQ5AG4gA)\r\n\r\nECharts supports stacking on the other continuous scale `time` so it would make sense to support it for `value` as well. Multiple created issues requesting the feature validate the needs of the community.\r\n\r\n**Why not to approximate it with the `category` scale?**\r\n\r\nApproximating continuous `value` scale with `category` one is not a great option because there is limitless set of sparse datasets which require adding many fake values to make the scale look continuous which affects performance. At the same time, the added fake empty values will be no distinguishable with real empty values coming from the dataset. This affects `connectNulls` option. Finally, besides the inability to provide the same functionality and experience with the approximation, it also disproportionately complicates the client code: find gcd of each interval, consider number of intervals per pixel, handle x-axis ticks so it shows only \"nice\" values, etc.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #16765\r\n- #19400\r\n- #17522\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nStacking did not work on `value` xAxis.

It is decided based on X and Y axes types: if X-axis is ordinal or time, then it is a vertical chart but if Y-axis is one of these types then it is a horizontal chart. This leads to the undefined behavior when both X and Y axes have value type and there should be an option to set it explicitly for such cases. This PR strives to provide a minimalistic fix without changing API and breaking any existing defined behavior. It follows [already existing logic](https://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/master/src/coord/cartesian/Cartesian2D.ts#L93) of giving preference to X-axis dimension as the one to be stacked on dimension.","created_at":"2024-02-27T19:59:18Z","updated_at":"2024-11-12T11:31:07Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8495d06f091021ae95fdc6d33ea6910b5442978f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577033497,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDMzNDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20revision%20needed","name":"PR:

pull request fixes the logic of computing stacked on points of stacked areas which fixes areas overflow on null values when `connectNulls` is true.\r\n\r\nStacked on value can be `NaN` when:\r\n1) When the value of series exists but there is no series below it or the series it is stacked on do not have suitable values according to `stackStrategy`\r\n2) When the value of series itself is `NaN`\r\n\r\nThe `getStackedOnPoint` function behaved the same in both scenarios, when the stacked on value is `NaN` it decided that the area should be stacked on the `valueStart` of the series coordinates. However, when the value of series itself is `NaN` the stacked on value should be NaN as well for `connectNulls` option to work correctly and just connect the line without dropping it to the start of coordinates.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/19598\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/17135\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThere is an existing test case `area-stack.html` which has a chart affected by the issue.\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nYellow and blue areas have enabled `connectNulls` so the lines in the middle are connected but areas drop to the start of coordinates.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1442\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-08 at 4 29 21 PM\"

connected but also areas.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1439\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-08 at 4 28 39 PM\"

https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/19513\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes:\r\n+ (1) Mistake in package.json \"exports\".\"require\".\r\n+ (2) Add entry for dist/** for \"file extension not specified\" usage. \r\n+ (3) Add `dist/echarts.esm.mjs` (after build). Originally there is only `dist/echarts.esm.js`, which is a ESM file. Since `dist/package.json` with `{\"type\": \"commonjs\"}` is added, webpack5 can not recognize it as ESM by default. This is a breaking change. So add `dist/echarts.esm.mjs` for the uses that get that trouble.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-04T06:37:27Z","updated_at":"2024-02-04T06:55:39Z","closed_at":"2024-02-04T06:55:29Z","merged_at":"2024-02-04T06:55:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3fa16caf01c280f71c6b343517e5abf846002de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577042621,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDQyNjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20author%20is%20committer","name":"PR:

markers are opaque in parallel series, and the default opacity of parallel series is 0.45, so the tooltip The marker's opacity is also 0.45.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/master/src/component/legend/LegendView.ts#L610-L615\r\n```typescript\r\n    if ((itemStyle.opacity as any) === 'inherit') {\r\n        /**\r\n

SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR shrinks the grid size such that the axis labels and names are completely contained (Option (B) of https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/9265#issuecomment-434022070).\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #xxxx: ....\r\n-->\r\n- #9265: xAxis.nameGap and yAxis.nameGap should be set automatically given grid.containLabel\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\n\r\nWhen `grid.containLabel` is set to true, the axis names overlap with the labels, when there is no magical number for `nameGap` specified. Furthermore, the names may be not visible when specifying the `nameGap`, because the names get pushed out of the grid. Therefore, also the distance between the grid and the container needs to be adjusted.\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n<img width=\"782\" alt=\"before\"

SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\n\r\nWhen `grid.containLabel` is set to true, the axis names do not overlap with labels and the grid size is shrinked such that the names are completely visible without the need to specify the grid to container distance or `nameGap`.\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n<img width=\"782\" alt=\"After\"

How a package is published as both CJS and ESM\r\nBrief:\r\n+ Most packages are not bothered by this issue because they only publish a bundled file. But packages that publish lots of files in `lib` dir probably need to consider this issue. We only discuss this scenario below.\r\n+ Solution_A: publish two directories, one for CJS(js+dts) and another for ESM(js+dts). This solution is used more often.\r\n  + example: `antd@5.12.5`\r\n+ Solution_B: use `\"type\": \"module\"` in the root `package.json`. This solution is not many appear.\r\n  + examples that use `\"type\": \"module\"` in the root `package.json`: `chart.js@4.4.1`, `d3@7.8.5`\r\n  + example that add some separate `package.json` only contains `\"type\": \"commonjs\"` in some sub-directory: `underscore@1.13.6`\r\n+ Currently we use Solution_B for minify modifications.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n+ https://github.com/sheremet-va/dual-packaging\r\n+ https://antfu.me/posts/publish-esm-and-cjs\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## 4.4. About \"fully specified file extension\"\r\nCommonJS have file extension auto-completion but ESM require fully specified by default after `\"type\": \"module\"` is set to `package.json`. \r\nThat is, \r\n```js\r\nimport * as obj from 'echarts/charts';\r\n// can not be resolved as echarts/charts.js by default in nodejs ESM.\r\n// But we need it be resolved as echarts/charts.js for backward compat.\r\n```\r\nAfter `\"type\": \"module\"` is set to `package.json`, at least both nodejs and browser and some bundlers (like webpack5) follow this rule by default. It brings trouble to echarts and zrender in backward compatibility, because historically they has many internal files imported by other packages without file extension specified.\r\n\r\nSee the solution in the next section \"set 'exports' in package.json\".\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n+ Explanation of \"fully specified\": https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#mandatory-file-extensions\r\n+ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69427025/programmatic-webpack-jest-esm-cant-resolve-module-without-js-file-exten\r\n+ webpack follow nodeJS \"fully specified\" cause breaking change: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11467#issuecomment-691873586\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## 4.5. Why we need to set `\"exports\"` in package.json\r\n\r\n`\"exports\"` field of `package.json` enables packages to define which files are public and which are private. Although this mechanism is useful for a package management system, but it is not introduced for a long time in npm and the spec has been changed several times, it cause that not all runtime/bundlers fully support all the features in the current spec (consider there are legecy versions of runtime/bundlers). So if we use them, we have to be very carefully. (reference: `\"exports\"` and `\"type\": \"module\"` is supported since nodejs v12.17.0 (and unflagged conditional exports since v13.7.0, v12.17.0) (see <https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.20.2/docs/api/packages.html#modules-packages>)\r\n\r\nAt present we add `\"exports\"` mainly for resolving the \"file extension fully specified\" issue above. (see more info about \"fully specified\" in the previous section.) \r\nFor example, the setting below \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"module\",\r\n  \"exports\": {\r\n    \"./core\": \"./core.js\",\r\n    \"./core.js\": \"./core.js\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nenables `import 'echarts/core'` (file extension is not specified) to work (when `\"type\": \"module\"` is set).\r\n\r\nBut using `\"exports\"` brings some troubles when importing lots of internal files with \"file extension not specified\" way.\r\nNote that if `\"exports\"` is set, the files that are not lists in `\"exports\"` will not be visible from outside. But historically echarts and zrender has many internal files imported by other packages (and without file extension specified).\r\ne.g. `import * as echarts 'echarts/lib/echarts'`, `import 'echarts/lib/chart/line';`, ..., which are deprecated usage since v5 but widely used. And some internal utils of echarts and zrender are also been imported in that way. Currently we do not recommend that but need to keep backward compatible. \r\n\r\nThe neat way to compat it is to use the [subpath patterns](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.20.2/docs/api/packages.html#subpath-patterns)\r\ne.g., make `\"exports\"` of `package.json` like that:\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n  \"exports\": {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"./*.js\": \"./*.js\", \r\n    \"./*\": \"./*.js\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt routes all 'xxx' to 'xxx.js' and all 'xxx.js' to 'xxx.js' (rather than 'xxx.js.js').\r\n\r\nBut the spec of the [subpath patterns](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.20.2/docs/api/packages.html#subpath-patterns) seems to have been keeping changing. For example, at the beginning, it seem that only trailing wildcard is supported, that is, only supports `\"./xxx/*\": \"...\"` but does not support `\"./xxx/*.js\": \"...\"`. It cause that some old versions of bundlers/runtimes do not support the newest spec. e.g., rollup plugin node-resovle v11.0.1 only supports wildcards at the end and do not support `\"./xxx/*.js\": \"...\"`. (see impl: [findExportKeyMatch](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/blob/node-resolve-v11.0.1/packages/node-resolve/src/resolveImportSpecifiers.js#L20) and [findEntrypoint](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/blob/node-resolve-v11.0.1/packages/node-resolve/src/resolveImportSpecifiers.js#L77) ). \r\nIn this situation, if setting to `{ \"./*.js\": \"./*.js\", \"./*\": \"./*.js\" }`, once `\"./*.js\"` is not recognized, `import './xxx.js';` will be resolved as `./xxx.js.js`, which is not expected.\r\nif setting to `{ \"./*\": \"./*\" }`, `import './xxx';` will be resolved as `'./xxx'` and can not find the file because there is no file extension.\r\n\r\nFinally the only way I find is to list all the possible files in `\"exports\"`, ending with a `{ \"./*\": \"./*\" }`.\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n  \"exports\": {\r\n    // ...\r\n    // List the possible entries without file extension specified used outside.\r\n    // The list is search from github.\r\n    \"./lib/chart/bar\": \"./lib/chart/bar.js\",\r\n    \"./lib/chart/boxplot\": \"./lib/chart/boxplot.js\",\r\n    \"./lib/chart/candlestick\": \"./lib/chart/candlestick.js\",\r\n    \"./lib/chart/custom\": \"./lib/chart/custom.js\",\r\n    \"./lib/chart/effectScatter\": \"./lib/chart/effectScatter.js\",\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    // Support that `import 'echarts/xxx/xxx.js'`\r\n    \"./*\": \"./*\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt's ugly. Is there any better idea?\r\n\r\nNote: webpack \r\n- supports `\"exports\"` since v5.0.0\r\n- supports \"not fully specified continue resolve\" in v5.2.0 ([enhanced-resolve v5.3.0](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve/releases/tag/v5.3.0), Oct 20, 2020)\r\n- supports wildcard in `\"exports\"` since v5.13.0 ([enhanced-resolve v5.6.0](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve/releases/tag/v5.6.0) Jan 12, 2021)\r\n\r\nReferences about compat:\r\n  + https://webpack.js.org/guides/package-exports/#support\r\n  + webpack 4 does not recognize it.\r\n\r\n> Note:\r\n> + If using `\"exports\"`, the files that are not declared in `\"exports\"` will be invisible from outside any more.\r\n> + The path must start with `'.'`.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## 4.6. Use physical entry file or alias in `\"exports\"` of `package.json`\r\n\r\nAlthough using `\"exports\"` of `package.json` we can make alias (or say, route) to physical file (for example: `{ \"exports\": { \"./xxx\": \"./yyy/zzz.js\" } }` enables `import 'echarts/xxx'` to route to `'echarts/yyy/zzz.js'`), at present we can not make sure all the versions of bundle tools and runtimes in use do it consistently. So we do not use the alias setting, but keep providing physical file for each public entry. For example, for an official public entry `'echarts/core'`, we provide a file `echarts/core.js` (and `echarts/core.d.ts`).\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n---\r\n# 5.

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n#18381 set some required metadata for SVG elements but it didn't skip the undefined values, which caused the chart to generate many redundant attributes with the 'undefined' value.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I add a precheck for `dataIndex`. It will skip to set SSR data if the `dataIndex` is not present.\r\n\r\nAlso, I fixed an unexpected assignment:\r\n```diff\r\n- childECData.ssrType === 'chart';\r\n+ childECData.ssrType = 'chart';\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides, I also added a non-null check in zrender. Please refer to ecomfe/zrender#1048.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n#18381\r\n\r\n## Comparison\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| :----: | :----: |\r\n| <img

expressing the lunch break (11:30-13:00) on intraday stock trading charts.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb9128f2-6884-479f-8c01-3782accc913a)\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes `indicesOfNearest` from `DataStore` to `Series` so that when in axisPointer, we can compare the data in the view coordinate rather ran data value, so that the nearest data is more intuitive since it's nearer to the mouse position.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #xxxx: ...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [x] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#xxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on ZRender changes (ecomfe/zrender#xxx).\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nWhen doing visual tests agains `v6` branches, there are 4 diffs:\r\n\r\n- `axis-break`: This is the new test file for this feature so it's expected to be different\r\n- `tooltip-axisPointer-snap`: This is the new test file for `indicesOfNearest` and it checks if axisPointer snaps to the nearest data in view coord instead of data value so it's expected to be different\r\n- `area-large`: Due to the change of `indicesOfNearest`, it's now always get the nearest data. But before, some position may don't show tooltip (probably due to large data filtering). So it's expected to be different.\r\n- `pie-label-extreme`: After adding the logic to hiding label elements with zero width and height, the pie labelLines with no label text (due to truncation) will not be displayed. This is a more reasonable presentation because it seems to be not expected to show labelLine when there is not label displayed.\r\n\r\n![截屏2025-01-15 17 19

REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\nThere was no easy option for pie charts to control the radius of items. In current version I can control either the whole pie radius or use some autocalculations with `roseType` option. May be, i can build many pies with single items and different start/end angles and personal pie radius, but this is mean also a lot of code around the lib every time. All this are not suitable for our tasks. Earlier we used dashboards in PowerBI and the same feature in PBI looked like:\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/16826622/0913325e-6a88-4aa3-be48-062b5c4464a9)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/16826622/e29cd6b2-9a89-4110-b32f-b61611ba10fc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n<!-- THE RESULT AFTER FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\nThe solution is very similar with [scatter charts](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=bubble-gradient) and its `symbolSize` option. Now (with this PR) i can pass custom function `itemRadiusScale`, which returns value from 0 to 1. That value is used within pie component to calculate outer radius for each item. In simple words, we now have a third dimension for each item, which represents the size from center to the outer circle, almost like a scatter has x and y coordinates and a personal radius.\r\n\r\nIf I provide custom non-linear function (see test file), I will get the same behaviour as in PBI. Like with logarithmic type Y-axis on XY charts, I can increase small numbers to see data more clearly.\r\n\r\nAlso, few calculated values (sum, maxValue) passed into `getDataParams` callback to make tooltip calculations easier. Not sure about necessary of `maxValue`, but `sum` is really helpful to calculate percents in formatters. And, when I disable some series on a legend, percents still calculated as I expected (it would be a pain without the `sum` option).\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/16826622/8ad263ba-7e5b-45cd-b74d-896d70d65409)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [x] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#xxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on ZRender changes (ecomfe/zrender#xxx).\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\n`test/pie-itemRadiusScale.html`\r\n\r\nhere some content from the test file\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/16826622/2464bf2c-48d4-4f20-b84b-c3a7c18e73d9\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [x] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR here.

problem?\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\nThe bar-chart ignores the yAxis.min setting and instead seems to use the auto-calculated value. In min-max-axis.html test case as you can see, the max is not set so it fails auto-calculating the axis labels. \r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n<img width=\"822\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 11 45 55 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/mertokten/ECE444-F2023-Assignment1/assets/31061207/0cc7491b-e72d-4caa-860a-33f9f0a17ab1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n<!-- THE RESULT AFTER FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\nThe yAxis minimum value should be as specified. (yAxis min is set 5 in our case). It was fixed by when either one is fixed and the other is not,by making sure that the min is always smaller than the max and also the vice versa. Finally after adjusting the min and max we set the minFixed or maxFixed to true so that it won't auto calculate a wrong axis label.\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n<img width=\"803\"

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEdge arrows now scale upon zooming in and out in graph view, just like the nodes\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n#19311 \r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nWhen zooming in and out on a graph, the nodes scale properly, but the arrows on the edges do not. This results in a visual imbalance where the arrows appear disproportionately large or small compared to the nodes at different zoom levels, leading to a degradation in the readability and aesthetic appeal of the graph.\r\n\r\nBefore Zooming:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-12 at 01 15 38](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/82098467/3369499d-02ac-47c0-b6a9-859a2f2a499a)\r\nAfter Zooming:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-12 at 01 15 53](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/82098467/551ee881-217d-4547-b964-49bf7d4f586f)\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nThe arrows on the edges now scale in proportion with the nodes, maintaining a consistent and relative size at all zoom levels, ensuring a balanced and visually coherent graph representation, irrespective of the zoom.\r\n\r\nHere the node is size 20 and arrow is 10. As shown in the screenshots, on both zoom levels, the arrow appears to be about half as large as the node.\r\n\r\nBefore Zooming:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-12 at 01 16

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\nAdd option to dataZoom to support nature move or smoothly move/scale when using track pad like on track pad of mac.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ x] bug fixing\r\n- [ x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\nAdd an option called natureMoveOnMouseWheel of dataZoom to support this feature.\r\nWhen this option is set to true. The behavior of mac track pad on chart will act as on a normal page. Which means you can move up/down and zoom the chart in/out using two fingers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n\r\n- #17286\r\n- #17288\r\n- [related issue](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-data-portal/issues/4200)\r\n- [related issue2](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/sci-components/issues/523)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\nWe can't use the touchpad to move the dataZoom. We just can scale it. And I wish that we can use the touchpad to move the dataZoom window. Such as lots of software, they can use the touchpad to scroll x direction and y direction both.\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nYou can see the test file in the `test/gesture.html` see the result.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/33452468/24cbd002-c67b-406c-8fa7-a6c2660678b1\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nAdds an option to auto-rotate category labels based on available space, specified category interval, and the list of provided rotations.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- [#14996](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/14996)\r\n- [#9265](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/9265) (partially)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nThe [axis label rotation option](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#xAxis.axisLabel.rotate) enhances usability of charts with a large number of categories and/or long category names by sparing the user the effort of hovering over specific value just to see its corresponding category; the usability enhancement is even greater for non-interactive, statically rendered charts.  The rotation option currently has to be chosen beforehand, though, which is suboptimal when a chart is populated with dynamic data -- depending on the data, the labels might or might need to be rotated, and the optimal rotation angle might vary.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new `axisLabel.autoRotate: boolean | number[]` option, which works in concert with the `axisLabel.interval: 'auto'` and `grid.containLabel: true` options to automatically manage (category) label rotation, interval, and layout:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/3394202/2e672060-6500-4db9-9a9b-ecc85a38329e\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/3394202/78263dae-595d-4cee-8c7a-9e5e03fcbfa5\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/3394202/f8c13285-38c3-44a8-b020-8dba833eeed6\r\n\r\n\r\n##

issues\r\n\r\nEssencially, if you change the showDelay and hideDelay options for a tooltip and you have multiple charts on a page, once you hover an item and get a tooltip, if you move fast to the other chart, that tooltip on the first chart would show up again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nJust added a _showTimeout (same way you already do for the hideTimeout), that can be cancelled after hiding once\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-16T18:27:02Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T06:44:03Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbfe4b5f7db5fa5f3be8bdb512588d0e81f4fbfc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577033497,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDMzNDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20revision%20needed","name":"PR:
