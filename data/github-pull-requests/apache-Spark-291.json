Parquet-avro writes the Avro fixed type as a Parquet FIXED_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY type. Currently when trying to load Parquet files with a column of this type with Spark SQL it throws an exception similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Illegal Parquet type: FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY;\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetToSparkSchemaConverter.illegalType$1(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:108)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetToSparkSchemaConverter.convertPrimitiveField(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:177)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetToSparkSchemaConverter.convertField(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:90)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetToSparkSchemaConverter$$anonfun$2.apply(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:72)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetToSparkSchemaConverter$$anonfun$2.apply(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:66)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:234)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:234)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator$class.foreach(Iterator.scala:893)\r\n\tat scala.collection.AbstractIterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:1336)\r\n\tat scala.collection.IterableLike$class.foreach(IterableLike.scala:72)\r\n\tat scala.collection.AbstractIterable.foreach(Iterable.scala:54)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike$class.map(TraversableLike.scala:234)\r\n\tat scala.collection.AbstractTraversable.map(Traversable.scala:104)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetToSparkSchemaConverter.org$apache$spark$sql$execution$datasources$parquet$ParquetToSparkSchemaConverter$$convert(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:66)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetToSparkSchemaConverter.convert(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:63)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat$$anonfun$readSchemaFromFooter$2.apply(ParquetFileFormat.scala:642)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat$$anonfun$readSchemaFromFooter$2.apply(ParquetFileFormat.scala:642)\r\n\tat scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:121)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat$.readSchemaFromFooter(ParquetFileFormat.scala:642)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat$$anonfun$9.apply(ParquetFileFormat.scala:599)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat$$anonfun$9.apply(ParquetFileFormat.scala:581)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$mapPartitions$1$$anonfun$apply$23.apply(RDD.scala:800)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$mapPartitions$1$$anonfun$apply$23.apply(RDD.scala:800)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.rdd.MapPartitionsRDD.compute(MapPartitionsRDD.scala:38)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.computeOrReadCheckpoint(RDD.scala:324)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.iterator(RDD.scala:288)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:87)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:109)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:345)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this change Spark SQL is able to correctly load the Parquet files. There was a PR to fix this 3 years ago (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1737) however it was ultimately rejected as the committer went down the path of adding a new SQL Type specifically for FIXED_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAYs and the maintainers believed this was too intrusive of a change. This PR simply defaults to Binary if no OriginalType is specified. A few updates were required to the VectorizedColumnReader to support Binary FIXED_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAYs.\r\n\r\nNote: All the changes to the gen-java/* files were generated by avro-tools-1.8.1 and the mostly documentation updates look to come from changes in the template avro-tools uses.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a fixed attribute to the AvroPrimitives and AvroOptionalPrimitives record types which are used by the ParquetAvroCompatibilitySuite. These values were populated by taking the same value as other type (\"val_$i\"), padding it to 8 bytes (the chosen fixed length), and storing it as the fixed type. I verified that before my fix the \"required primitives\" and \"optional primitives\" failed with the same exception we're seeing in our clusters. After my change the tests succeed with the expected results.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-14T20:43:30Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T21:38:36Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T00:13:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d6b49312497e00a7f5646a6d87b3c9609dbae2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27ac6af30cde9cd596929ab8fd076c9b41287384","head":{"label":"aws-awinstan:master","ref":"master","sha":"27ac6af30cde9cd596929ab8fd076c9b41287384","user":{"login":"aws-awinstan","id":30934849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTM0ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30934849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan","html_url":"https://github.com/aws-awinstan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125093023,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUwOTMwMjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"aws-awinstan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aws-awinstan","id":30934849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTM0ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30934849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan","html_url":"https://github.com/aws-awinstan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-awinstan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aws-awinstan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith SPARK-20236, `FileCommitProtocol.instantiate()` looks for a three argument constructor, passing in the `dynamicPartitionOverwrite` parameter. If there is no such constructor, it falls back to the classic two-arg one.\r\n\r\nWhen `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` passes down that `dynamicPartitionOverwrite` flag `to FileCommitProtocol.instantiate(`), it assumes that the instantiated protocol supports the specific requirements of dynamic partition overwrite. It does not notice when this does not hold, and so the output generated may be incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes  `FileCommitProtocol.instantiate()` so  when `dynamicPartitionOverwrite == true`, it requires the protocol implementation to have a 3-arg constructor. Classic two arg constructors are supported when it is false.\r\n\r\nAlso it adds some debug level logging for anyone trying to understand what's going on.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests verify that \r\n\r\n* classes with only 2-arg constructor cannot be used with dynamic overwrite\r\n* classes with only 2-arg constructor can be used without dynamic overwrite\r\n* classes with 3 arg constructors can be used with both.\r\n* the fallback to any two arg ctor takes place after the attempt to load the 3-arg ctor,\r\n* passing in invalid class types fail as expected (regression tests on expected behavior)\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-14T18:20:16Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T22:44:17Z","closed_at":"2018-03-16T22:44:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78d52672be3aef786757979ae74a71f9249dde2c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/64602ae97a5318c674d09238f36ff1fec073c97e","head":{"label":"steveloughran:stevel/SPARK-23683-protocol-instantiate","ref":"stevel/SPARK-23683-protocol-instantiate","sha":"64602ae97a5318c674d09238f36ff1fec073c97e","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

with @merlintang  mingjie tang  tangrock@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn order to keep track of the status of Spark ML pipeline, trait MLListenEvent to monitor the [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23674) proposed events was added; trait MLListener  used onEvent method to overide doPostEvent in ListenerBus and post the events to specific listener. \r\n\r\nIn Pipeline.scala, PipelineStage now extends with ListenerBus, so that the related events can be posted to specific listener by doPostEvent. All pipeline related events were posted to all registered listeners by postToAll\r\n\r\nIn ReadWrite.scala, MLWriter now extends with ListenerBus, so that the save-related events can be posted to specific listener\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWhen testing the features, a recorder was created as a mutable buffer to catch/listen to the actual pipeline events, all the events were added to the recorder by the overridden onEvent method in the newly created MLListener, which was add to the object(pipeline/newPipelineModel/pipelineWritter/pipelineModelWritter) corresponding to the operation(fit/transform/save/save) associated with each type of event, finally the actual captured events were compared with the expected events specified in the tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-14T17:58:54Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T04:02:42Z","closed_at":"2019-01-21T04:02:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eff045ca77fdb28e700dd7e1268ea5dd2abae1e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20823/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20823/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20823/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/75b7e857413d7d250f486114b2ccd2884a910751","head":{"label":"jmwdpk:master","ref":"master","sha":"75b7e857413d7d250f486114b2ccd2884a910751","user":{"login":"jmwdpk","id":8153308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTMzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8153308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk","html_url":"https://github.com/jmwdpk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125164657,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNjQ2NTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"jmwdpk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jmwdpk","id":8153308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTMzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8153308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk","html_url":"https://github.com/jmwdpk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwdpk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jmwdpk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nadd a new partition strategy with several advantage:\r\n\r\n1. nicer bound on vertex replication, sqrt(2 * numParts), which is about 23% reducing compare with EdgePartition2D  partition strategy, which has bound 2 * sqrt(numParts). This reduce the shuffle size in several operation such as aggregateMessage and triplets.\r\n2. colocate all edges between two vertices regardless of direction. \r\n3. same work balance compared with EdgePartition2D  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual tests, see

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn our cluster, there are lots of UDF jars, some of them have the same filename but different path, for example:\r\n```\r\nhdfs://A/B/udf.jar  -> udfA\r\nhdfs://C/D/udf.jar  -> udfB\r\n```\r\nWhen user uses udfA and udfB in same sql, executor will fetch both `hdfs://A/B/udf.jar` and `hdfs://C/D/udf.jar` to local. There will be a conflict for the same name. \r\n\r\nCan we config to fetch jars and save with a filename with MD5 prefix, so there will be no conflict.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n UT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPass through the `imagePullSecrets` option to the k8s pod in order to allow user to access private image registries.\r\n\r\nSee https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests + manual testing.\r\n\r\nManual testing procedure:\r\n1. Have private image registry.\r\n2. Spark-submit application with no `spark.kubernetes.imagePullSecret` set. Do `kubectl describe pod ...`. See the error message: \r\n```\r\nError syncing pod, skipping: failed to \"StartContainer\" for \"spark-kubernetes-driver\" with ErrImagePull: \"rpc error: code = 2 desc = Error: Status 400 trying to pull repository ...: \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"errors\\\\\\\" : [ {\\\\n    \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\" : 400,\\\\n    \\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\" : \\\\\\\"Unsupported docker v1 repository request for '...'\\\\\\\"\\\\n  } ]\\\\n}\\\"\"\r\n```\r\n3. Create secret `kubectl create secret docker-registry ...`\r\n4. Spark-submit with `spark.kubernetes.imagePullSecret` set to the new secret. See that deployment was successful.","created_at":"2018-03-13T14:16:25Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T07:40:06Z","closed_at":"2018-04-04T19:34:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f29fb8a7e7cb476ae0748634d92baafdeba80f6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20811/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20811/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20811/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0291f0f8401fe02a927504aca78d13d6ff5d4f55","head":{"label":"andrusha:spark-23668-image-pull-secrets","ref":"spark-23668-image-pull-secrets","sha":"0291f0f8401fe02a927504aca78d13d6ff5d4f55","user":{"login":"andrusha","id":387791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/387791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha","html_url":"https://github.com/andrusha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":117877182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTc4NzcxODI=","name":"spark","full_name":"andrusha/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrusha","id":387791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/387791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha","html_url":"https://github.com/andrusha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrusha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrusha/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrefixSpan API for spark.ml.\r\n\r\nNote: Currently there's no sequential rule mining support in `mllib.PrefixSpan` so we cannot implement `PrefixSpanModel.transform`. In this PR, the transform do nothing. Or we can throw out unsupport-operation exception.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMany algorithms in MLlib are still not migrated their internal computing workload from RDD to DataFrame. `treeAggregate` is one of obstacles we need to address in order to see complete migration.\r\n\r\nThis patch is submitted to provide `treeAggregate` on Dataset API. For now this should be a private API used by ML component.\r\n\r\nThe approach of tree aggregation imitates RDD's `treeAggregate`.\r\n \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn left/right outer joins, constraints derived from the preserved side can be propagated to the null-supplying side (not the other way around). Meanwhile, we do not want to include the join condition in the constraints set since this is an outer join and otherwise is-not-null constraints would be inferred incorrectly.\r\n\r\n1. Add method QueryPlanConstraints#additionalValidConstraintsForInference to accommodate this requirement from the Join operator.\r\n2. Override QueryPlanConstraints#additionalValidConstraintsForInference in the Join operator.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Added 3 new tests in InferFiltersFromConstraintsSuite.\r\n2. Updated 1 test reference in ConstraintsSuitePropagationSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-12T21:21:03Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T19:20:23Z","closed_at":"2018-03-13T19:18:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7bcb2f173e9aabde722e8734b225870b5001adc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/deb4719ee26494c4c097083a8b4079908a0d44c8","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-21479","ref":"spark-21479","sha":"deb4719ee26494c4c097083a8b4079908a0d44c8","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

But it has some problems:\r\n\r\n1. long sql statement cannot be displayed in description column. \r\n![screen shot 2018-03-12 at 14 25 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/37287438-c833385e-263f-11e8-86ea-0f8ebb9b151e.png)\r\n\r\n2. sql statement submitted in spark-shell or spark-submit cannot be covered.\r\n\r\nIn eBay, most spark applications like ETL using spark-submit to schedule their jobs with a few sql files. The sql statement in those applications cannot be saw in current spark UI. Even we get the sql files, there are many variables in the it such as \"select * from ${workingBD}.table where data_col=${TODAY}\".

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current Spark on YARN code, AM always will copy and overwrite its env variables to executors, so we cannot set different values for executors.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce issue, user could start spark-shell like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --master yarn-client --conf spark.executorEnv.SPARK_ABC=executor_val --conf  spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.SPARK_ABC=am_val\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen check executor env variables by\r\n\r\n```\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 1).flatMap \\{ i => sys.env.toSeq }.collect.foreach(println)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will always get `am_val` instead of `executor_val`. So we should not let AM to overwrite specifically set executor env variables.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT and tested in local cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-12T03:33:44Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T08:25:48Z","closed_at":"2018-03-16T08:25:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94b2700cde17864d35ffae0cf635a19a05562696","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20799/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20799/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20799/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2afc91eef55bcbf2e79431d8db64d71fabc21585","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-23635","ref":"SPARK-23635","sha":"2afc91eef55bcbf2e79431d8db64d71fabc21585","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

Besides of that values for 244-252 are not correct according to recent unicode standard for UTF-8: http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/UnicodeStandard-10.0.pdf\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the exception above, the length of input string in UTF-8 encoding cannot be calculated if the string contains chars started from 253 code. It is visible on user's side as for example crashing of schema inferring of csv file which contains such chars but the file can be read if the schema is specified explicitly or if the mode set to multiline.\r\n\r\nThe proposed changes build correct mapping of first byte of UTF-8 char to its size (now it covers all cases) and skip disallowed chars (counts it as one octet).\r\n\r\n## How was

This is because both of them are casted to `string` and then are compared lexicographically. This implementation shows `false` regarding this query `spark.sql(\"select cast('2017-03-01 00:00:00' as timestamp) between cast('2017-02-28' as date) and cast('2017-03-01' as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDAGScheduler becomes a bottleneck in cluster when multiple JobSubmitted events has to be processed as DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop is single threaded and it will block other tasks in queue like TaskCompletion.\r\nThe JobSubmitted event is time consuming depending on the nature of the job (Example: calculating parent stage dependencies, shuffle dependencies, partitions) and thus it blocks all the events to be processed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in my cluster some jobs partition calculation is time consuming (Similar to stack at SPARK-2647) hence it slows down the spark DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop which results in user jobs to slowdown, even if its tasks are finished within seconds, as TaskCompletion Events are processed at a slower rate due to blockage.\r\n\r\nMove the ResultStage creation to call site thread, which will avoid blocking of DAGScheduler thread for other events\r\n\r\nRefer: http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Spark-Scheduler-Spark-DAGScheduler-scheduling-performance-hindered-on-JobSubmitted-Event-td23562.html\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual test to verify blockage before and after applying patch.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-08T06:44:41Z","updated_at":"2019-04-23T03:48:16Z","closed_at":"2019-04-23T03:48:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fbb5d785a9647177cfcfb4f3ee09e81aeb77560c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34cc4dc035f7262678b6561700511e81fe8a368a","head":{"label":"ajithme:sparkDag","ref":"sparkDag","sha":"34cc4dc035f7262678b6561700511e81fe8a368a","user":{"login":"ajithme","id":22072336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDcyMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22072336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme","html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":124182301,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjQxODIzMDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"ajithme/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajithme","id":22072336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDcyMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22072336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme","html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCacheKafkaConsumer in the project `kafka-0-10-sql` is designed to maintain a pool of KafkaConsumers that can be reused. However, it was built with the assumption there will be only one task using trying to read the same Kafka TopicPartition at the same time. Hence, the cache was keyed by the TopicPartition a consumer is supposed to read. And any cases where this assumption may not be true, we have SparkPlan flag to disable the use of a cache. So it was up to the planner to correctly identify when it was not safe to use the cache and set the flag accordingly. \r\n\r\nFundamentally, this is the wrong way to approach the problem. It is HARD for a high-level planner to reason about the low-level execution model, whether there will be multiple tasks in the same query trying to read the same partition. Case in point, 2.3.0 introduced stream-stream joins, and you can build a streaming self-join query on Kafka. It's pretty non-trivial to figure out how this leads to two tasks reading the same partition twice, possibly concurrently. And due to the non-triviality, it is hard to figure this out in the planner and set the flag to avoid the cache / consumer pool. And this can inadvertently lead to ConcurrentModificationException ,or worse, silent reading of incorrect data.\r\n\r\nHere is a better way to design this. The planner shouldnt have to understand these low-level optimizations. Rather the consumer pool should be smart enough avoid concurrent use of a cached consumer. Currently, it tries to do so but incorrectly (the flag inuse is not checked when returning a cached consumer, see [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/external/kafka-0-10-sql/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/kafka010/CachedKafkaConsumer.scala#L403)). If there is another request for the same partition as a currently in-use consumer, the pool should automatically return a fresh consumer that should be closed when the task is done. Then the planner does not have to have a flag to avoid reuses.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a step towards that goal. It does the following. \r\n- There are effectively two kinds of consumer that may be generated \r\n  - Cached consumer - this should be returned to the pool at task end\r\n  - Non-cached consumer - this should be closed at task end\r\n- A trait called KafkaConsumer is introduced to hide this difference from the users of the consumer so that the client code does not have to reason about whether to stop and release. They simply called `val consumer = KafkaConsumer.acquire` and then `consumer.release()`.\r\n- If there is request for a consumer that is in-use, then a new consumer is generated.\r\n- If there is a concurrent attempt of the same task, then a new consumer is generated, and the existing cached consumer is marked for close upon release. \r\n- In addition, I renamed the classes because CachedKafkaConsumer is a misnomer given that what it returns may or may not be cached. \r\n\r\nThis PR does not remove the planner flag to avoid reuse to make this patch safe enough for merging in branch-2.3. This can be done later in master-only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nA new stress test that verifies it is safe to concurrently get consumers for the same partition from the consumer pool.","created_at":"2018-03-08T02:37:22Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T02:29:48Z","closed_at":"2018-03-16T18:14:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2323b8f701daec88cfd0a15ec5fac4f8938eccc6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20767/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20767/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20767/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5363ea8c4a22340fda257658aba122839fe5a15a","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-23623","ref":"SPARK-23623","sha":"5363ea8c4a22340fda257658aba122839fe5a15a","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

is a backport of #20598.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSolved two bugs to enable stream-stream self joins.\r\n\r\n### Incorrect analysis due to missing MultiInstanceRelation trait\r\nStreaming leaf nodes did not extend MultiInstanceRelation, which is necessary for the catalyst analyzer to convert the self-join logical plan DAG into a tree (by creating new instances of the leaf relations). This was causing the error `Failure when resolving conflicting references in Join:` (see JIRA for details).\r\n\r\n### Incorrect attribute rewrite when splicing batch plans in MicroBatchExecution\r\nWhen splicing the source's batch plan into the streaming plan (by replacing the StreamingExecutionPlan), we were rewriting the attribute reference in the streaming plan with the new attribute references from the batch plan. This was incorrectly handling the scenario when multiple StreamingExecutionRelation point to the same source, and therefore eventually point to the same batch plan returned by the source. Here is an example query, and its corresponding plan transformations.\r\n```\r\nval df = input.toDF\r\nval join =\r\n      df.select('value % 5 as \"key\", 'value).join(\r\n        df.select('value % 5 as \"key\", 'value), \"key\")\r\n```\r\nStreaming logical plan before splicing the batch plan\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#1, value#12]\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#1 % 5) AS key#6, value#1]\r\n   :  +- StreamingExecutionRelation Memory[#1], value#1\r\n   +- Project [(value#12 % 5) AS key#9, value#12]\r\n      +- StreamingExecutionRelation Memory[#1], value#12  // two different leaves pointing to same source\r\n```\r\nBatch logical plan after splicing the batch plan and before rewriting\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#1, value#12]\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#1 % 5) AS key#6, value#1]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [value#66]           // replaces StreamingExecutionRelation Memory[#1], value#1\r\n   +- Project [(value#12 % 5) AS key#9, value#12]\r\n      +- LocalRelation [value#66]           // replaces StreamingExecutionRelation Memory[#1], value#12\r\n```\r\nBatch logical plan after rewriting the attributes. Specifically, for spliced, the new output attributes (value#66) replace the earlier output attributes (value#12, and value#1, one for each StreamingExecutionRelation).\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#66, value#66]       // both value#1 and value#12 replaces by value#66\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#66 % 5) AS key#6, value#66]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n   +- Project [(value#66 % 5) AS key#9, value#66]\r\n      +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n```\r\nThis causes the optimizer to eliminate value#66 from one side of the join.\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#66, value#66]\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#66 % 5) AS key#6, value#66]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n   +- Project [(value#66 % 5) AS key#9]   // this does not generate value, incorrect join results\r\n      +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Instead of rewriting attributes, use a Project to introduce aliases between the output attribute references and the new reference generated by the spliced plans. The analyzer and optimizer will take care of the rest.\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#1, value#12]\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#1 % 5) AS key#6, value#1]\r\n   :  +- Project [value#66 AS value#1]   // solution: project with aliases\r\n   :     +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n   +- Project [(value#12 % 5) AS key#9, value#12]\r\n      +- Project [value#66 AS value#12]    // solution: project with aliases\r\n         +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-08T02:02:58Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T08:52:09Z","closed_at":"2018-03-08T08:52:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"869bac3b0dced47b879dd5a786b048de067dd734","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c3ec9ef9355a3290d764dda0191165eaa4e49062","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-23406-2.3","ref":"SPARK-23406-2.3","sha":"c3ec9ef9355a3290d764dda0191165eaa4e49062","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

partition value which cannot be casted to Date (this can happen when there are extra characters after a valid date, like `2018-02-15AAA`).\r\n\r\nWhen this happens and the input format has metadata which define the schema of the table, then `null` is returned as a value for the partition column, because the `cast` operator used in (`PartitioningAwareFileIndex.inferPartitioning`) is unable to convert the value.\r\n\r\nThe PR checks in the partition inference that values can be casted to Date and Timestamp, in order to infer that datatype to them.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds CLI support for YARN custom resources, e.g. GPUs and any other resources YARN defines.\r\nThe custom resources are defined with Spark properties, no additional CLI arguments were introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe properties can be defined in the following form:\r\n\r\n**AM resources, client mode:** \r\nFormat: `spark.yarn.am.resource.<resource-name>`\r\nThe property name follows the naming convention of YARN AM cores / memory properties: `spark.yarn.am.memory and spark.yarn.am.cores\r\n`\r\n\r\n**Driver resources, cluster mode:** \r\nFormat: `spark.yarn.driver.resource.<resource-name>`\r\nThe property name follows the naming convention of driver cores / memory properties: `spark.driver.memory and spark.driver.cores.`\r\n\r\n**Executor resources:** \r\nFormat: `spark.yarn.executor.resource.<resource-name>`\r\nThe property name follows the naming convention of executor cores / memory properties: `spark.executor.memory / spark.executor.cores`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the driver resources (cluster mode) and executor resources properties, we use the `yarn` prefix here as custom resource types are specific to YARN, currently.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Validation:** \r\nPlease note that a validation logic is added to avoid having requested resources defined in 2 ways, for example defining the following configs:\r\n```\r\n\"--conf\", \"spark.driver.memory=2G\",\r\n\"--conf\", \"spark.yarn.driver.resource.memory=1G\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill not start execution and will print an error message.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests + manual execution with Hadoop2 and Hadoop 3 builds.\r\n\r\nTesting have been performed on a real cluster with Spark and YARN configured: \r\nCluster and client mode\r\nRequest Resource Types with lowercase and uppercase units\r\nStart Spark job with only requesting standard resources (mem / cpu)\r\nError handling cases: \r\n- Request unknown resource type\r\n- Request Resource type (either memory / cpu) with duplicate configs at the same time (e.g. with this config: \r\n```\r\n--conf spark.yarn.am.resource.memory=1G \\\r\n  --conf spark.yarn.driver.resource.memory=2G \\\r\n  --conf spark.yarn.executor.resource.memory=3G \\\r\n```\r\n), ResourceTypeValidator handles these cases well, so it is not permitted\r\n- Request standard resource (memory / cpu) with the new style configs, e.g. --conf spark.yarn.am.resource.memory=1G,  this is not permitted and handled well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn example about how I ran the testcases: \r\n```\r\ncd ~;export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop/;\r\n./spark-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-custom-spark/bin/spark-submit \\\r\n  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \\\r\n  --master yarn \\\r\n  --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n  --driver-memory 1G \\\r\n  --driver-cores 1 \\\r\n  --executor-memory 1G \\\r\n  --executor-cores 1 \\\r\n  --conf spark.logConf=true \\\r\n  --conf spark.yarn.executor.resource.gpu=3G \\\r\n  --verbose \\\r\n  ./spark-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-custom-spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \\\r\n  10;\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-07T17:52:05Z","updated_at":"2018-10-23T16:10:43Z","closed_at":"2018-10-13T01:18:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"227e7f75871fce04803feb97f953721828d2b450","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc2e382ff1e468f7e54e14a12fdfcf983b70ea0f","head":{"label":"szilard-nemeth:SPARK-20327","ref":"SPARK-20327","sha":"dc2e382ff1e468f7e54e14a12fdfcf983b70ea0f","user":{"login":"szilard-nemeth","id":954799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NDc5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/954799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth","html_url":"https://github.com/szilard-nemeth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121649508,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjE2NDk1MDg=","name":"spark","full_name":"szilard-nemeth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"szilard-nemeth","id":954799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NDc5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/954799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth","html_url":"https://github.com/szilard-nemeth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szilard-nemeth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/szilard-nemeth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `ExecutorAllocationManager.schedule()`, `numExecutorsTarget` is getting updated as part of `updateAndSyncNumExecutorsTarget(now)` but it skips updating till initializing becomes false, `removeExecutors()` is not removing the expired executors since the condition `else if (newExecutorTotal - 1 < numExecutorsTarget) { ` is satisfying to skip them, and they are missing to remove and continues running till the application completes.\r\n\r\nI moved the `updateAndSyncNumExecutorsTarget(now)` to after the expiry check and initializing var assignment if eligible so that the updated `numExecutorsTarget `can be used while removing executors. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI verified it manually by enabling the dynamic allocation, now it removes the executors when they are not getting assigned any task for the specified executorIdleTimeout.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe currently can only create unsafe rows using code generation. This is a problem for situations in which code generation fails. There is no fallback, and as a result we cannot execute the query.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an interpreted version of `UnsafeProjection`. The implementation is modeled after `InterpretedMutableProjection`. It stores the expression results in a `GenericInternalRow`, and it then uses a conversion function to convert the `GenericInternalRow` into an `UnsafeRow`.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not implement the actual code generated to interpreted fallback logic. This will be done in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI am piggybacking on exiting `UnsafeProjection` tests, and I have added an interpreted version for each of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently， In testing EnsureRequirements's test cases to eliminate ShuffleExchange, The test code is not in conformity with the purpose of the test.These test cases are as follows:\r\n1、`test(\"EnsureRequirements eliminates Exchange if child has same partitioning\")`\r\n   The checking condition is that there is no ShuffleExchange in the physical plan. `= = 2` It's not accurate here.\r\n2、`test(\"EnsureRequirements does not eliminate Exchange with different partitioning\")\r\n`   The purpose of the test is to not eliminate ShuffleExchange, but its test code is the same as` test(\"EnsureRequirements eliminates Exchange if child has same partitioning\")\r\n`\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nthe existed test

the bad news: there's an unfixable race in the launcher code.\r\n(By unfixable I mean it would take a lot more effort than this change\r\nto fix it.) The good news is that it should only affect super short\r\nlived applications, such as the one run by the flaky test, so it's\r\npossible to work around it in our test.\r\n\r\nThe fix also uncovered an issue with the recently added \"closeAndWait()\"\r\nmethod; closing the connection would still possibly cause data loss,\r\nso this change waits a while for the connection to finish itself, and\r\ncloses the socket if that times out. The existing connection timeout\r\nis reused so that if desired it's possible to control how long to wait.\r\n\r\nAs part of that I also restored the old behavior that disconnect() would\r\nforce a disconnection from the child app; the \"wait for data to arrive\"\r\napproach is only taken when disposing of the handle.\r\n\r\nI tested this by inserting a bunch of sleeps in the test and the socket\r\nhandling code in the launcher library; with those I was able to reproduce\r\nthe error from the jenkins jobs. With the changes, even with all the\r\nsleeps still in place, all tests pass.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-06T00:33:10Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T20:29:05Z","closed_at":"2018-03-08T02:14:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90a005078d417cfd027b77007be3ccdfc5224c08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06aa292c15e61170b91f622dbce54a8149c99991","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-23020","ref":"SPARK-23020","sha":"06aa292c15e61170b91f622dbce54a8149c99991","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

change basically rewrites the security documentation so that it's\r\nup to date with new features, more correct, and more complete.\r\n\r\nBecause security is such an important feature, I chose to move all the\r\nrelevant configuration documentation to the security page, instead of\r\nhaving them peppered all over the place in the configuration page. This\r\nallows an almost one-stop shop for security configuration in Spark. The\r\nonly exceptions are some YARN-specific minor features which I left in\r\nthe YARN page.\r\n\r\nI also re-organized the page's topics, since they didn't make a lot of\r\nsense. You had kerberos features described inside paragraphs talking\r\nabout UI access control, and other oddities. It should be easier now\r\nto find information about specific Spark security features. I also\r\nenabled TOCs for both the Security and YARN pages, since that makes it\r\neasier to see what is covered.\r\n\r\nI removed most of the comments from the SecurityManager javadoc since\r\nthey just replicated information in the security doc, with different\r\nlevels of out-of-dateness.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-05T23:11:39Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T21:02:26Z","closed_at":"2018-03-26T19:49:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"010de3031edc13db4a204106ba0c5c1854dbb48e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/53c1710f54888714744b3f0934ceeb732ed88f81","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-23572","ref":"SPARK-23572","sha":"53c1710f54888714744b3f0934ceeb732ed88f81","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMy spark application sometimes will throw `Container killed by YARN for exceeding memory limits`.\r\nEven I increased

The latest config:\r\n<img width=\"685\" alt=\"memory-config\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/36975716-f5c548d2-20b5-11e8-95e5-b228d50917b9.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd error message:\r\n```\r\nExecutorLostFailure (executor 121 exited caused by one of the running tasks) Reason: Container killed by YARN for exceeding memory limits. 30.7 GB of 30 GB physical memory used. Consider boosting spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because of [Linux glibc >= 2.10 (RHEL 6) malloc may show excessive virtual memory usage](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/kevgrig/entry/linux_glibc_2_10_rhel_6_malloc_may_show_excessive_virtual_memory_usage?lang=en). So disable `yarn.nodemanager.vmem-check-enabled` looks like a good option as [MapR mentioned ](https://mapr.com/blog/best-practices-yarn-resource-management).\r\n\r\nThis PR add disable

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe updated the documentation to include more information about the context of Apache Spark. This includes other projects that Apache Spark can interact with but also information about the people that create Apache Spark. We think this provides valuable insight into how Apache Spark fits into the world. \r\n\r\nBoth the changes in the text of the documentation and the included image were created by us. It is our original work which we license to the project under the project’s open source license.\r\n\r\nWe could only change the content in the markdown file, but the image is displayed full-width directly under the text. As far as we could tell, the styling seems to be applied in the documentation website through CSS files. We couldn't really tell how to change and test this. If the current styling isn't acceptable, please let us know how to test any changes in style. We'll mark this PR as [WIP] then, otherwise it should be ready to be merged.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe documentation was tested using the preview functionality of our markdown editor and verified in the Github-rendered markdown page.\r\n##
