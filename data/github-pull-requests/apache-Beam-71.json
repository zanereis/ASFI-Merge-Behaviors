Resolves #24033\r\n- Resolves #23922 \r\n- Resolves #24541\r\n- Resolves #23252\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Migrates to [app_state](https://pub.dev/packages/app_state) for navigation.\r\n- Adds error notifications for example loading and sharing code.\r\n\r\nHere is the chain of causes for this seemingly random set of work:\r\n- When making error notifications, we discovered #24541 that was leading to duplicated notifications because of the duplicated screens.\r\n- The cause of the bug is the architecture of Flutter Navigator 1.0 itself, so workarounds for that are nasty. So we decided to migrate to app_state package because we were going to do this anyway later. This also a step to unify the architecture of Playground and ToB frontends.\r\n- The WIP on #23252 by @Malarg came in handy because it stores an `ExampleLoadingDescriptor` along with an example in `PlaygroundController` which allows to update address bar when the example changes, so it was merged here.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

 While FIleSystem.match, match_files, _list are generator based and in principle support lazy evaluation, GcsIO.list_prefix (and other list_prefix) method makes API calls to fetch all file names of a path, then return a dict. When there are a lots of (millions) files to list, it takes hours even though the call is FileSystem.match(..., limit=1) - asks to return one file.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\nThis resolves duplicate API calls to list files for `ReadFromText` transform. When there are lots of files, it should make 1/2 of the API calls than before (and 1/3 of when validate option is set to True).\r\n\r\nListing files is still not multi threading though, so leave this issue open.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

It should not break any other user code.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step to use \"Avro from extension\" instead of \"Avro from core\".\r\n\r\nCloses #24293\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Spark dataset runner currently materializes and broadcasts `PCollections` used as side-input per consuming `ParDo`.\r\nIf a `PCollection` is used as side-input for multiple `ParDos`, it would be evaluated, collected (on the driver) and finally be broadcasted repeatedly for every such `ParDo` (#24035).\r\n\r\nTo avoid this the broadcast variable is added to `TranslationResult` and will be reused if needed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, on the executor side, memory was wasted because we kept both the broadcasted binary data as well as a cached representation of the deserialized values in memory. \r\n\r\nThis implementation uses Kryo to broadcast the binary data. During deserialization the binary shape is dropped and only deserialized values are kept. Caching is done per partition for `multimap` materialization (using a lru cache). `iterable` materialization is a no-op as serialization is was already done.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change enables the use of AVRO GenericRecord as part of the BigQueryIO storage write implementation (consistent and at-least-once).\r\n\r\nWhen using AVRO GenericRecord as the transport object in their pipelines, users need to configure the use of Beam schemas in the BigQueryIO to transform their data into Beam Rows first, or provide a format function to transform into TableRow, to then have their data formatted as DynamicMessage protos for BQ StorageWrite to work. This PR enables the users to provide a schema (BQ TableSchema, dyn destination or schema from view) and an AvroRowFactoryWriter to have their data transformed to GenericRecord and then StorageWrite compatible protos.\r\n\r\nWhen using GenericRecord as the input type for the PCollection, providing the identity function should be sufficient and inexpensive for their data ingestion.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
