Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-26T09:23:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T02:02:53Z","closed_at":"2022-09-27T02:02:53Z","merged_at":"2022-09-27T02:02:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"2969a54e6c0842b00d82fe9e1da1f1ae6db7e4aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10674/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10674/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10674/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3b2a94f47116d17478065e6ad5c7ddacf3781210","head":{"label":"JiHongYuan:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"3b2a94f47116d17478065e6ad5c7ddacf3781210","user":{"login":"JiHongYuan","id":26153585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTUzNTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26153585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan","html_url":"https://github.com/JiHongYuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":541501569,"node_id":"R_kgDOIEaogQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"JiHongYuan/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JiHongYuan","id":26153585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTUzNTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26153585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan","html_url":"https://github.com/JiHongYuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiHongYuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JiHongYuan/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-26T03:13:41Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T09:25:02Z","closed_at":"2022-10-13T09:25:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5532ba6671327b66c4e5ae43e4b107920cdaa5b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5b2084e2016cf9bdfcda9692b24e96e80752023d","head":{"label":"asa3311:triple-flowcontrol","ref":"triple-flowcontrol","sha":"5b2084e2016cf9bdfcda9692b24e96e80752023d","user":{"login":"asa3311","id":19684366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Njg0MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19684366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311","html_url":"https://github.com/asa3311","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"a66f5126745858f393c67c15d9a84f9e60405aba","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuserco

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-24T10:38:57Z","updated_at":"2022-12-13T08:36:44Z","closed_at":"2022-12-13T08:36:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"067de111274a9eee3e457dbfec57baef5e902641","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/be2df3929e56488b794cb1f1150a59fd3c5e85fc","head":{"label":"dkisser:intergration-benchmark","ref":"intergration-benchmark","sha":"be2df3929e56488b794cb1f1150a59fd3c5e85fc","user":{"login":"dkisser","id":24600271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjAwMjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24600271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser","html_url":"https://github.com/dkisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222401661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI0MDE2NjE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"dkisser/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dkisser","id":24600271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjAwMjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24600271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser","html_url":"https://github.com/dkisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dkisser/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTry using GitHub action to check and automatically add ASF license header.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains two commits, the first commit is submitted by me, the content is to add GitHub action and configuration file .licenserc.yaml, and the second commit is to use License Bot/license_bot@github.com account in GitHub action automatically submitted.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the two files .codecov.yml and .travis.yml have no ASF license header added, so the GitHub action automatically adds the ASF license header and commits it. It is worth noting that this requires the GitHub action. The configuration item permissions.contents has been changed from read to write. I'm not very sure whether this change will bring some bad consequences, but everything is normal at present.\r\n\r\nAnother point to note is that there are some files in the source code that reference other open source licenses, so you need to ignore the check for these files, such as dubbo-common/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/common/threadlocal /InternalThreadLocal.java, the complete list can be viewed in the header.paths-ignore configuration of the .licenserc.yaml file. Because of this, if we introduce other open source licenses in the future development process, we need to add them to the header.paths-ignore configuration item of the .licenserc.yaml file to ignore, otherwise the ASF license header may be duplicated or added incorrectly. this is a hidden danger.\r\n\r\nIncluding if you add an ASF license header containing a spelling error, the GitHub action will also repeatedly add the ASF license header and commit by mistake, so either do not add the ASF license header and be automatically added by the GitHub action, or add the exact ASF license header.\r\n\r\nThe account for committing in GitHub action is License Bot/license_bot@github.com. If there are any that do not meet the requirements, you can replace them with others. This account does not seem to have an avatar.\r\n\r\nIn short, this can save us the step of copying and pasting the ASF license header for each new file, which can be said to improve the efficiency of research and development.\r\n\r\nFinally, thanks.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nMaybe you can look at the log of the GitHub action below to verify some:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/sunchaser-lilu/dubbo/actions/runs/3110713547/jobs/5042180021](https://github.com/sunchaser-lilu/dubbo/actions/runs/3110713547/jobs/5042180021)\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-23T05:35:16Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T06:06:21Z","closed_at":"2022-09-23T06:06:21Z","merged_at":"2022-09-23T06:06:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb0e25e55f1516f1457f6acf9df8ee48cfa492c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e5a2f3f06b9901ce22a07237b1aa45cbb6af72b3","head":{"label":"llnancy:3.1-feature","ref":"3.1-feature","sha":"e5a2f3f06b9901ce22a07237b1aa45cbb6af72b3","user":{"login":"llnancy","id":40930677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTMwNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40930677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy","html_url":"https://github.com/llnancy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"3b0e0487ee30075ca43c3a8820c3d8bae58850a2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T11:09:08Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T07:19:48Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T02:25:54Z","merged_at":"2022-09-21T02:25:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"87fad76407ecbaa02f7300d11ed81bad509e81a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b31ff28b17641816f8cd5bb703c58948fe0730c5","head":{"label":"apache:update-fastjson2","ref":"update-fastjson2","sha":"b31ff28b17641816f8cd5bb703c58948fe0730c5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T05:49:22Z","updated_at":"2022-09-20T08:17:29Z","closed_at":"2022-09-20T08:17:29Z","merged_at":"2022-09-20T08:17:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"2bed0af0cfd10c1f67b4e983c7297f12087d6f0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/32baa1a5ce935e4631e40f93a8cb905413d215bf","head":{"label":"TrueAbc:personal/trueabcV0.6","ref":"personal/trueabcV0.6","sha":"32baa1a5ce935e4631e40f93a8cb905413d215bf","user":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511404486,"node_id":"R_kgDOHntpxg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"TrueAbc/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T03:58:25Z","updated_at":"2022-09-20T07:54:00Z","closed_at":"2022-09-20T07:27:22Z","merged_at":"2022-09-20T07:27:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"37b205bd115dcf6b13d08e4de3163e50063623e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/57","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/57","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/57/labels","id":8311142,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AftFm","number":57,"title":"3.0.12","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-16T09:06:21Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:07Z","due_on":"2022-09-18T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:07Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10644/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10644/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10644/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1c1d25da3e2754fd2f2eb41a8b2c83252e0cb9ce","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/type","ref":"fix/type","sha":"1c1d25da3e2754fd2f2eb41a8b2c83252e0cb9ce","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-19T06:55:19Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T10:01:16Z","closed_at":"2022-09-20T08:15:02Z","merged_at":"2022-09-20T08:15:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"70baad1f96266439a8279fa64adf6508f4eadf79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bb838b2cdbb330b608ab3b841f3ef6fb0bc03a3f","head":{"label":"wuwen5:LocalDateTime_dubbo3","ref":"LocalDateTime_dubbo3","sha":"bb838b2cdbb330b608ab3b841f3ef6fb0bc03a3f","user":{"login":"wuwen5","id":5037807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzc4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5037807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":12370433,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM3MDQzMw==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wuwen5/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuwen5","id":5037807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzc4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5037807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5/dubbo","description":"(3.1.x

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-16T02:28:49Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T10:01:21Z","closed_at":"2022-09-22T07:43:05Z","merged_at":"2022-09-22T07:43:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"c676fb9b72c016c4f93fef5d773e032d74043693","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9923b2ce5e94bb0d27c0712407fb4eb8cecc5b55","head":{"label":"wuwen5:LocalDateTime","ref":"LocalDateTime","sha":"9923b2ce5e94bb0d27c0712407fb4eb8cecc5b55","user":{"login":"wuwen5","id":5037807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzc4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5037807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":12370433,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM3MDQzMw==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wuwen5/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuwen5","id":5037807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzc4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5037807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5/dubbo","description":"(3.1.x

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-15T02:52:28Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T06:50:33Z","closed_at":"2022-09-15T06:50:33Z","merged_at":"2022-09-15T06:50:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"3431d21ace3845986851e02065cfd499b120acb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10623/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10623/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10623/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/440ddf5bce00c641b3f05c8fd451ca7ecdc79d3d","head":{"label":"llnancy:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"440ddf5bce00c641b3f05c8fd451ca7ecdc79d3d","user":{"login":"llnancy","id":40930677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTMwNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40930677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy","html_url":"https://github.com/llnancy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/llnancy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"81fe206b423a9ec9930b8dbe75580b718a178bd6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix `ConcurrentModificationException` when initializing dubbo concurrently.\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\nAssume there are two beans `A` and `B`\r\n\r\n1. `A` is iterating `PropertiesConfiguration` for `prefix` configs.\r\n2. `B` is writing its `Registry/Application/Protocol Config` to `PropertiesConfiguration`\r\n\r\nCuz it is not thread-safe when iterating `HashTable` with `put` concurrently, a `ConcurrentModificationException` will be thrown by `HashTable`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nReturn a copied `Map` under `sync` block.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-14T03:37:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T07:11:51Z","closed_at":"2022-09-19T07:11:51Z","merged_at":"2022-09-19T07:11:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f7d1f37ec7480774951f49ca36025bc89edb76d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/896f04b9588d6892a7ac09bed0bd47faaf37b7c9","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0913_fix_context","ref":"0913_fix_context","sha":"896f04b9588d6892a7ac09bed0bd47faaf37b7c9","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n改动说明：\r\n\r\n1. AbstractServiceNameMapping 所需要的ApplicationModule通过构造方法注入，可以去除 `implements ScopeModelAware`\r\n2. MappingCacheManager#update 方法和父类一致，无需重写，因此可以去掉。\r\n3. AbstractRegistry#getCacheUrls 方法优先从notified中获取缓存的urls列表，因为直接从properties获取需要解析（split）。\r\n4. ZookeeperRegistry#destroy 方法移除childListener监听器。\r\n5. ZookeeperServiceDiscovery#recover 用于在ZK重连后重新注册监听，使用的serviceName应该是先前注册的watcher.getServiceName()，而不是当前消费者应用的serviceName。","created_at":"2022-09-14T02:11:24Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T06:29:22Z","closed_at":"2022-09-15T06:29:22Z","merged_at":"2022-09-15T06:29:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f4f2c0c41f7f86ba9dc127791ae2302b501e828","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3ad70972565787fa56cc4dc423417633da210263","head":{"label":"BurningCN:Fix_recover_method_of_ZookeeperServiceDiscovery","ref":"Fix_recover_method_of_ZookeeperServiceDiscovery","sha":"3ad70972565787fa56cc4dc423417633da210263","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317421885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MjE4ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BurningCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [X] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [X] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [X] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [X] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [X] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-13T08:37:47Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T08:06:56Z","closed_at":"2022-09-14T07:57:11Z","merged_at":"2022-09-14T07:57:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"81fe206b423a9ec9930b8dbe75580b718a178bd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10605/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10605/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10605/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8200ee1baad56c366c39cb9e21e43db083b4e4b7","head":{"label":"JooKS-me:rv-reactive","ref":"rv-reactive","sha":"8200ee1baad56c366c39cb9e21e43db083b4e4b7","user":{"login":"JooKS-me","id":62384022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg0MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62384022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me","html_url":"https://github.com/JooKS-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":413638411,"node_id":"R_kgDOGKefCw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"JooKS-me/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JooKS-me","id":62384022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg0MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62384022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me","html_url":"https://github.com/JooKS-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JooKS-me/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-10T15:10:14Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T06:31:04Z","closed_at":"2022-09-19T06:31:04Z","merged_at":"2022-09-19T06:31:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"43d48bd6caf95f61f4e879a5be8b5560a55daee9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/60781a8e2b69ca9bd2a83a64966b104fe91cd107","head":{"label":"cnjxzhao:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"60781a8e2b69ca9bd2a83a64966b104fe91cd107","user":{"login":"cnjxzhao","id":85160585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTYwNTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85160585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373103481,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMxMDM0ODE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cnjxzhao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cnjxzhao","id":85160585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTYwNTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85160585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-08T10:09:13Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T11:42:18Z","closed_at":"2022-09-08T11:42:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e29c366a26e490386d6d188f5279937d7010aa0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/58","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/58","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/58/labels","id":8311148,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AftFs","number":58,"title":"3.1.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":10,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-16T09:07:19Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T09:34:21Z","due_on":"2022-09-19T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:32Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/74975153bfa9b04f67f943834d32470f0a2154f7","head":{"label":"asa3311:tri-flowcontrol","ref":"tri-flowcontrol","sha":"74975153bfa9b04f67f943834d32470f0a2154f7","user":{"login":"asa3311","id":19684366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Njg0MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19684366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311","html_url":"https://github.com/asa3311","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"9ab939efa067c9a0abcf9c1364abc9a53576f5b9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.git

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-08T07:55:38Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T09:40:57Z","closed_at":"2022-09-09T03:20:32Z","merged_at":"2022-09-09T03:20:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ad527e6e96256a9c0d53ba8a953f7d9e649cf03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/58","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/58","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/58/labels","id":8311148,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AftFs","number":58,"title":"3.1.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":10,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-16T09:07:19Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T09:34:21Z","due_on":"2022-09-19T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:32Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10576/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10576/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10576/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ae56b1f1387b5250f45c6cadd08b793b83e72604","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/reference_creator_log","ref":"feat/reference_creator_log","sha":"ae56b1f1387b5250f45c6cadd08b793b83e72604","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

to [1], it's inappropriate for utility classes (classes with static method only) to use interface with static methods. Although Java 8 provides static methods in interfaces and use it may omit some modifiers, it cannot stop 'subclassing' (for interface, it's 'implementing'). Hence it's appropriate for these utilities to use classes with the 'final' modifier.\r\n\r\nSince these utility classes are all reflection-related, this PR moves them to a separated package.\r\n\r\n根据 [1]，对于一些“工具类” （比如 MethodUtils），使用接口表示并不合适。尽管 Java 8 提供了接口的静态方法，可以省去一些修饰符，但是考虑到接口不能阻止 “子类化” 的发生（对于接口是实现），因此考虑使用 final 修饰的类更合适些。\r\n\r\n另外，由于它们都是反射操作的工具类，这个 PR 将它们移动到单独的包中。\r\n\r\n[1]

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-03T06:51:10Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:51:36Z","closed_at":"2022-09-03T08:51:36Z","merged_at":"2022-09-03T08:51:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb919e9dd38c1de9cdbcb4f3db8815664105ef14","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10540/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10540/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10540/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2d0f3b71b7f44266acaa32168adc8fa47a3cc163","head":{"label":"asa3311:faq-tagrouter","ref":"faq-tagrouter","sha":"2d0f3b71b7f44266acaa32168adc8fa47a3cc163","user":{"login":"asa3311","id":19684366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Njg0MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19684366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311","html_url":"https://github.com/asa3311","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"0b2470286c842c08062d2cbc5d8c22ee448a1da2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFIX #10487\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a minor improvement that could apply to two test cases in `AppResponseTest`(`testSetExceptionWithEmptyStackTraceException` and `testAppResponseWithEmptyStackTraceException`). I will use [testSetExceptionWithEmptyStackTraceException](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/a4052563b779ba0ee8a67eb717b4060698b6960a/dubbo-rpc/dubbo-rpc-api/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/rpc/AppResponseTest.java#L67-L78) as an example.\r\n```java\r\n        Throwable throwable = buildEmptyStackTraceException();\r\n        if (throwable == null) {\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nOn line [68-71](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/a4052563b779ba0ee8a67eb717b4060698b6960a/dubbo-rpc/dubbo-rpc-api/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/rpc/AppResponseTest.java#L68-L71), it uses an if condition to check if a precondition is violated, i.e. “buildEmptyStackTraceException fail to construct NPE” If so, the test case return silently without any further execution. There could be two drawbacks to this:\r\n\r\n1. The if and return make the logic of the test case implicit\r\n2. It may still be worthwhile to execute the test case and see what happens.\r\n\r\nThe assume function, introduced after JUnit 4&5 is designed to check for test pre-condition. As [mentioned in the JUnit 5's document](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.0/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assumptions.html):\r\n\r\nAssume functions is a set of methods useful for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. A failed assumption does not mean the code is broken, but that the test provides no useful information.\r\nThe if block could be replaced by After refactoring:\r\n```java\r\n        Throwable throwable = buildEmptyStackTraceException();\r\n        assumeFalse(throwable == null);\r\n```\r\nThis makes the logic more explicit. Although this is a minor change, it can be applied to the two test cases in this `AppResponseTest `.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nReplace `if (throwable == null) {return;}` with `assumeFalse(throwable == null);` for better code comprehension.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-02T15:19:04Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T06:40:26Z","closed_at":"2022-09-03T06:40:25Z","merged_at":"2022-09-03T06:40:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b2470286c842c08062d2cbc5d8c22ee448a1da2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5dfba93fb07e43840d5399cc7f7b9cd424404e20","head":{"label":"Codegass:refactoring-AppResponseTest","ref":"refactoring-AppResponseTest","sha":"5dfba93fb07e43840d5399cc7f7b9cd424404e20","user":{"login":"Codegass","id":10063370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzMzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10063370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass","html_url":"https://github.com/Codegass","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":468779515,"node_id":"R_kgDOG_EB-w","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Codegass/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Codegass","id":10063370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzMzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10063370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass","html_url":"https://github.com/Codegass","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Codegass/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Codegass/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-02T13:50:20Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T05:49:16Z","closed_at":"2022-09-03T05:49:15Z","merged_at":"2022-09-03T05:49:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"ef14458588d64779424e49868609547908a9e65f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/517a79e963c6c43aabf5c4e3d5d1b46e4e728c72","head":{"label":"asa3311:faq-FailbackClusterInvoker","ref":"faq-FailbackClusterInvoker","sha":"517a79e963c6c43aabf5c4e3d5d1b46e4e728c72","user":{"login":"asa3311","id":19684366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Njg0MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19684366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311","html_url":"https://github.com/asa3311","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"bb7f942c5dc1649ff8e0be939639280e44c731a7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-02T08:38:53Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T09:54:28Z","closed_at":"2022-09-02T09:54:28Z","merged_at":"2022-09-02T09:54:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb7f942c5dc1649ff8e0be939639280e44c731a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/58","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/58","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/58/labels","id":8311148,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AftFs","number":58,"title":"3.1.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":10,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-16T09:07:19Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T09:34:21Z","due_on":"2022-09-19T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:32Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d8bb7873e70f826c541fc0fc5734888d6bb993be","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/spring_status_check","ref":"fix/spring_status_check","sha":"d8bb7873e70f826c541fc0fc5734888d6bb993be","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-02T03:03:07Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T03:03:25Z","closed_at":"2022-09-02T03:03:25Z","merged_at":"2022-09-02T03:03:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"af0d2d2b5858f4ca83f2fc25ccadc6bf7ae50a26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10530/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10530/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10530/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4c148ca64e2c46d625c6a8ce94b1dac6a124f718","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0902_3.0_fix_tostring","ref":"0902_3.0_fix_tostring","sha":"4c148ca64e2c46d625c6a8ce94b1dac6a124f718","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-02T03:00:28Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T03:00:53Z","closed_at":"2022-09-02T03:00:53Z","merged_at":"2022-09-02T03:00:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"c90f8700e217266f899874293aeda7545d50b614","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0b331bc60c949c9977e9d4396cf67ec39b8cc9e5","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0902_3.1_remove_tostrinh","ref":"0902_3.1_remove_tostrinh","sha":"0b331bc60c949c9977e9d4396cf67ec39b8cc9e5","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

PR adds explicit [permissions section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-28T01:53:56Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T01:48:02Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T01:48:02Z","merged_at":"2022-09-01T01:48:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"db210e02d43d477f229958a8869258c868e51b3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e9984ff7c5442fcff8593471098cc744a89f1eb7","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0828_fix_pom","ref":"0828_fix_pom","sha":"e9984ff7c5442fcff8593471098cc744a89f1eb7","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-27T08:08:20Z","updated_at":"2024-05-01T09:38:52Z","closed_at":"2022-08-28T14:06:56Z","merged_at":"2022-08-28T14:06:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb97f45697a5595106b1f1258b11683fad995ca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bbef7f1a3884d87c5c272232df27c4fcebcbb869","head":{"label":"Henrik-Yao:dev_henrik","ref":"dev_henrik","sha":"bbef7f1a3884d87c5c272232df27c4fcebcbb869","user":{"login":"Henrik-Yao","id":77136892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM2ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77136892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao","html_url":"https://github.com/Henrik-Yao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":482140283,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLzgew","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Henrik-Yao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Henrik-Yao","id":77136892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM2ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77136892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao","html_url":"https://github.com/Henrik-Yao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Henrik-Yao/dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-27T04:23:40Z","updated_at":"2022-08-27T04:27:07Z","closed_at":"2022-08-27T04:27:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9948183d9b5dddd727e8562a11b78992a3fd0c45","head":{"label":"Henrik-Yao:metrics_yaohui","ref":"metrics_yaohui","sha":"9948183d9b5dddd727e8562a11b78992a3fd0c45","user":{"login":"Henrik-Yao","id":77136892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM2ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77136892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao","html_url":"https://github.com/Henrik-Yao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":482140283,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLzgew","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Henrik-Yao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Henrik-Yao","id":77136892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM2ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77136892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao","html_url":"https://github.com/Henrik-Yao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Henrik-Yao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Henrik-Yao/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn mesh mode, all traffic governance capabilities can be sunk into sidecar, such as retry, timeout, and load balancing.\r\nTherefore, I added the **unloadclusterrelated** configuration in ReferenceConfig. This configuration is used to determine whether to integrate Cluster, Directory and Router when building the invoker of this call.\r\n\r\nDelegate retry, load balancing, timeout and other traffic management capabilities to Sidecar.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56248584/186416094-a3f78243-c568-4d15-a078-ee676a6f5d12.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n使accesslog更加贴近常用的一些如nginx,tomcat的accesslog打印方式,在业务逻辑处理完成后进行打印,并携带完成时间\r\n1.是否顺便改动date为localtimedate\r\n2.consumer是否也要加一个类似accesslog的filter,这样consumer端和provider进行调用相关的问题排查会更加方便\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-17T13:09:34Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T13:43:32Z","closed_at":"2022-08-17T13:43:32Z","merged_at":"2022-08-17T13:43:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"4da708f3dfdedcc90a4fab94ac5dfafc7b013918","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/55","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55/labels","id":8204251,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfS_b","number":55,"title":"3.0.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-16T08:32:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T02:57:41Z","due_on":"2022-08-16T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:06:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ec4a924bc0d39e6e960394f22781d1bcceff54e8","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0817_fix_executor_pool","ref":"0817_fix_executor_pool","sha":"ec4a924bc0d39e6e960394f22781d1bcceff54e8","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-16T16:51:08Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T04:05:10Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T04:05:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a87bcb3c2298f26832f0fa27d510bdb7520d7713","assignee":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d77326185b693298297fabf27fb5525af1cdefda","head":{"label":"TrueAbc:personal/trueabcV0.4","ref":"personal/trueabcV0.4","sha":"d77326185b693298297fabf27fb5525af1cdefda","user":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511404486,"node_id":"R_kgDOHntpxg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"TrueAbc/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-16T11:56:56Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T08:23:28Z","closed_at":"2022-08-17T08:23:28Z","merged_at":"2022-08-17T08:23:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"670bc915e57ac8be9608fef7f148930f6ddeca6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/57","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/57","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/57/labels","id":8311142,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AftFm","number":57,"title":"3.0.12","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-16T09:06:21Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:07Z","due_on":"2022-09-18T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:07Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0412dfc8000640ab65b81aeee7cd9db507f666e9","head":{"label":"jobop:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"0412dfc8000640ab65b81aeee7cd9db507f666e9","user":{"login":"jobop","id":953083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MzA4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/953083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop","html_url":"https://github.com/jobop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":525332248,"node_id":"R_kgDOH0_vGA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jobop/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jobop","id":953083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MzA4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/953083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop","html_url":"https://github.com/jobop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jobop/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation
