for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEven with the fix in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46824, the escape sequences (`\\r`, `\\n`, `\\t`, etc) are not handled properly. For example, when we use `log\"\\n\"`, the StringContext interprets `\\n` as a literal backslash `\\` followed by `n` instead of a newline character. As a result, the bytes of `log\"\\n\".message` becomes `[92, 110]`, instead of `[10]`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the issue by using the method StringContext.processEscapes in `LogStringContext`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n To ensure that escape sequences are properly processed in Spark logs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes two micro-optimizations for `SparkConf.get(ConfigEntry)`:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid costly `Regex.replaceAllIn` for variable substitution: if the config value does not contain the substring `${` then it cannot possibly contain any variables, so we can completely skip the regex evaluation in such cases.\r\n2. Avoid Scala collections operations, including `List.flatten` and `AbstractIterable.mkString`, for the common case where a configuration does not define a prepended configuration key.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove performance. \r\n\r\nThis is primarily motivated by unit testing and benchmarking scenarios but it will also slightly benefit production queries. \r\n\r\nSpark tries to avoid excessive configuration reading in hot paths (e.g. via changes like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46979). If we do accidentally introduce such read paths, though, then this PR's optimizations will help to greatly reduce the associated perf. penalty.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCorrectness should be covered by existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nTo measure performance, I did some manual benchmarking by running\r\n\r\n```\r\nval conf = new SparkConf()\r\nconf.set(\"spark.network.crypto.enabled\", \"true\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nfollowed by\r\n\r\n```\r\nconf.get(NETWORK_CRYPTO_ENABLED)\r\n```\r\n\r\n10 million times in a loop.\r\n\r\nOn my laptop, the optimized code is ~7.5x higher throughput than the original.\r\n\r\nWe can also compare the before-and-after flamegraphs from a `while(true)` configuration reading loop, showing a clear difference in hotspots before and after this change:\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/50748/a60cec03-2400-46a5-95f5-f33b88a4872a)\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/50748/10a45575-148b-4f5f-a431-b8036fe59866)\r\n\r\n###

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing sequence of queries produces the error:\r\n```\r\n> cache lazy table t as select col from values ('a' collate utf8_lcase) as (col);\r\n> select col from t;\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: not support type: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StringType@1.\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.notSupportTypeError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:1069)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.columnar.ColumnBuilder$.apply(ColumnBuilder.scala:200)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.columnar.DefaultCachedBatchSerializer$$anon$1.$anonfun$next$1(InMemoryRelation.scala:85)\r\n        at scala.collection.immutable.List.map(List.scala:247)\r\n        at scala.collection.immutable.List.map(List.scala:79)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.columnar.DefaultCachedBatchSerializer$$anon$1.next(InMemoryRelation.scala:84)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.columnar.DefaultCachedBatchSerializer$$anon$1.next(InMemoryRelation.scala:82)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.columnar.CachedRDDBuilder$$anon$2.next(InMemoryRelation.scala:296)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.columnar.CachedRDDBuilder$$anon$2.next(InMemoryRelation.scala:293)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis is also the problem on non-lazy cached tables.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the problem happens to occur during the execution of `InMemoryTableScanExec` where we need to update `ColumnAccessor`, `ColumnBuilder`, `ColumnType` and `ColumnStats`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo fix the described error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the described sequence of queries should produce valid results after these changes are applied instead of throwing error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate `Lower` & `Upper` Spark expressions to use ICU case mappings for UTF8_BINARY collation, instead of the currently used JVM case mappings. This behaviour is put under the `ICU_CASE_MAPPINGS_ENABLED` flag in SQLConf, which is `true` by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo keep the consistency between collations - all collations shouls use ICU-based case mappings, including the UTF8_BINARY collation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the behaviour of `lower` & `upper` string functions for UTF8_BINARY will now rely on ICU-based case mappings. However, by turning the `ICU_CASE_MAPPINGS_ENABLED` flag off, users can get the old JVM-based case mappings. Note that the difference between the two is really subtle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests, with extended `CollationSupport` unit tests for Lower/Upper to verify both ICU and JVM behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR improves error reporting in collation space. Currently, when invalid collation name is provided, caller just gets information that collation name can't be accepted. This PR will also return a suggestion on valid collation name that is similar to invalid one that was provided.\r\n\r\nWe propose following rules on generating the suggestion:\r\n1) Find locale that is the closest valid locale measured by Levenshtein distance.\r\n2) Remove duplicate modifiers (e.g. CS_AI_AI_CS becomes CS_AI).\r\n3) Remove invalid combinations (e.g. CS_CI becomes CS).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests for invalid collation names are extended to also cover suggestion checks.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-20T10:25:22Z","updated_at":"2024-06-26T08:02:10Z","closed_at":"2024-06-26T08:02:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"022cb03c6997a86d8d89a8837cd031ddec57709b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ab05041c09c6cf7ec170ddaff940ce8900ccffa7","head":{"label":"dbatomic:collation_suggestion_on_error","ref":"collation_suggestion_on_error","sha":"ab05041c09c6cf7ec170ddaff940ce8900ccffa7","user":{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":722092520,"node_id":"R_kgDOKwpB6A","name":"spark","full_name":"dbatomic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic/spark","description":"Apache

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to support jobs with long `spark.app.name` in K8s. The resource name prefix should be truncated for the resource names to follow [DNS Subdomain Names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names).\r\n\r\nThe current used resource suffixes are as follows:\r\n\r\n- `-driver`\r\n- `-driver-podspec-conf-map`\r\n- `-driver-pvc-$i`\r\n- `-driver-svc`\r\n- `-exec-${executorId}`\r\n- `-exec-${executorId}-pvc-$i`\r\n- `-hadoop-config`\r\n- `-kubernetes-credentials`\r\n- `-delegation-tokens`\r\n- `-kerberos-keytab`\r\n- `-krb5-file`\r\n\r\nAmong them, the longest one is `-driver-podspec-conf-map` of length 24.\r\nThe max length of `-exec-${executorId}-pvc-$i` is also 24, as the max length of `executorId` is 10 (length of Integer.MAX_VALUE) and the max allowed PVC specs is 128 of length 3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when a job with long `spark.app.name` is submitted, K8s will reject the creation of driver pod due to the pod name is exceeded 253.\r\n\r\nError example:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.KubernetesClientException: Failure executing: POST at: https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443/api/v1/namespaces/foo/pods. Message: Pod \"some-super-long-spark-pod-name-exceeded-length-253-driver\" is invalid: metadata.name: Invalid value: \"some-super-long-spark-pod-name-exceeded-length-253-driver\": must be no more than 253 characters. \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users can run jobs on K8s with longer `spark.app.name`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass the CIs with the updated unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

UNSET PROPERTIES` in `v2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- For `table` and `view`, we can `add`, `update`, or `delete` table's `properties` using the following SQL:\r\n```\r\nALTER (TABLE | VIEW) ... SET TBLPROPERTIES ...\r\nALTER (TABLE | VIEW) ... UNSET TBLPROPERTIES (IF EXISTS)? ...\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3469ec6b41967b1b4c7b2549174ed0c199815977/sql/api/src/main/antlr4/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/parser/SqlBaseParser.g4#L148-L151\r\n\r\n- But at the SQL level, there is only `SET` syntax for `namespace`, not `UNSET` syntax\r\n```\r\nALTER namespace ... SET (DBPROPERTIES | PROPERTIES) ...\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3469ec6b41967b1b4c7b2549174ed0c199815977/sql/api/src/main/antlr4/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/parser/SqlBaseParser.g4#L106-L107\r\n\r\n- In addition, the underlying `SupportsNamespaces` interface supports deleting properties. I propose adding SQL syntax to facilitate users to use SQL instead of relying solely on APIs to manipulate the properties of `namespace`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3469ec6b41967b1b4c7b2549174ed0c199815977/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/SupportsNamespaces.java#L127-L137\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3469ec6b41967b1b4c7b2549174ed0c199815977/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/NamespaceChange.java#L59-L61\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, end users can delete the properties of `namespace` through SQL.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR uses `SortShuffleManager#taskIdMapsForShuffle` to track the migrated shuffle files on the destination executor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a long-standing bug in decommission where the migrated shuffle files can't be cleaned up from the executor. Normally, the shuffle files are tracked by `taskIdMapsForShuffle` during the map task execution. Upon receiving the `RemoveShuffle(shuffleId)` request from driver, executor can clean up those shuffle files by searching `taskIdMapsForShuffle`. However, for the migrated shuffle files by decommission, they lose the track in the destination executor's  `taskIdMapsForShuffle` and can't be deleted as a result.\r\n\r\nNote this bug only affects shuffle removal on the executor. For shuffle removal on the external shuffle service (when `spark.shuffle.service.removeShuffle` enabled and the executor stores the shuffle files has gone), we don't rely on `taskIdMapsForShuffle` but using the specific shuffle block id to locate the shuffle file directly. So it won't be an issue there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. (Common users won't see the difference underlying.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded the option to provide a dict to `pyspark.sql.functions.lit` in order to create a map\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make it easier to create a map in pyspark.\r\nCurrently, it is only possible via `create_map` which requires a sequence of key,value,key,value... \r\nScala already supports such functionality using `typedLit`\r\n\r\nA [similar PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37722) was done in the past to add similar functionality for the creating of an array using a list, so I tried to follow all the changes done there as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, docstring of `lit` was edited, and new functionality was added\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\nF.lit({\"a\":1})\r\n# pyspark.errors.exceptions.captured.SparkRuntimeException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.LITERAL_TYPE] The feature is not supported: Literal for '{asd=2}' of class java.util.HashMap.\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\nF.lit({\"a\":1, \"b\": 2})\r\n# Column<'map(a, 1, b, 2)'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests + unittest in CI\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRe-running the collation benchmark with two modifications:\r\n\r\n- UTF8_BINARY_LCASE has been renamed to UTF8_LCASE in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46924\r\n- UTF8_BINARY should appear first in the collation benchmark results, so performance is relative to it\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe've changed the meaning of LCASE collation in Spark, and also modified how equality checks / hashing/ expressions work with this collation, so we need to re-run the benchmarks and identify areas of improvement. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse a double-check locking mechanism to minimize synchronization overhead in `NettyUtils` when calling `getSharedPooledByteBufAllocator`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current way to call `getSharedPooledByteBufAllocator` in `NettyUtils` is inefficient because synchronization can introduce overhead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPrevious [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46665) introduced parser changes for SQL Scripting. This PR is a follow-up to introduce the interpreter for SQL Scripting language and proposes the following changes:\r\n- `SqlScriptingExecutionNode` - introduces execution nodes for SQL scripting, used during interpretation phase:\r\n  - `SingleStatementExec` - executable node for `SingleStatement` logical node; wraps logical plan of the single statement.\r\n  - `CompoundNestedStatementIteratorExec` - implements base recursive iterator logic for all nesting statements.\r\n  - `CompoundBodyExec` - concrete implementation of `CompoundNestedStatementIteratorExec` for `CompoundBody` logical node.\r\n- `SqlScriptingInterpreter` - introduces the interpreter for SQL scripts. Product of interpretation is the iterator over the statements that should be executed.\r\n \r\nFollow-up PRs will introduce further statements, support for exceptions thrown from parser/interpreter, exception handling in SQL, etc.\r\nMore details can be found in [Jira item](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48343) for this task and its parent (where the design doc is uploaded as well).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe intent is to add support for SQL scripting (and stored procedures down the line). It gives users the ability to develop complex logic and ETL entirely in SQL.\r\n\r\nUntil now, users had to write verbose SQL statements or combine SQL + Python to efficiently write the logic. This is an effort to breach that gap and enable complex logic to be written entirely in SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\nThis PR is second in series of PRs that will introduce changes to sql() API to add support for SQL scripting, but for now, the API remains unchanged.\r\nIn the future, the API will remain the same as well, but it will have new possibility to execute SQL scripts.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere are tests for newly introduced parser changes:\r\n- `SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite` - unit tests for execution nodes.\r\n- `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite` - tests for interpreter (with parser integration).\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-19T09:03:39Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T13:15:29Z","closed_at":"2024-07-08T13:15:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d6efdf25caf1afe716da9577d7b53eca0a72d47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9cc6bae75b0a8d102dca7f9c90a33fb4e530bdb6","head":{"label":"davidm-db:sql_scripting_interpreter","ref":"sql_scripting_interpreter","sha":"9cc6bae75b0a8d102dca7f9c90a33fb4e530bdb6","user":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":775065390,"node_id":"R_kgDOLjKPLg","name":"spark","full_name":"davidm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn [SQL Scripting parser PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46665) we didn't notice that import for `scala.collection.immutable.Seq` was added to `AstBuilder` (probably accidentally by IntelliJ). While this import is not unused per se, it is logically not needed (since Scala 2.13, `scala.Seq` is an alias for `scala.collection.immutable.Seq`).\r\n\r\nAnyways, no enforcement was there before and it makes sense to leave it as such. It's not in any way required for SQL Scripting parser change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo remove accidentally added package enforcement that's not needed and wasn't used before.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAlready existing tests cover this change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes encode/decode functions report coding errors instead of mojibake for unmappable characters, take `select encode('渭城朝雨浥轻尘', 'US-ASCII')` as an example\r\n\r\nBefore this PR，\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n???????\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR，\r\n```json\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException\r\n{\r\n  \"errorClass\" : \"MALFORMED_CHARACTER_CODING\",\r\n  \"sqlState\" : \"22000\",\r\n  \"messageParameters\" : {\r\n    \"charset\" : \"US-ASCII\",\r\n    \"function\" : \"`encode`\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove data quality. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nWhen set spark.sql.legacy.codingErrorAction to true, encode/decode functions replace unmappable characters with mojibake instead of reporting coding errors.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew unit tests\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThrows a better exception message when integer overflow happens during calculating the number of partitions for CartesianRDD. Before this PR, the following commands\r\n```\r\nval rdd1 = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 3), numSlices = 65536)\r\nval rdd2 = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 3), numSlices = 65536)\r\nrdd2.cartesian(rdd1).partitions\r\n```\r\nthrow this error message:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0\r\n  at org.apache.spark.rdd.CartesianRDD.$anonfun$getPartitions$2(CartesianRDD.scala:69)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.rdd.CartesianRDD.$anonfun$getPartitions$2$adapted(CartesianRDD.scala:67)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nNow it throws\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArithmeticException: Integer overflows when calculating the number of partitions for CartesianRDD (rdd1 ID = 1 has 65536 partitions; rdd2 ID = 0 has 65536 partitions). Please reduce the number of partitions in the children RDD.\r\n  at org.apache.spark.rdd.CartesianRDD.getPartitions(CartesianRDD.scala:73)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.$anonfun$partitions$2(RDD.scala:340)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThrowing overflow exception upfront is clearer than silently wrapping the multiplication result which might or might not trigger the OOB.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSo number of partitions overflowing is easier to debug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, see the above console output.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n1. Existing tests\r\n2. Manually making sure the error message is updated\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

[<code>maxHeaderSize</code>][] options so\nthat no more headers than the <code>server.maxHeadersCount</code> limit can be sent.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates the Spark on YARN docs to guide users to configure a different JDK for Spark Applications.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs of today, the latest Apache Hadoop 3.4.0 does not support Java 17 yet, while Spark 4.0.0 requires at least Java 17, so users who want to use Spark on YARN must configure a different JDK for Spark applications run on YARN.\r\n\r\nThis is also asked in the mailing list https://lists.apache.org/thread/ply807h0hht1h8o7x7g1s3j51mnot5dr\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it changes the user docs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nI verified the command in a YARN cluster. \r\n\r\nThe following command submits a Spark application with the distributed JDK 21\r\n```\r\nJAVA_HOME=/opt/openjdk-21 spark-submit \\\r\n  --master=yarn \\\r\n  --deploy-mode=cluster \\\r\n  --archives ./openjdk-21.tar.gz \\\r\n  --conf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a Scala port of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46221 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46435.\r\n\r\nA client is unaware of a server restart or the server having closed the client until it receives an error. However, at this point, the client in unable to create a new session to the same connect endpoint, since the stale session is still recorded\r\nas the active and default session.\r\n\r\nWith this change, when the server communicates that the session has changed via a GRPC error, the session and the respective client are marked as stale, thereby allowing a new default connection can be created via the session builder.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, particularly when running older versions of the Spark cluster (3.5), the error actually manifests as a mismatch in the observed server-side session id between calls. With this fix, we also capture this case and ensure that this case is\r\nalso handled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBeing unable to use getOrCreate() after an error is unacceptable and should be fixed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new data source config `ignoreInvalidPartitionPaths` and SQL session configuration flag `spark.sql.files.ignoreInvalidPartitionPaths` to control the behaviour of skipping invalid partition paths (base paths).\r\n\r\nWhen the config is enabled, it allows skipping invalid paths such as:\r\n```\r\ntable/\r\n  invalid/...\r\n  part=1/...\r\n  part=2/... \r\n  part=3/...\r\n```\r\nIn this case, `table/invalid` path will be ignored.\r\n\r\nData source option takes precedence over the SQL config so with the code: \r\n```scala\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.ignoreInvalidPartitionPaths\", \"false\")\r\n\r\nspark.read.format(\"parquet\").option(\"ignoreInvalidPartitionPaths\", \"true\").load(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe query would ignore invalid partitions, i.e. the flag will be enabled.\r\n\r\nThe config is disabled by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAllows ignoring invalid partition paths that cannot be parsed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. The added configs are disabled by default to have the exact same behaviour as before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test for this.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade Maven to 3.9.8.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRelease Note:\r\n- https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.8/release-notes.html\r\n\r\n    > Bug fixes ranges from restored ability (lost in 3.9.7) to build some project that depends on artifact with invalid POMs, OS profile activation issues and many other minor but annoying bugs. The “known issue” (bug) from 3.9.7, [MNG-8116](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-8116) was fixed as well. As part of fix Eclipse Sisu is updated to version 0.9.0.M3, that carries ASM 9.7 (Java 23).\r\n\r\n\r\nBug Fixes:\r\n- [MNG-7758](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7758): o.e.aether.resolution.ArtifactResolutionException incorrectly examined when multiple repositories are involved\r\n- [MNG-8066](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-8066): Maven hangs on self-referencing exceptions\r\n- [MNG-8116](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-8116): Plugin configuration can randomly fail in case of method overloading as it doesn't take into account implementation attribute\r\n- [MNG-8131](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-8131): Property replacement in dependency pom no longer works\r\n- [MNG-8135](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-8135): Profile activation based on OS properties is no longer case insensitive\r\n- [MNG-8142](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-8142): If JDK profile activator gets \"invalid\" JDK version for whatever reason, it chokes but does not tell why\r\n- [MNG-8147](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-8147): Profile interpolation broke their evaluation in case of duplicate IDs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting shortcomings in Spark Connect is that the query execution metrics are not easily accessible directly. In Spark Classic, the query execution is only accessible via the `_jdf` private variable and this is not available in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the first release of Spark Connect, the response messages were already containing the metrics from the executed plan. \r\n\r\nThis patch makes them accessible directly and provides a way to visualize them.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = spark.range(100)\r\ndf.collect()\r\nmetrics = df.executionInfo.metrics\r\nmetrics.toDot()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `toDot()` method returns an instance of the `graphviz.Digraph` object that can be either directly displayed in a notebook or further manipulated.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"909\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/3421/e1710350-54d2-4e6d-9b80-0aaf1b8583e3\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"871\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/3421/6a972119-76b6-4e36-bc81-8d01110fa31c\">\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `executionInfo` property and the associated `ExecutionInfo` class is not to provide equivalence to the `QueryExecution` class used internally by Spark (and, for example, access to the analyzed, optimized, and executed plan) but rather provide a convenient way of accessing execution related information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUser Experience\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdding a new API for accessing the query execution of a Spark SQL execution.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-06-16T20:40:24Z","updated_at":"2024-06-25T23:35:35Z","closed_at":"2024-06-25T23:35:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8e511b52bd52b05bda0d31f9ae44e137a6c68ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(This is the first PR that trying to make the `BlockManagerDecommissioner` event drvien.)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds functionality for `BlockManagerDecommissioner` to do the on-demand shuffle migration peer refresh when there is a peer aborted instead of always relying on the periodical refresh thread (i.e., `shuffleBlockMigrationRefreshExecutor`). \r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, in today's solution, when there is queued peers (i.e., `ShuffleMigrationRunnable`) in `shuffleMigrationPool`, the peer can also be immediately refilled if there is a peer aborted. So the most useful case for this PR is when there is no queued peers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that this PR doesn't remove the periodical refresh thread. Because one on-demmand refresh can't guarantee it can always reach the `STORAGE_DECOMMISSION_SHUFFLE_MAX_THREADS`. (We could probably use a dedicated delayed timer to get rid of the periodical refresh thread totally in the future though.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`BlockManagerDecommissioner` today relies on a periodical thread to refresh the shuffle migration peers and the thread does the refresh every 30s (by default). So when a peer aborted, it can take at most 30s to get a fresh migration peer, which is quite low effeicent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change fixes test \"error during accessing host local dirs for executors\" in ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite, by setting up `blocksByAddress` correctly for the `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` used in the test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe test is for host local blocks, but the `BlockManagerId` was not set up correctly, so `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` would treat those blocks as remote blocks instead.\r\n\r\nThis change is to make the test valid to prevent further breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded an additional check in the test. Also tested locally and verified that the correct code path was reached.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-14T12:56:28Z","updated_at":"2024-06-21T03:14:41Z","closed_at":"2024-06-21T02:38:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fc4c343d646b9b6a4cc4b1b674f254d8cf91224","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3b739b91bc0c866e1f164ded56d705fe1117633","head":{"label":"bozhang2820:spark-48631","ref":"spark-48631","sha":"d3b739b91bc0c866e1f164ded56d705fe1117633","user":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":295316675,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTUzMTY2NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"bozhang2820/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR creates two new SQL functions \"to_avro\" and \"from_avro\" to match existing DataFrame equivalents.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql(\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n    |create table t as\r\n    |  select named_struct('u', named_struct('member0', member0, 'member1', member1)) as s\r\n    |  from values (1, null), (null,

changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis brings parity between SQL and DataFrame APIs in Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds extra unit tests, and I also checked that the functions work with `spark-shell`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo GitHub copilot usage this time","created_at":"2024-06-13T16:50:09Z","updated_at":"2024-06-21T19:12:08Z","closed_at":"2024-06-21T19:12:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6815387a5e969c3f0bbac07320bca5668ffa9e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aa26df3dad9b12ad2190d387b8ac822634c4c715","head":{"label":"dtenedor:from-avro","ref":"from-avro","sha":"aa26df3dad9b12ad2190d387b8ac822634c4c715","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, rule `InsertMapSortInGroupingExpressions` was modified to add an alias for `map_sort(col)` . Grouping and aggregate expressions are then modified to use this alias.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, trying to reference a map column that is being grouped by, causes reference errors because we are only replacing the grouping expression `m` with `map_sort(m)`. The following query fails:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT m FROM table GROUP BY m\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew Tests in this PR, and existing tests regarding grouping of map types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change lets a Scala Spark Connect client reattempt execution of a plan when it receives a SESSION_NOT_FOUND error from the Spark Connect service if it has not received any partial responses.\r\n\r\nThis is a Scala version of the previous fix of the same issue - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46297.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark Connect clients often get a spurious error from the Spark Connect service if the service is busy or the network is congested. This error leads to a situation where the client immediately attempts to reattach without the service being aware of the client; this leads to a query failure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPrevoiusly, a Scala Spark Connect client would fail with the error code \"INVALID_HANDLE.SESSION_NOT_FOUND\" in the very first attempt to make a request to the service, but with this change, the client will automatically retry.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAttached unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefer to the suggestion of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43563#pullrequestreview-2114900378, this pr add handling for `Stream` where `LazyList.force` is called.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEven though `Stream` is deprecated in 2.13, it is not _removed_ and thus is is possible that some parts of Spark / Catalyst (or third-party code) might continue to pass around `Stream` instances. Hence, we should restore the call to `Stream.force` where `.force` is called on `LazyList`, to avoid losing the eager materialization for Streams that happen to flow to these call sites. This is also a guarantee of compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd some new tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nLog `TID` for \"input split\" in `HadoopRDD` and `NewHadoopRDD`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change should benefit both structured logging enabled/disabled cases.\r\n\r\nWhen structured logging is disabled, and executor cores > 1, the logs of tasks are mixed in stdout, something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n24/06/12 21:40:10 INFO Executor: Running task 26.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 10)\r\n24/06/12 21:40:10 INFO Executor: Running task 27.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 11)\r\n24/06/12 21:40:11 INFO HadoopRDD: Input split: hdfs://.../part-00025-53bc40ae-399f-4291-b5ac-617c980deb86-c000:0+124138257\r\n24/06/12 21:40:11 INFO HadoopRDD: Input split: hdfs://.../part-00045-53bc40ae-399f-4291-b5ac-617c980deb86-c000:0+121726684\r\n```\r\nit's hard to say which file is read by which task because they run in parallel.\r\n\r\nIf something goes wrong, the log prints `TID` and exception stack trace, the error may related to the input data, sometimes that `exception message` is clear enough to show which file that input data comes from, but sometimes not, in the latter case, the current log is not clear enough to allow us to identify the bad file quickly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n24/06/12 21:40:18 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 27.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 11)\r\n(... exception message)\r\n(... stacktraces)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen structured logging is enabled, exposing TID as a LogKey makes the logs more selective.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it supplies additional information in logs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nReview, as it only touches log contents.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nrefactor: In `ExplainUtils.processPlan`, use auxiliary idMap instead of OP_ID_TAG\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45282 introduced synchronize to `ExplainUtils.processPlan`  to avoid race condition when multiple queries refers to same cached plan.\r\n\r\nThe granularity of lock is too large. We can try to fix the root cause of this concurrency issue by refactoring the usage of mutable `OP_ID_TAG`, which is not a good practice in terms of immutable nature of SparkPlan.  \r\n\r\nInstead, we can use an auxiliary id map, with object identity as the key. The entire scope of `OP_ID_TAG` usage is within `ExplainUtils.processPlan`, therefore it's safe to do so, with thread local to make it available in other involved classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to display the driver thread first on the thread dump page by defining a custom `threadInfoOrdering`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, there is an ordering rule to display the task threads first on the executor thread dump page, it does improve the user experience in troubleshooting \"task stuck\" issues. There are a lot of similar stuck issues on the driver's side too. For example, I hit two frequent cases in my daily support:\r\n1. Spark Driver is blocked on the user code that is written in the \"main function\".\r\n2. When NameNode has high pressures, Spark Driver is blocked on HDFS calls.\r\n\r\nIn YARN cluster mode, the \"main function\" runs in \"Driver\" thread, in other modes like Local, K8s, YARN client mode, the \"main function\" runs in \"main\" thread. So I think displaying these two threads first should improve UX in troubleshooting \"driver stuck\" issues. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it affects the default thread's display order on the thread dump page.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `df.mergeInto` support for Spark Connect Scala and Python clients.\r\n\r\nThis work contains four components:\r\n\r\n1. New Protobuf messages: command `MergeIntoTableCommand` and expression `MergeAction`.\r\n2. Spark Connect planner change: translate proto messages into real `MergeIntoCommand`s.\r\n3. Connect Scala client: `MetgeIntoWriter` that allows users to build merges.\r\n4. Connect Python client: `MetgeIntoWriter` that allows users to build merges.\r\n\r\nComponents 3 and 4 and independent to each other. They both depends on Component 1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe need to increase the functionality of Spark Connect to be on par with Classic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, new Dataframe APIs are introduced.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor some data sources, CHAR type padding is not applied on both the write and read sides (by disabling `spark.sql.readSideCharPadding`), as a different SQL flavor, which is similar to MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/char.html\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a bug in Spark that we always pad the string literal when comparing CHAR type and STRING literals, which assumes the CHAR type columns are always padded, either on the write side or read side. This is not always true.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes Spark always pad the CHAR type columns when comparing with string literals, to satisfy the CHAR type semantic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nbug fix if people disable read side char padding\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. After this PR, comparing CHAR type with STRING literals follows the CHAR semantic, while before it mostly returns false.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-47911, we introduced a universal BinaryFormatter to make binary output consistent\r\nacross all clients, such as beeline, spark-sql, and spark-shell, for both primitive and nested binaries.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, `to_csv` and `csv writer` have interceptors for binary output which is hard-coded to use `SparkStringUtils.getHexString`. In this PR we make it also configurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfeature parity\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, we have make spark.sql.binaryOutputStyle work for csv but the AS-IS behavior is kept.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->no\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-12T12:16:33Z","updated_at":"2024-06-17T00:41:47Z","closed_at":"2024-06-13T03:50:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3f4719a5fd163f0a4d4d97c73511343ef1a89e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e886603b2e6a59b31248127510199c22b5805ec3","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-48602","ref":"SPARK-48602","sha":"e886603b2e6a59b31248127510199c22b5805ec3","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357976080,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc5NzYwODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"yaooqinn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn/spark","description":"Apache
