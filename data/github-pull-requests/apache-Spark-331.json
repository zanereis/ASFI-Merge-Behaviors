What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`SparkSession`' companion object `Builder` inner class presents several implementations for config setter which are exact copies of the same method just varying the value input type.\r\n\r\nThere are setters for `Double`, `Long` and `Boolean`. And the three of them transform the input value into an string via the default `.toString` method.\r\n\r\nThese are basic types and, therefore, child classes of `AnyVal`. Why explicitly enumerating them in a set of methods replicating code?\r\n\r\nThe `config` implementation for `String` values can be invoke by a single method.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to: \r\n\r\n- Reduce the amount of replicated code. That implies that further code updates will require modifying different methods with the dangers derived from possible oversights.\r\n- Increase the code readability.\r\n- Add all Scala basic types as possible inputs for the builder configuration pseudo-dsl implemented by `SparkSession#Builder`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PRs changes the implementation of already tested, by the current test suites. Hence, no more testing has been added as no actual functionality is added.","created_at":"2017-02-06T16:51:39Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T18:56:35Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T18:05:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c3f86cb0a40881d1b9b2c2287568e8037027f840","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16823/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16823/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16823/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/736fedefb41fd33ce58b44d86924673b56c58e0f","head":{"label":"pfcoperez:sparksession_buildersimplification","ref":"sparksession_buildersimplification","sha":"736fedefb41fd33ce58b44d86924673b56c58e0f","user":{"login":"pfcoperez","id":273379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzM3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/273379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez","html_url":"https://github.com/pfcoperez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"aff53021cf828cd7c139d8ec230d45593078b73a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe SQL parser can mistake a `WHEN (...)` used in `CASE` for a function call. This happens in cases like the following:\r\n```sql\r\nselect case when (1) + case when 1 > 0 then 1 else 0 end = 2 then 1 else 0 end\r\nfrom tb\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes this by re-organizing the case related parsing rules.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a regression test to the `ExpressionParserSuite`.","created_at":"2017-02-06T15:11:43Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T20:30:54Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T20:30:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12ab96d74b819311e71db2389ae9838586361310","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/870f29820b704c4ee73bb07e12db187a923a15e2","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-19472","ref":"SPARK-19472","sha":"870f29820b704c4ee73bb07e12db187a923a15e2","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt adds trueValue and falseValue options for customising the values used for Boolean types in CSV files.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReading from an existing ORC table which contains `char` or `varchar` columns can fail with a `ClassCastException` if the table metadata has been created using Spark. This is caused by the fact that spark internally replaces `char` and `varchar` columns with a `string` column.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by adding the hive type to the `StructField's` metadata under the `HIVE_TYPE_STRING` key. This is picked up by the `HiveClient` and the ORC reader, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16060 for more details on how the metadata is used.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a regression test to `OrcSourceSuite`.","created_at":"2017-02-04T11:06:28Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T00:37:02Z","closed_at":"2017-02-10T19:09:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3eadbf8dfed5d2a90ebeec707ee5a7abbca853d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16804/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16804/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16804/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21be4ca7f4fb987ab467c6bcbed2db10e0cdbeb9","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-19459","ref":"SPARK-19459","sha":"21be4ca7f4fb987ab467c6bcbed2db10e0cdbeb9","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently when we new a HiveClient for a specific metastore version and `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` is setted to `maven`, Spark will download the hive jars from remote repo(http://www.datanucleus.org/downloads/maven2).\r\n\r\nwe should allow the user to load hive jars from the user defined repos(e.g.local repo which has already downloaded), and user defined repos should take priority order than default repos(e.g. ${user.home}/.m2/repository)\r\n\r\nthe similar way which is to be referenced from `SparkSubmit` processing `--packages`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L289-L298\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the Failed/Killed Task End events come after the Job End event then these task events are simply getting ignored without considering/updating into JobUIData. It is happening because jobId information is getting deleted from stageIdToActiveJobIds during the Job End event and Task End event is not able to find the Job information to update. \r\n\r\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\n- Add spark.sql.parquet.caseInsensitiveResolution config option\r\n- Add caseInsensitive option to ParquetReadSupport.clipParquetType\r\n- Add ParquetIOSuite test\r\n- Disable Parquet filter push-down when using case-insensitive field resolution\r\n\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\n[*Copied from SPARK-19455*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19455)\r\n\r\n[SPARK-16980](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16980) removed the schema inferrence from the HiveMetastoreCatalog class when converting a MetastoreRelation to a LoigcalRelation (HadoopFsRelation, in this case) in favor of simply using the schema returend by the metastore. This results in an optimization as the underlying file status no longer need to be resolved until after the partition pruning step, reducing the number of files to be touched significantly in some cases. The downside is that the data schema used may no longer match the underlying file schema for case-sensitive formats such as Parquet.\r\n\r\nThis change initially included a [patch to ParquetReadSupport](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6ce1b675ee9fc9a6034439c3ca00441f9f172f84/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetReadSupport.scala#L270-L284) that attempted to remedy this conflict by using a case-insentive fallback mapping when resolving field names during the schema clipping step. [SPARK-1833](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18333) later removed this patch after [SPARK-17183](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17183) added support for embedding a case-sensitive schema as a Hive Metastore table property. AFAIK the assumption here was that the data schema obtained from the Metastore table property will be case sensitive and should match the Parquet schema exactly.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when dealing with Parquet-backed tables for which this schema has not been embedded as a table attributes and for which the underlying files contain case-sensitive field names. This will happen for any Hive table that was not created by Spark or created by a version prior to 2.1.0. We've seen Spark SQL return no results for any query containing a case-sensitive field name for such tables.\r\n\r\nThe change we're proposing is to introduce a configuration parameter that will re-enable case-insensitive field name resolution in ParquetReadSupport. This option will also disable filter push-down for Parquet, as the filter predicate constructed by Spark SQL contains the case-insensitive field names which Parquet will return 0 records for when filtering against a case-sensitive column name. I was hoping to find a way to construct the filter on-the-fly in ParquetReadSupport but Parquet doesn't propegate the Configuration object passed to this class to the underlying InternalParquetRecordReader class.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis test re-introduces a unit test to ParquetSchemaSuite.scala to test that case-insensitive schema clipping behaves as expected. It also introduces a ParquetIOSuite unit test that constructs a case-insensitive catalog table and ensures case-sensitive Parquet data can still be queried against.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter using Apache Parquet 1.8.2, `ParquetAvroCompatibilitySuite` fails on **Maven** test. It is because `org.apache.parquet.avro.AvroParquetWriter` in the test code used new `avro 1.8.0` specific class, `LogicalType`. This PR aims to fix the test dependency of `sql/core` module to use avro 1.8.0.\r\n\r\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.7/2530/consoleFull\r\n\r\n```\r\nParquetAvroCompatibilitySuite:\r\n***

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`askSync` is already added in `RpcEndpointRef` (see SPARK-19347 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16690#issuecomment-276850068) and `askWithRetry` is marked as deprecated. \r\nAs mentioned SPARK-18113(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16503#event-927953218):\r\n\r\n>askWithRetry is basically an unneeded API, and a leftover from the akka days that doesn't make sense anymore. It's prone to cause deadlocks (exactly because it's blocking), it imposes restrictions on the caller (e.g. idempotency) and other things that people generally don't pay that much attention to when using it.\r\n\r\nSince `askWithRetry` is just used inside spark and not in user logic. It might make sense to replace all of them with `askSync`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis PR doesn't change code logic, existing unit test can cover.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-03T17:33:14Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T12:52:32Z","closed_at":"2017-02-19T12:36:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70c62734c69e62b5501e60cb95e6dd3c2b5396ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16790/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16790/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16790/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b575c55ed9901b4dcf5b3e977a55f135b02aa4b1","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-19450","ref":"SPARK-19450","sha":"b575c55ed9901b4dcf5b3e977a55f135b02aa4b1","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis issue is originally reported and discussed at http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/SQL-ML-Pipeline-performance-regression-between-1-6-and-2-x-tc20803.html\r\n\r\nWhen run a ML `Pipeline` with many stages, during the iterative updating to `Dataset` , it is observed the it takes longer time to finish the fit and transform as the query plan grows continuously.\r\n\r\nThe example code show as the following in benchmark.\r\n\r\nSpecially, the time spent on preparing optimized plan in current branch is much higher than 1.6. Actually, the time is spent mostly on generating query plan's constraints during few optimization rules.\r\n\r\n`getAliasedConstraints` is found to be a function costing most of the running time. As the constraints for aliasing will increase very fast.\r\n\r\nThis patch tries to improve the performance of `getAliasedConstraints`.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\n\r\nRun the following codes locally.\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.spark.ml.{Pipeline, PipelineStage}\r\n    import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.{OneHotEncoder, StringIndexer, VectorAssembler}\r\n\r\n    val df = (1 to 40).foldLeft(Seq((1, \"foo\"), (2, \"bar\"), (3, \"baz\")).toDF(\"id\", \"x0\"))((df, i) => df.withColumn(s\"x$i\", $\"x0\"))\r\n\r\n    val indexers = df.columns.tail.map(c => new StringIndexer()\r\n      .setInputCol(c)\r\n      .setOutputCol(s\"${c}_indexed\")\r\n      .setHandleInvalid(\"skip\"))\r\n\r\n    val encoders = indexers.map(indexer => new OneHotEncoder()\r\n      .setInputCol(indexer.getOutputCol)\r\n      .setOutputCol(s\"${indexer.getOutputCol}_encoded\")\r\n      .setDropLast(true))\r\n\r\n    val stages: Array[PipelineStage] = indexers ++ encoders\r\n    val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(stages)\r\n\r\n    val startTime = System.nanoTime\r\n    pipeline.fit(df).transform(df).show\r\n    val runningTime = System.nanoTime - startTime\r\n\r\nBefore this patch: 1786001 ms\r\nAfter this patch: 843688 ms\r\n\r\nMore than half of original running time is saved.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-03T07:27:54Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:34:19Z","closed_at":"2017-03-31T13:28:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54807fa23bedb25c987f0a912b2b97cddf0e7a37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16785/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16785/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16785/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/278c31cf8aa27c71e0f5178bebcb426ec5fba6ce","head":{"label":"viirya:improve-constraints-generation","ref":"improve-constraints-generation","sha":"278c31cf8aa27c71e0f5178bebcb426ec5fba6ce","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `@keyword_only` decorator in PySpark is not thread-safe.  It writes kwargs to a static class variable in the decorator, which is then retrieved later in the class method as `_input_kwargs`.  If multiple threads are constructing the same class with different kwargs, it becomes a race condition to read from the static class variable before it's overwritten.  See [SPARK-19348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19348) for reproduction code.\r\n\r\nThis change will write the kwargs to a member variable so that multiple threads can operate on separate instances without the race condition.  It does not protect against multiple threads operating on a single instance, but that is better left to the user to synchronize.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests for using the keyword_only decorator and a regression test that verifies `_input_kwargs` can be overwritten from different class instances.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-02T23:26:36Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T23:36:08Z","closed_at":"2017-03-04T00:46:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09931ee83961255bd58ced62072d6ff773cbf01e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16782/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16782/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16782/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e5783209dff55a6010ca17da819542f7a1cdb12c","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:pyspark-keyword_only-threadsafe-SPARK-19348","ref":"pyspark-keyword_only-threadsafe-SPARK-19348","sha":"e5783209dff55a6010ca17da819542f7a1cdb12c","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently when handle `RegisterExecutor` in `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend`, `executorDataMap` is guarded by `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.this.synchronized` when updating, which can cause `numPendingExecutors` incorrect. \r\nCode is like below:\r\n```\r\n        if (executorDataMap.contains(executorId)) {\r\n          executorRef.send(RegisterExecutorFailed(\"Duplicate executor ID: \" + executorId))\r\n          context.reply(true)\r\n        } else {\r\n          ...\r\n          CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.this.synchronized {\r\n            executorDataMap.put(executorId, data)\r\n            if (currentExecutorIdCounter < executorId.toInt) {\r\n              currentExecutorIdCounter = executorId.toInt\r\n            }\r\n            if (numPendingExecutors > 0) {\r\n              numPendingExecutors -= 1\r\n              logDebug(s\"Decremented number of pending executors ($numPendingExecutors left)\")\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n```\r\nConsider SPARK-19437 and a scenario like below:\r\nAn executor sent `RegisterExecutor` twice by `askWithRetry`, and the interval between the two is quite small. Thus it might be possible that both of them will go to `else` branch, thus `numPendingExecutors` will be deducted twice and become incorrect. Currently, the `askWithRetry` of `RegisterExecutor` only exists in some unit tests, but it makes sense to make it stronger when handling `RegisterExecutor`.\r\n\r\n**TO FIX**\r\nUse CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.this.synchronized to guard executorDataMap when both reading and updating.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe code logic is not changed, just manually tested. SPARK-19437 can also help verify this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current code in `HeartbeatReceiverSuite`, executorId is set as below:\r\n```\r\n  private val executorId1 = \"executor-1\"\r\n  private val executorId2 = \"executor-2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe executorId is sent to driver when register as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest(\"expire dead hosts should kill executors with replacement (SPARK-8119)\")  {\r\n  ...\r\n  fakeSchedulerBackend.driverEndpoint.askSync[Boolean](\r\n      RegisterExecutor(executorId1, dummyExecutorEndpointRef1, \"1.2.3.4\", 0, Map.empty))\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReceiving `RegisterExecutor` in `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend`, the executorId will be compared with `currentExecutorIdCounter` as below:\r\n```\r\ncase RegisterExecutor(executorId, executorRef, hostname, cores, logUrls)  =>\r\n  if (executorDataMap.contains(executorId)) {\r\n    executorRef.send(RegisterExecutorFailed(\"Duplicate executor ID: \" + executorId))\r\n    context.reply(true)\r\n  } else {\r\n  ...\r\n  executorDataMap.put(executorId, data)\r\n  if (currentExecutorIdCounter < executorId.toInt) {\r\n    currentExecutorIdCounter = executorId.toInt\r\n  }\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`executorId.toInt` will cause NumberformatException.\r\n\r\nThis unit test can pass currently because of `askWithRetry`, when catching exception, RPC will call again, thus it will go `if` branch and return true.\r\n\r\n**To fix**\r\nRectify executorId and replace `askWithRetry` with `askSync`, refer to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16690\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis fix is for unit test and no need to add another one.(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor a `Pipeline` including long stages, the iterative fit and transform cause extremely grown query plans and RDD lineages, it takes longer time to finish the fit and transform.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces `PeriodicDatasetCheckpointer` to do periodic checkout for dataset used in `fit` and `transform`.\r\n\r\n<del>This introduces new param `checkpointInterval` to `Pipeline` and `PipelineModel`. Once it is set, we will do periodic checkout by `PeriodicDatasetCheckpointer`.</del>\r\n\r\nAs there is existing trait `HasCheckpointInterval` which already defines `checkpointInterval` param. This patch lets `Pipeline` and `PipelineModel` extend `HasCheckpointInterval`.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\n\r\nRun the following codes locally.\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.spark.ml.{Pipeline,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModified `CrossValidator` and `TrainValidationSplit` to be able to evaluate models in parallel for a given parameter grid.  The level of parallelism is controlled by a parameter `numParallelEval` used to schedule a number of models to be trained/evaluated so that the jobs can be run concurrently.  This is a naive approach that does not check the cluster for needed resources, so care must be taken by the user to tune the parameter appropriately.  The default value is `1` which will train/evaluate in serial. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests for CrossValidator and TrainValidationSplit to verify that model selection is the same when run in serial vs parallel.  Manual testing to verify tasks run in parallel when param is > 1. Added parameter usage to relevant examples.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-02T00:04:36Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T00:33:31Z","closed_at":"2017-09-06T12:15:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d27e365c73cc3bfd83889a7e0a4dd82f464f3bef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a8221ba939da026a9818299cf2b897ea81766a5","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:parallel-model-eval-SPARK-19357","ref":"parallel-model-eval-SPARK-19357","sha":"7a8221ba939da026a9818299cf2b897ea81766a5","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded a class method to construct CountVectorizerModel from a list of vocabulary strings, equivalent to the Scala version.  Introduced a common param base class `_CountVectorizerParams` to allow the Python model to also own the parameters.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDataFrame.except doesn't work for UDT columns. It is because `ExtractEquiJoinKeys` will run `Literal.default` against UDT. However, we don't handle UDT in `Literal.default` and an exception will throw like:\r\n\r\n    java.lang.RuntimeException: no default for type \r\n    org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.VectorUDT@3bfc3ba7\r\n      at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal$.default(literals.scala:179)\r\n      at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.planning.ExtractEquiJoinKeys$$anonfun$4.apply(patterns.scala:117)\r\n      at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.planning.ExtractEquiJoinKeys$$anonfun$4.apply(patterns.scala:110)\r\n\r\nMore simple fix is just let `Literal.default` handle UDT by its sql type. So we can use more efficient join type on UDT.\r\n\r\nBesides `except`, this also fixes other similar scenarios, so in summary this fixes: \r\n\r\n* `except` on two Datasets with UDT\r\n* `intersect` on two Datasets with UDT\r\n* `Join` with the join conditions using `<=>` on UDT columns\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are two issues in the existing detection of cartesian products. \r\n\r\n1) When users use the outer joins where both sides of the tables are unable to be broadcasted, Spark will still select `BroadcastNestedLoopJoin`. CROSS JOIN syntax is unable to cover the scenario of outer join, but we still issue the following error message:\r\n```\r\nUse the CROSS JOIN syntax to allow cartesian products between these relations\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) The existing detection is unable to cover all the cartesian product cases. For example, \r\n  - Case 1) only having non-equal predicates in join conditions for an inner join. e.g., `tab1.a < tab2.b`\r\n  - Case 2) equi-join's key columns are not sortable and both sides are not small enough for broadcasting and shuffling. That means, it is not qualified for either broadcast hash/shuffle join or sort merge joins.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to move the cross-join detection back to `BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec` and `CartesianProductExec`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the extra test cases.","created_at":"2017-02-01T06:14:28Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T17:06:56Z","closed_at":"2017-05-23T17:06:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ecd34eedd2c08ec26add7c7174682e96fd63066b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/98cd60cb627274d18f8198e99d724470676c399e","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:crossJoin","ref":"crossJoin","sha":"98cd60cb627274d18f8198e99d724470676c399e","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`mapGroupsWithState` is a new API for arbitrary stateful operations in Structured Streaming, similar to `DStream.mapWithState` \r\n\r\n*Requirements*\r\n- Users should be able to specify a function that can do the following\r\n- Access the input row corresponding to a key\r\n- Access the previous state corresponding to a key\r\n- Optionally, update or remove the state\r\n- Output any number of new rows (or none at all)\r\n\r\n*Proposed API*\r\n```\r\n// ------------ New methods on KeyValueGroupedDataset ------------\r\nclass KeyValueGroupedDataset[K, V] {\t\r\n\t// Scala friendly\r\n\tdef mapGroupsWithState[S: Encoder, U: Encoder](func: (K, Iterator[V], KeyedState[S]) => U)\r\n        def flatMapGroupsWithState[S: Encode, U: Encoder](func: (K, Iterator[V], KeyedState[S]) => Iterator[U])\r\n\t// Java friendly\r\n       def mapGroupsWithState[S, U](func: MapGroupsWithStateFunction[K, V, S, R], stateEncoder: Encoder[S], resultEncoder: Encoder[U])\r\n       def flatMapGroupsWithState[S, U](func: FlatMapGroupsWithStateFunction[K, V, S, R], stateEncoder: Encoder[S], resultEncoder: Encoder[U])\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ------------------- New Java-friendly function classes ------------------- \r\npublic interface MapGroupsWithStateFunction<K, V, S, R> extends Serializable {\r\n  R call(K key, Iterator<V> values, state: KeyedState<S>) throws Exception;\r\n}\r\npublic interface FlatMapGroupsWithStateFunction<K, V, S, R> extends Serializable {\r\n  Iterator<R> call(K key, Iterator<V> values, state: KeyedState<S>) throws Exception;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ---------------------- Wrapper class for state data ---------------------- \r\ntrait KeyedState[S] {\r\n\tdef exists(): Boolean  \t\r\n  \tdef get(): S \t\t\t// throws Exception is state does not exist\r\n\tdef getOption(): Option[S]       \r\n\tdef update(newState: S): Unit\r\n\tdef remove(): Unit\t\t// exists() will be false after this\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey Semantics of the State class\r\n- The state can be null.\r\n- If the state.remove() is called, then state.exists() will return false, and getOption will returm None.\r\n- After that state.update(newState) is called, then state.exists() will return true, and getOption will return Some(...). \r\n- None of the operations are thread-safe. This is to avoid memory barriers.\r\n\r\n*Usage*\r\n```\r\nval stateFunc = (word: String, words: Iterator[String, runningCount: KeyedState[Long]) => {\r\n    val newCount = words.size + runningCount.getOption.getOrElse(0L)\r\n    runningCount.update(newCount)\r\n   (word, newCount)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndataset\t\t\t\t\t                        // type is Dataset[String]\r\n  .groupByKey[String](w => w)        \t                // generates KeyValueGroupedDataset[String, String]\r\n  .mapGroupsWithState[Long, (String, Long)](stateFunc)\t// returns Dataset[(String, Long)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2017-01-31T19:16:30Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T05:33:57Z","closed_at":"2017-02-08T04:23:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"969b3907c6dc3c5e3d59cf7a3b7fbc0267c12cd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3d12311229a958fee5fb3cfcf4f6b33035fc87f","head":{"label":"tdas:mapWithState","ref":"mapWithState","sha":"f3d12311229a958fee5fb3cfcf4f6b33035fc87f","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe optimizer tries to remove redundant alias only projections from the query plan using the `RemoveAliasOnlyProject` rule. The current rule identifies removes such a project and rewrites the project's attributes in the **entire** tree. This causes problems when parts of the tree are duplicated (for instance a self join on a temporary view/CTE)  and the duplicated part contains the alias only project, in this case the rewrite will break the tree. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these problems by using a blacklist for attributes that are not to be moved, and by making sure that attribute remapping is only done for the parent tree, and not for unrelated parts of the query plan.\r\n\r\nThe current tree transformation infrastructure works very well if the transformation at hand requires little or a global contextual information. In this case we need to know both the attributes that were not to be moved, and we also needed to know which child attributes were modified. This cannot be done easily using the current infrastructure, and solutions typically involves transversing the query plan multiple times (which is super slow). I have moved around some code in `TreeNode`, `QueryPlan` and `LogicalPlan`to make this much more straightforward; this basically allows you to manually traverse the tree.\r\n\r\nThis PR subsumes the following PRs by @windpiger:\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16267\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16255\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have added unit tests to `RemoveRedundantAliasAndProjectSuite` and I have added integration tests to the `SQLQueryTestSuite.union` and `SQLQueryTestSuite.cte` test cases.","created_at":"2017-01-31T16:47:15Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T07:33:30Z","closed_at":"2017-02-07T21:31:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a866ed10fd798dd3346ce17c50a9f5d8950597a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29c469643bdab299cafd4fbbd657d34601c0e690","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-18609","ref":"SPARK-18609","sha":"29c469643bdab299cafd4fbbd657d34601c0e690","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR deduplicates arguments, `url` and `table` in `JdbcUtils` with `JDBCOptions`.\r\n\r\nIt avoids to use duplicated arguments, for example, as below:\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval jdbcOptions = new JDBCOptions(url, table, map)\r\nJdbcUtils.saveTable(ds, url, table, jdbcOptions)\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval jdbcOptions = new JDBCOptions(url, table, map)\r\nJdbcUtils.saveTable(ds, jdbcOptions)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRunning unit test in `JdbcSuite`/`JDBCWriteSuite`\r\n\r\nBuilding with Scala 2.10 as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.10\r\n./build/mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.4 -Dscala-2.10 -DskipTests clean

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up pr of #16308.\r\n\r\nThis pr enables timezone support in CSV/JSON parsing.\r\n\r\nWe should introduce `timeZone` option for CSV/JSON datasources (the default value of the option is session local timezone).\r\n\r\nThe datasources should use the `timeZone` option to format/parse to write/read timestamp values.\r\nNotice that while reading, if the timestampFormat has the timezone info, the timezone will not be used because we should respect the timezone in the values.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have timestamp `\"2016-01-01 00:00:00\"` in `GMT`, the values written with the default timezone option, which is `\"GMT\"` because session local timezone is `\"GMT\"` here, are:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"GMT\")\r\n\r\nscala> val df = Seq(new java.sql.Timestamp(1451606400000L)).toDF(\"ts\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [ts: timestamp]\r\n\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|ts                 |\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|2016-01-01 00:00:00|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> df.write.json(\"/path/to/gmtjson\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cat /path/to/gmtjson/part-*\r\n{\"ts\":\"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas setting the option to `\"PST\"`, they are:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> df.write.option(\"timeZone\", \"PST\").json(\"/path/to/pstjson\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cat /path/to/pstjson/part-*\r\n{\"ts\":\"2015-12-31T16:00:00.000-08:00\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can properly read these files even if the timezone option is wrong because the timestamp values have timezone info:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val schema = new StructType().add(\"ts\", TimestampType)\r\nschema: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType = StructType(StructField(ts,TimestampType,true))\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(schema).json(\"/path/to/gmtjson\").show()\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|ts                 |\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|2016-01-01 00:00:00|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(schema).option(\"timeZone\", \"PST\").json(\"/path/to/gmtjson\").show()\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|ts                 |\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|2016-01-01 00:00:00|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd even if `timezoneFormat` doesn't contain timezone info, we can properly read the values with setting correct timezone option:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> df.write.option(\"timestampFormat\", \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss\").option(\"timeZone\", \"JST\").json(\"/path/to/jstjson\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cat /path/to/jstjson/part-*\r\n{\"ts\":\"2016-01-01T09:00:00\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// wrong result\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(schema).option(\"timestampFormat\", \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss\").json(\"/path/to/jstjson\").show()\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|ts                 |\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|2016-01-01 09:00:00|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n\r\n//

The default string datatype equivalent I used is a 255 character/byte length varchar. This effectively limits the max number of string columns to 250 when using the Teradata jdbc connector.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded a teradataDialect for JDBC connection to Teradata. The Teradata dialect uses VARCHAR(255) in place of TEXT for string datatypes, and CHAR(1) in place of BIT(1) for boolean datatypes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added two unit tests to double check that the types get set correctly for a teradata jdbc url. I also ran a couple manual tests to make sure the jdbc connector worked with teradata and to make sure that an error was thrown if a row could potentially exceed 64K (this error comes from the teradata jdbc connector, not from the spark code). I did not check how string columns longer than 255 characters are handled.","created_at":"2017-01-30T22:17:25Z","updated_at":"2017-05-24T01:11:02Z","closed_at":"2017-05-23T19:04:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f7b98df3a0612eec4ece315953dd47cec6566ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91e12e1b30ea94b7f56471acfb98784758ddc0f3","head":{"label":"klinvill:master","ref":"master","sha":"91e12e1b30ea94b7f56471acfb98784758ddc0f3","user":{"login":"klinvill","id":6043161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDMxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6043161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill","html_url":"https://github.com/klinvill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80109676,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDEwOTY3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"klinvill/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"klinvill","id":6043161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDMxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6043161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill","html_url":"https://github.com/klinvill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klinvill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/klinvill/spark","description":"Mirror

Add dependency on aws-java-sdk-sts\r\n- Replace SerializableAWSCredentials with new SerializableCredentialsProvider interface\r\n- Make KinesisReceiver take SerializableCredentialsProvider as argument

API\r\n- Update KCL/AWS SDK dependencies to 1.7.x/1.11.x\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[JIRA link with detailed description.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19405)\r\n\r\n* Replace SerializableAWSCredentials with new SerializableKCLAuthProvider class that takes 5 optional config params for configuring AWS auth and returns the appropriate credential provider object\r\n* Add new public createStream() APIs for specifying these parameters in KinesisUtils\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Manually tested using explicit keypair and instance profile to read data from Kinesis stream in separate account (difficult to write a test orchestrating creation and assumption of IAM roles across separate accounts)\r\n* Expanded JavaKinesisStreamSuite to test the entire Java API in KinesisUtils\r\n\r\n## License acknowledgement\r\nThis contribution is my original work and that

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs per the bug, the state corresponding to app failures are not getting registered with call back to the launcher.So, the already available isFailed() check of TaskState.scala, is utilized to send the explicit status of SparkAppHandle.State.FAILED back to the launcherBackend, which under the hood updates the status for (LOST == state) || (FAILED == state).\r\nThe already available TaskState.isFinished() is used to set the value SparkAppHandle.State.FINISHED, as under the hood, it considers FINISHED, FAILED, KILLED, LOST as part of FINISHED state.\r\nSince the isFailed() is checked first, the isFinished is checked in the else if condition to get the mutually exclusive scenarios.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested manually. The tests included, by simply submitting local jobs, the states are set correctly. Also, the tests included with some fail prone codes executed and tested the status set as FAILED. It looks difficult to write testcase to create an error prone scnario code and check the status.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-30T17:50:17Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:06Z","closed_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9273193a0327ff88717f1d26974989cf00cb19e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6d431789b7f390612b82ba8305439de3f047de1","head":{"label":"thomastechs:thomastechs-19379","ref":"thomastechs-19379","sha":"e6d431789b7f390612b82ba8305439de3f047de1","user":{"login":"thomastechs","id":2070810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2070810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs","html_url":"https://github.com/thomastechs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48816612,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODgxNjYxMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"thomastechs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thomastechs","id":2070810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2070810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs","html_url":"https://github.com/thomastechs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thomastechs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPrior to Spark 2.1, the option names are case sensitive for all the formats. Since Spark 2.1, the option key names become case insensitive except the format `Text` and `LibSVM `. This PR is to fix these issues.\r\n\r\nAlso, add a check to know whether the input option vector type is legal for `LibSVM`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptimization [SPARK-12869] was made for dense matrices but caused great performance issue for sparse matrices because manipulating them is very

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `coefficients` component in model summary should be 'matrix' but the underlying structure is indeed list. This affects several models except for 'AFTSurvivalRegressionModel' which has the correct implementation. The fix is to first `unlist` the coefficients returned from the `callJMethod` before converting to matrix. An example illustrates the issues:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata(iris)\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(iris)\r\nmodel <- spark.glm(df, Sepal_Length ~ Sepal_Width, family = \"gaussian\")\r\ns <- summary(model)\r\n\r\n> str(s$coefficients)\r\nList of 8\r\n $ : num 6.53\r\n $ : num -0.223\r\n $ : num 0.479\r\n $ : num 0.155\r\n $ : num 13.6\r\n $ : num -1.44\r\n $ : num 0\r\n $ : num 0.152\r\n - attr(*, \"dim\")= int [1:2] 2 4\r\n - attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\r\n  ..$ : chr [1:2] \"(Intercept)\" \"Sepal_Width\"\r\n  ..$ : chr [1:4] \"Estimate\" \"Std. Error\" \"t value\" \"Pr(>|t|)\"\r\n> s$coefficients[, 2]\r\n$`(Intercept)`\r\n[1] 0.4788963\r\n\r\n$Sepal_Width\r\n[1] 0.1550809\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis  shows that the underlying structure of coefficients is still `list`. \r\n\r\n@felixcheung @wangmiao1981

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to revert the changes made in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16700. It could cause the data loss after partition rename, because we have a bug in the file renaming. \r\n\r\nNot all the OSs have the same behaviors. For example, on mac OS, if we renaming a path from `.../tbl/a=5/b=6` to `.../tbl/A=5/B=6`. The result is `.../tbl/a=5/B=6`. The expected result is `.../tbl/A=5/B=6`. Thus, renaming on mac OS is not recursive. However, the systems used in Jenkin does not have such an issue. Although this PR is not the root cause, it exposes an existing issue on the code `tablePath.getFileSystem(hadoopConf).rename(wrongPath, rightPath)`\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nHive metastore is not case preserving and keep partition columns with lower case names.\r\n\r\nIf SparkSQL create a table with upper-case partion name use HiveExternalCatalog, when we rename partition, it first call the HiveClient to renamePartition, which will create a new lower case partition path, then SparkSql rename the lower case path to the upper-case.\r\n\r\nwhile if the renamed partition contains more than one depth partition ,e.g. A=1/B=2, hive renamePartition change to a=1/b=2, then SparkSql rename it to A=1/B=2, but the a=1 still exists in the filesystem, we should also delete it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A","created_at":"2017-01-28T19:33:08Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T21:34:50Z","closed_at":"2017-01-28T21:34:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de75b8b739defa3cd516aa056afa619e8ac7261b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16728/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16728/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16728/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a398036ec957e8d9d67f038095408f576a13c982","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:revert-pr-16700","ref":"revert-pr-16700","sha":"a398036ec957e8d9d67f038095408f576a13c982","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror
